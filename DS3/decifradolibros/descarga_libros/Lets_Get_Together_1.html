They would scarcely have known how to react hadthey discovered that a kind of war had finally come.</p><p>Certainly, Elias Lynn, Chief of the Bureau of Robotics, wasn't surehow he ought to react when <i>he</i> finally found out. The Bureau ofRobotics was headquartered in Cheyenne, in line with the century-oldtrend toward decentralization, and Lynn stared dubiously at the youngSecurity officer from Washington who had brought the news.</p><p>Elias Lynn was a large man, almost charmingly homely, with pale blueeyes that bulged a bit. Men weren't usually comfortable under the stareof those eyes, but the Security officer remained calm.</p><p>Lynn decided that his first reaction ought to be incredulity. Hell, it<i>was</i> incredulity! He just didn't believe it!</p><p>He eased himself back in his chair and said, "How certain is theinformation?"</p><p>The Security officer, who had introduced himself as Ralph G.Breckenridge and had presented credentials to match, had the softnessof youth about him; full lips, plump cheeks that flushed easily,and guileless eyes. His clothing was out of line with Cheyenne butit suited a universally air-conditioned Washington, where Security,despite everything, was still centered.</p><p>Breckenridge flushed and said, "There's no doubt about it."</p><p>"You people know all about Them, I suppose," said Lynn and was unableto keep a trace of sarcasm out of his tone. He was not particularlyaware of his use of a slightly-stressed pronoun in his reference to theenemy, the equivalent of capitalization in print. It was a culturalhabit of this generation and the one preceding. No one said the "East,"or the "Reds" or the "Soviets" or the "Russians" any more. That wouldhave been too confusing, since some of Them weren't of the East,weren't Reds, Soviets, and especially not Russians. It was much simplerto say We and They, and much more precise.</p><p>Travelers had frequently reported that They did the same in reverse.Over there, They were "We" (in the appropriate language) and We were"They."</p><p>Scarcely anyone gave thought to such things any more. It was all quitecomfortable and casual. There was no hatred, even. At the beginning,it had been called a Cold War. Now it was only a game, almost agood-natured game, with unspoken rules and a kind of decency about it.</p><p>Lynn said, abruptly, "Why should They want to disturb the situation?"</p><p>He rose and stood staring at a wall-map of the world, split into tworegions with faint edgings of color. An irregular portion on the leftof the map was edged in a mild green. A smaller, but just as irregular,portion on the right of the map was bordered in a washed-out pink. Weand They.</p><p>The map hadn't changed much in a century. The loss of Formosa andthe gain of East Germany some eighty years before had been the lastterritorial switch of importance.</p><p>There had been another change, though, that was significant enough andthat was in the colors. Two generations before, Their territory hadbeen a brooding, bloody red, Ours a pure and undefiled white. Now therewas a neutrality about the colors. Lynn had seen Their maps and it wasthe same on Their side.</p><p>"They wouldn't do it," he said.</p><p>"They are doing it," said Breckenridge, "and you had better accustomyourself to the fact. Of course, sir, I realize that it isn't pleasantto think that they may be that far ahead of us in robotics."</p><p>His eyes remained as guileless as ever, but the hidden knife-edges ofthe words plunged deep, and Lynn quivered at the impact.</p><p>Of course, that would account for why the Chief of Robotics learned ofthis so late and through a Security officer at that. He had lost castein the eyes of the Government; if Robotics had really failed in thestruggle, Lynn could expect no political mercy.</p><p>Lynn said wearily, "Even if what you say is true, they're not far aheadof us. We could build humanoid robots."</p><p>"Have we, sir?"</p><p>"Yes. As a matter of fact, we have built a few models for experimentalpurposes."</p><p>"They were doing so ten years ago. They've made ten years' progresssince."</p><p>Lynn was disturbed. He wondered if his incredulity concerning the wholebusiness were really the result of wounded pride and fear for his joband reputation. He was embarrassed by the possibility that this mightbe so, and yet he was forced into defense.</p><p>He said, "Look, young man, the stalemate between Them and Us was neverperfect in every detail, you know. They have always been ahead in onefacet or another and We in some other facet or another. If They'reahead of us right now in robotics, it's because They've placed agreater proportion of Their effort into robotics than We have. And thatmeans that some other branch of endeavor has received a greater shareof Our efforts than it has of Theirs. It would mean We're ahead inforce-field research or in hyper-atomics, perhaps."</p><p>Lynn felt distressed at his own statement that the stalemate wasn'tperfect. It was true enough, but that was the one great dangerthreatening the world. The world depended on the stalemate being asperfect as possible. If the small unevennesses that always existedover-balanced too far in one direction or the other&mdash;</p><p>Almost at the beginning of what had been the Cold War, both sideshad developed thermonuclear weapons, and war became unthinkable.Competition switched from the military to the economic andpsychological and had stayed there ever since.</p><p>But always there was the driving effort on each side to break thestalemate, to develop a parry for every possible thrust, to developa thrust that could not be parried in time&mdash;something that would makewar possible again. And that was not because either side wanted war sodesperately, but because both were afraid that the other side wouldmake the crucial discovery first.</p><p>For a hundred years each side had kept the struggle even. And in theprocess, peace had been maintained for a hundred years while, asbyproducts of the continuously intensive research, force-fields hadbeen produced and solar energy and insect control and robots. Each sidewas making a beginning in the understanding of mentalics, which was thename given to the biochemistry and biophysics of thought. Each side hadits outposts on the Moon and on Mars. Mankind was advancing in giantstrides under forced draft.</p><p>It was even necessary for both sides to be as decent and humane aspossible among themselves, lest through cruelty and tyranny, friends bemade for the other side.</p><p>It couldn't be that the stalemate would now be broken and that therewould be war.</p><p>Lynn said, "I want to consult one of my men. I want his opinion."</p><p>"Is he trustworthy?"</p><p>Lynn looked disgusted. "Good Lord, what man in Robotics has not beeninvestigated and cleared to death by your people? Yes, I vouch forhim. If you can't trust a man like Humphrey Carl Laszlo, then we're inno position to face the kind of attack you say They are launching, nomatter what else we do."</p><p>"I've heard of Laszlo," said Breckenridge.</p><p>"Good. Does he pass?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Then, I'll have him in and we'll find out what he thinks about thepossibility that robots could invade the U. S. A."</p><p>"Not exactly," said Breckenridge, softly. "You still don't accept thefull truth. Find out what he thinks about the fact that robots have<i>already</i> invaded the U. S. A."</p><hr class="tb" /><p>Laszlo was the grandson of a Hungarian who had broken through whathad then been called the Iron Curtain, and he had a comfortableabove-suspicion feeling about himself because of it. He was thick-setand balding with a pugnacious look graven forever on his snub face, buthis accent was clear Harvard and he was almost excessively soft-spoken.</p><p>To Lynn, who was conscious that after years of administration he was nolonger expert in the various phases of modern robotics, Laszlo was acomforting receptacle for complete knowledge. Lynn felt better becauseof the man's mere presence.</p><p>Lynn said, "What do you think?"</p><p>A scowl twisted Laszlo's face ferociously. "That They're that far aheadof us. Completely incredible. It would mean They've produced humanoidsthat could not be told from humans at close quarters. It would mean aconsiderable advance in robo-mentalics."</p><p>"You're personally involved," said Breckenridge, coldly. "Leavingprofessional pride out of account, exactly why is it impossible thatThey be ahead of Us?"</p><p>Laszlo shrugged. "I assure you that I'm well acquainted with Theirliterature on robotics. I know approximately where They are."</p><p>"You know approximately where They want you to <i>think</i> They are, iswhat you really mean," corrected Breckenridge. "Have you ever visitedthe other side?"</p><p>"I haven't," said Laszlo, shortly.</p><p>"Nor you, Dr. Lynn?"</p><p>Lynn said, "No, I haven't, either."</p><p>Breckenridge said, "Has any robotics man visited the other side intwenty-five years?" He asked the question with a kind of confidencethat indicated he knew the answer.</p><p>For a matter of seconds, the atmosphere was heavy with thought.Discomfort crossed Laszlo's broad face. He said, "As a matter of fact,They haven't held any conferences on robotics in a long time."</p><p>"In twenty-five years," said Breckenridge. "Isn't that significant?"</p><p>"Maybe," said Laszlo, reluctantly. "Something else bothers me, though.None of Them have ever come to Our conferences on robotics. None that Ican remember."</p><p>"Were They invited?" asked Breckenridge.</p><p>Lynn, staring and worried, interposed quickly, "Of course."</p><p>Breckenridge said, "Do They refuse attendance to any other types ofscientific conferences We hold?"</p><p>"I don't know," said Laszlo. He was pacing the floor now. "I haven'theard of any cases. Have you, Chief?"</p><p>"No," said Lynn.</p><p>Breckenridge said, "Wouldn't you say it was as though They didn't wantto be put in the position of having to return any such invitation? Oras though They were afraid one of Their men might talk too much?"</p><p>That was exactly how it seemed, and Lynn felt a helpless convictionthat Security's story was true after all steal over him.</p><p>Why else had there been no contact between sides on robotics? Therehad been a cross-fertilizing trickle of researchers moving in bothdirections on a strictly one-for-one basis for years, dating backto the days of Eisenhower and Khrushchev. There were a great manygood motives for that: an honest appreciation of the supra-nationalcharacter of science; impulses of friendliness that are hard to wipeout completely in the individual human being; the desire to be exposedto a fresh and interesting outlook and to have your own slightly-stalenotions greeted by others as fresh and interesting.</p><p>The governments themselves were anxious that this continue. There wasalways the obvious thought that by learning all you could and tellingas little as you could, your own side would gain by the exchange.</p><p>But not in the case of robotics. Not there.</p><p>Such a little thing to carry conviction. And a thing, moreover, theyhad known all along. Lynn thought, darkly: We've taken the complacentway out.</p><p>Because the other side had done nothing publicly on robotics, it hadbeen tempting to sit back smugly and be comfortable in the assurance ofsuperiority. Why hadn't it seemed possible, even likely, that They werehiding superior cards, a trump hand, for the proper time?</p><p>Laszlo said, shakenly, "What do we do?" It was obvious that the sameline of thought had carried the same conviction to him.</p><p>"Do?" parroted Lynn. It was hard to think right now of anything but ofthe complete horror that came with conviction. There were ten humanoidrobots somewhere in the United States, each one carrying a fragment ofa TC bomb.</p><p>TC! The race for sheer horror in bomb-ery had ended there. TC! TotalConversion! The sun was no longer a synonym one could use. Totalconversion made the sun a penny candle.</p><p>Ten humanoids, each completely harmless in separation, could, by thesimple act of coming together, exceed critical mass and&mdash;</p><p>Lynn rose to his feet heavily, the dark pouches under his eyes, whichordinarily lent his ugly face a look of savage foreboding, moreprominent than ever. "It's going to be up to us to figure out waysand means of telling a humanoid from a human and then finding thehumanoids."</p><p>"How quickly?" muttered Laszlo.</p><p>"Not later than five minutes before they get together," barked Lynn,"and I don't know when that will be."</p><p>Breckenridge nodded. "I'm glad you're with us now, sir. I'm to bringyou back to Washington for conference, you know."</p><p>Lynn raised his eyebrows. "All right."</p><p>He wondered if, had he delayed longer in being convinced, he mightnot have been replaced forthwith&mdash;if some other Chief of the Bureauof Robotics might not be conferring in Washington. He suddenly wishedearnestly that exactly that had come to pass.</p><hr class="tb" /><p>The First Presidential Assistant was there, the Secretary of Science,the Secretary of Security, Lynn himself, and Breckenridge. Five of themsitting about a table in the dungeons of an underground fortress nearWashington.</p><p>Presidential Assistant Jeffreys was an impressive man, handsome in awhite-haired and just-a-trifle-jowly fashion, solid, thoughtful and asunobtrusive, politically, as a Presidential Assistant ought to be.</p><p>He spoke incisively. "There are three questions that face us as I seeit. First, when are the humanoids going to get together? Second, whereare they going to get together? Third, how do we stop them before theyget together?"</p><p>Secretary of Science Amberley nodded convulsively at that. He had beenDean of Northwestern Engineering before his appointment. He was thin,sharp-featured and noticeably edgy. His forefinger traced slow circleson the table.</p><p>"As far as <i>when</i> they'll get together," he said. "I suppose it'sdefinite that it won't be for some time."</p><p>"Why do you say that?" asked Lynn, sharply.</p><p>"They've been in the U. S. at least a month already. So Security says."</p><p>Lynn turned automatically to look at Breckenridge, and Secretary ofSecurity Macalaster intercepted the glance. Macalaster said, "Theinformation is reliable. Don't let Breckenridge's apparent youth foolyou, Dr. Lynn. That's part of his value to us. Actually, he's 34 andhas been with the department for ten years. He has been in Moscow fornearly a year and without him, none of this terrible danger would beknown to us. As it is, we have most of the details."</p><p>"Not the crucial ones," said Lynn.</p><p>Macalaster of Security smiled frostily. His heavy chin and close-seteyes were well-known to the public but almost nothing else about himwas. He said, "We are all finitely human, Dr. Lynn. Agent Breckenridgehas done a great deal."</p><p>Presidential Assistant Jeffreys cut in. "Let us say we have a certainamount of time. If action at the instant were necessary, it wouldhave happened before this. It seems likely that they are waiting fora specific time. If we knew the place, perhaps the time would becomeself-evident.</p><p>"If they are going to TC a target, they will want to cripple us as muchas possible, so it would seem that a major city would have to be it.In any case, a major metropolis is the only target worth a TC bomb. Ithink there are four possibilities: Washington, as the administrativecenter; New York, as the financial center; and Detroit and Pittsburghas the two chief industrial centers."</p><p>Macalaster of Security said, "I vote for New York. Administrationand industry have both been decentralized to the point where thedestruction of any one particular city won't prevent instantretaliation."</p><p>"Then why New York?" asked Amberly of Science, perhaps more sharplythan he intended. "Finance has been decentralized as well."</p><p>"A question of morale. It may be they intend to destroy our will toresist, to induce surrender by the sheer horror of the first blow.The greatest destruction of human life would be in the New YorkMetropolitan area&mdash;"</p><p>"Pretty cold-blooded," muttered Lynn.</p><p>"I know," said Macalaster of Security, "but they're capable of it, ifthey thought it would mean final victory at a stroke. Wouldn't we&mdash;"</p><p>Presidential Assistant Jeffreys brushed back his white hair. "Let'sassume the worst. Let's assume that New York will be destroyed sometime during the winter, preferably immediately after a serious blizzardwhen communications are at their worst and the disruption of utilitiesand food supplies in fringe areas will be most serious in their effect.Now, how do we stop them?"</p><p>Amberley of Science could only say, "Finding ten men in two hundred andtwenty million is an awfully small needle in an awfully large haystack."</p><p>Jeffreys shook his head. "You have it wrong. Ten humanoids among twohundred twenty million humans."</p><p>"No difference," said Amberley of Science. "We don't know that ahumanoid can be differentiated from a human at sight. Probably not." Helooked at Lynn. They all did.</p><p>Lynn said heavily, "We in Cheyenne couldn't make one that would pass ashuman in the daylight."</p><p>"But They can," said Macalaster of Security, "and not only physically.We're sure of that. They've advanced mentalic procedures to the pointwhere they can reel off the micro-electronic pattern of the brain andfocus it on the positronic pathways of the robot."</p><p>Lynn stared. "Are you implying that they can create the replica of ahuman being complete with personality and memory?"</p><p>"I do."</p><p>"Of specific human beings?"</p><p>"That's right."</p><p>"Is this also based on Agent Breckenridge's findings?"</p><p>"Yes. The evidence can't be disputed."</p><p>Lynn bent his head in thought for a moment. Then he said, "Then ten menin the United States are not men but humanoids. But the originals wouldhave had to be available to them. They couldn't be Orientals, who wouldbe too easy to spot, so they would have to be East Europeans. How wouldthey be introduced into this country, then? With the radar network overthe entire world border as tight as a drum, how could They introduceany individual, human or humanoid, without our knowing it?"</p><p>Macalaster of Security said, "It can be done. There are certainlegitimate seepages across the border. Businessmen, pilots, eventourists. They're watched, of course, on both sides. Still ten ofthem might have been kidnapped and used as models for humanoids. Thehumanoids would then be sent back in their place. Since we wouldn'texpect such a substitution, it would pass us by. If they were Americansto begin with, there would be no difficulty in their getting into thiscountry. It's as simple as that."</p><p>"And even their friends and family could not tell the difference?"</p><p>"We must assume so. Believe me, we've been waiting for any reportthat might imply sudden attacks of amnesia or troublesome changes inpersonality. We've checked on thousands."</p><p>Amberley of Science stared at his finger-tips. "I think ordinarymeasures won't work. The attack must come from the Bureau of Roboticsand I depend on the chief of that bureau."</p><p>Again eyes turned sharply, expectantly, on Lynn.</p><p>Lynn felt bitterness rise. It seemed to him that this was what theconference came to and was intended for. Nothing that had been said hadnot been said before. He was sure of that. There was no solution tothe problem, no pregnant suggestion. It was a device for the record, adevice on the part of men who gravely feared defeat and who wished theresponsibility for it placed clearly and unequivocally on someone else.</p><p>And yet there was justice in it. It was in robotics that We had fallenshort. And Lynn was not Lynn merely. He was Lynn of Robotics and theresponsibility had to be his.</p><p>He said, "I will do what I can."</p><hr class="tb" /><p>He spent a wakeful night and there was a haggardness about bothbody and soul when he sought and attained another interview withPresidential Assistant Jeffreys the next morning. Breckenridge wasthere, and though Lynn would have preferred a private conference,he could see the justice in the situation. It was obvious thatBreckenridge had attained enormous influence with the government as aresult of his successful Intelligence work. Well, why not?</p><p>Lynn said, "Sir, I am considering the possibility that we are hoppinguselessly to enemy piping."</p><p>"In what way?"</p><p>"I'm sure that however impatient the public may grow at times, andhowever legislators sometimes find it expedient to talk, the governmentat least recognizes the world stalemate to be beneficial. They mustrecognize it also. Ten humanoids with one TC bomb is a trivial way ofbreaking the stalemate."</p><p>"The destruction of fifteen million human beings is scarcely trivial."</p><p>"It is from the world power standpoint. It would not so demoralize usas to make us surrender or so cripple us as to convince us we could notwin. There would just be the same old planetary death-war that bothsides have avoided so long and so successfully. And all They would haveaccomplished is to force us to fight minus one city. It's not enough."</p><p>"What do you suggest?" said Jeffreys, coldly. "That They do not haveten humanoids in our country? That there is not a TC bomb waiting toget together?"</p><p>"I'll agree that those things are here, but perhaps for some reasongreater than just mid-winter bomb-madness."</p><p>"Such as?"</p><p>"It may be that the physical destruction resulting from the humanoidsgetting together is not the worst thing that can happen to us. Whatabout the moral and intellectual destruction that comes of their beinghere at all? With all due respect to Agent Breckenridge, what ifThey <i>intended</i> for us to find out about the humanoids; what if thehumanoids are never supposed to get together, but merely to remainseparate in order to give us something to worry about."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Tell me this. What measures have already been taken against thehumanoids? I suppose that Security is going through the files of allcitizens who have ever been across the border or close enough to itto make kidnapping possible. I know, since Macalaster mentioned ityesterday, that they are following up suspicious psychiatric cases.What else?"</p><p>Jeffreys said, "Small X-ray devices are being installed in key placesin the large cities. In the mass arenas, for instance&mdash;"</p><p>"Where ten humanoids might slip in among a hundred thousand spectatorsof a football game or an air-polo match?"</p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>"And concert halls and churches?"</p><p>"We must start somewhere. We can't do it all at once."</p><p>"Particularly when panic must be avoided?" said Lynn. "Isn't that so?It wouldn't do to have the public realize that at any unpredictablemoment, some unpredictable city and its human contents would suddenlycease to exist."</p><p>"I suppose that's obvious. What are you driving at?"</p><p>Lynn said strenuously, "That a growing fraction of our national effortwill be diverted entirely into the nasty problem of what Amberleycalled finding a very small needle in a very large haystack. We'llbe chasing our tails madly, while They increase their researchlead to the point where we find we can no longer catch up; when wemust surrender without the chance even of snapping our fingers inretaliation.</p><p>"Consider further that this news will leak out as more and more peoplebecome involved in our counter-measures and more and more people beginto guess what we're doing. Then what? The panic might do us more harmthan any one TC bomb."</p><p>The Presidential Assistant said, irritably, "In Heaven's name, man,what do you suggest we do, then?"</p><p>"Nothing," said Lynn. "Call their bluff. Live as we have lived andgamble that They won't dare break the stalemate for the sake of aone-bomb headstart."</p><p>"Impossible!" said Jeffreys. "Completely impossible. The welfare of allof Us is very largely in my hands, and doing nothing is the one thingI cannot do. I agree with you, perhaps, that X-ray machines at sportsarenas are a kind of skin-deep measure that won't be effective, but ithas to be done so that people, in the aftermath, do not come to thebitter conclusion that we tossed our country away for the sake of asubtle line of reasoning that encouraged do-nothingism. In fact, ourcounter-gambit will be active indeed."</p><p>"In what way?"</p><p>Presidential Assistant Jeffreys looked at Breckenridge. The youngSecurity officer, hitherto calmly silent, said, "It's no use talkingabout a possible future break in the stalemate when the stalemate isbroken now. It doesn't matter whether these humanoids explode or donot. Maybe they <i>are</i> only a bait to divert us, as you say. But thefact remains that we are a quarter of a century behind in robotics, andthat may be fatal. What other advances in robotics will there be tosurprise us if war does start? The only answer is to divert our entireforce immediately, <i>now</i>, into a crash program of robotics research,and the first problem is to find the humanoids. Call it an exercisein robotics, if you will, or call it the prevention of the death offifteen million men, women and children."</p><p>Lynn shook his head, helplessly, "You <i>can't</i>. You'd be playing intotheir hands. They want us lured into the one blind alley while they'refree to advance in all other directions."</p><p>Jeffreys said, impatiently, "That's your guess. Breckenridge has madehis suggestion through channels and the government has approved, and wewill begin with an all-Science conference."</p><p>"All-Science?"</p><p>Breckenridge said, "We have listed every important scientist of everybranch of natural science. They'll all be at Cheyenne. There willbe only one point on the agenda: How to advance robotics. The majorspecific sub-heading under that will be: How to develop a receivingdevice for the electromagnetic fields of the cerebral cortex that willbe sufficiently delicate to distinguish between a protoplasmic humanbrain and a positronic humanoid brain."</p><p>Jeffreys said, "We had hoped you would be willing to be in charge ofthe conference."</p><p>"I was not consulted in this."</p><p>"Obviously time was short, sir. Do you agree to be in charge?"</p><p>Lynn smiled briefly. It was a matter of responsibility again. Theresponsibility must be clearly that of Lynn of Robotics. He had thefeeling it would be Breckenridge who would really be in charge. Butwhat could he do?</p><p>He said, "I agree."</p><hr class="tb" /><p>Breckenridge and Lynn returned together to Cheyenne, where that eveningLaszlo listened with a sullen mistrust to Lynn's description of comingevents.</p><p>Laszlo said, "While you were gone, Chief, I've started puttingfive experimental models of humanoid structure through the testingprocedures. Our men are on a twelve-hour day, with three shiftsoverlapping. If we've got to arrange a conference, we're going to becrowded and red-taped out of everything. Work will come to a halt."</p><p>Breckenridge said, "That will be only temporary. You will gain morethan you lose."</p><p>Laszlo scowled. "A bunch of astrophysicists and geochemists aroundwon't help a damn toward robotics."</p><p>"Views from specialists of other fields may be helpful."</p><p>"Are you sure? How do we know that there <i>is</i> any way of detectingbrain waves or that, even if we can, there is a way of differentiatinghuman and humanoid by wave pattern. Who set up the project, anyway?"</p><p>"I did," said Breckenridge.</p><p>"<i>You</i> did? Are you a robotics man?"</p><p>The young Security agent said, calmly, "I have studied robotics."</p><p>"That's not the same thing."</p><p>"I've had access to text-material dealing with Russian robotics&mdash;inRussian. Top-secret material well in advance of anything you have here."</p><p>Lynn said, ruefully, "He has us there, Laszlo."</p><p>"It was on the basis of that material," Breckenridge went on, "thatI suggested this particular line of investigation. It is reasonablycertain that in copying off the electromagnetic pattern of aspecific human mind into a specific positronic brain, a perfectlyexact duplicate cannot be made. For one thing, the most complicatedpositronic brain small enough to fit into a human-sized skull ishundreds of times less complex than the human brain. It can't pickup all the overtones, therefore, and there must be some way to takeadvantage of that fact."</p><p>Laszlo looked impressed despite himself and Lynn smiled grimly. It waseasy to resent Breckenridge and the coming intrusion of several hundredscientists of non-robotics specialties, but the problem itself was anintriguing one. There was that consolation, at least.</p><hr class="tb" /><p>It came to him quietly.</p><p>Lynn found he had nothing to do but sit in his office alone, with anexecutive position that had grown merely titular. Perhaps that helped.It gave him time to think, to picture the creative scientists of halfthe world converging on Cheyenne.</p><p>It was Breckenridge who, with cool efficiency, was handling the detailsof preparation. There had been a kind of confidence in the way he said,"Let's get together and we'll lick Them."</p><p>Let's get together.</p><p>It came to Lynn so quietly that anyone watching Lynn at that momentmight have seen his eyes blink slowly twice&mdash;but surely nothing more.</p><p>He did what he had to do with a whirling detachment that kept him calmwhen he felt that, by all rights, he ought to be going mad.</p><p>He sought out Breckenridge in the other's improvised quarters.</p><p>Breckenridge was alone and frowning. "Is anything wrong, sir?"</p><p>Lynn said, wearily, "Everything's right, I think. I've invoked martiallaw."</p><p>"What!"</p><p>"As chief of a division I can do so if I am of the opinion thesituation warrants it. Over my division, I can then be dictator. Chalkup one for the beauties of decentralization."</p><p>"You will rescind that order immediately." Breckenridge took a stepforward. "When Washington hears this, you will be ruined."</p><p>"I'm ruined anyway. Do you think I don't realize that I've been set upfor the role of the greatest villain in American history: the man wholet Them break the stalemate. I have nothing to lose&mdash;and perhaps agreat deal to gain."</p><p>He laughed a little wildly, "What a target the Division of Roboticswill be, eh, Breckenridge? Only a few thousand men to be killed bya TC bomb capable of wiping out three hundred square miles in onemicro-second. But five hundred of those men would be our greatestscientists. We would be in the peculiar position of having to fight awar with our brains shot out, or surrendering. I think we'd surrender."</p><p>"But this is impossible. Lynn, do you hear me? Do you understand? Howcould the humanoids pass our security provisions? How could they gettogether?"</p><p>"But they <i>are</i> getting together! We're helping them to do so.We're ordering them to do so. Our scientists visit the other side,Breckenridge. They visit Them regularly. You made a point of howstrange it was that no one in robotics did. Well, ten of thosescientists are still there and in their place, ten humanoids areconverging on Cheyenne."</p><p>"That's a ridiculous guess."</p><p>"I think it's a good one, Breckenridge. But it wouldn't work unless weknew humanoids were in America so that we would call the conference inthe first place. Quite a coincidence that you brought the news of thehumanoids <i>and</i> suggested the conference <i>and</i> suggested the agenda<i>and</i> are running the show and know exactly which scientists wereinvited. Did you make sure the right ten were included?"</p><p>"Dr. Lynn!" cried Breckenridge in outrage. He poised to rush forward.</p><p>Lynn said, "Don't move. I've got a blaster here. We'll just wait forthe scientists to get here one by one. One by one we'll X-ray them. Oneby one, we'll monitor them for radioactivity. No two will get togetherwithout being checked, and if all five hundred are clear, I'll giveyou my blaster and surrender to you. Only I think we'll find the tenhumanoids. Sit down, Breckenridge."</p><p>They both sat.</p><p>Lynn said, "We wait. When I'm tired, Laszlo will spell me. We wait."</p><hr class="tb" /><p>Professor Manuelo Jiminez of the Institute of Higher Studies of BuenosAires exploded while the stratospheric jet on which he traveled wasthree miles above the Amazon Valley. It was a simple chemical explosionbut it was enough to destroy the plane.</p><p>Dr. Herman Liebowitz of M. I. T. exploded in a monorail, killing twentypeople and injuring a hundred others.</p><p>In similar manner, Dr. Auguste Marin of L'Institut Nucléonique ofMontreal and seven others died at various stages of their journey toCheyenne.</p><hr class="tb" /><p>Laszlo hurtled in, pale-faced and stammering, with the first newsof it. It had only been two hours that Lynn had sat there, facingBreckenridge, blaster in hand.</p><p>Laszlo said, "I thought you were nuts, Chief, but you were right.They <i>were</i> humanoids. They <i>had</i> to be." He turned to stare withhate-filled eyes at Breckenridge. "Only they were warned. <i>He</i> warnedthem, and now there won't be one left intact. Not one to study."</p><p>"God!" cried Lynn and in a frenzy of haste thrust his blaster outtoward Breckenridge and fired. The Security man's neck vanished; thetorso fell; the head dropped, thudded against the floor and rolledcrookedly.</p><p>Lynn moaned, "I didn't understand, I thought he was a traitor. Nothingmore."</p><p>And Laszlo stood immobile, mouth open, for the moment incapable ofspeech.</p><p>Lynn said, wildly. "Sure, he warned them. But how could he do so whilesitting in that chair unless he were equipped with built-in radiotransmission? Don't you see it? Breckenridge had been in Moscow. Thereal Breckenridge is still there. Oh my God, there were <i>eleven</i> ofthem."</p><p>Laszlo managed a hoarse squeak. "Why didn't <i>he</i> explode?"</p><p>"He was hanging on, I suppose, to make sure the others had received hismessage and were safely destroyed. Lord, Lord, when you brought thenews and I realized the truth, I couldn't shoot fast enough. God knowsby how few seconds I may have beaten him to it."</p><p>Laszlo said, shakily, "At least, we'll have one to study." He bentand put his fingers on the sticky fluid trickling out of the mangledremains at the neck end of the headless body.</p><p>Not blood, but high-grade machine oil.</p><div style='display:block; margin-top:4em'>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LET&#039;S GET TOGETHER ***</div><div style='text-align:left'><div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>Updated editions will replace the previous one&#8212;the old editions willbe renamed.</div><div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyrightlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the UnitedStates without permission and without paying copyrightroyalties.
