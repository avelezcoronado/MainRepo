A yellow dressinggown, ungirdled,was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He held the bowl aloftand intoned:</p><p>&mdash;<i>Introibo ad altare Dei</i>.</p><p>Halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:</p><p>&mdash;Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!</p><p>Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about andblessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awakingmountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him andmade rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head.Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of thestaircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him,equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued likepale oak.</p><p>Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowlsmartly.</p><p>&mdash;Back to barracks! he said sternly.</p><p>He added in a preacher’s tone:</p><p>&mdash;For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul andblood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A littletrouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.</p><p>He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused awhilein rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there with goldpoints. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm.</p><p>&mdash;Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off thecurrent, will you?</p><p>He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering abouthis legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and sullen ovaljowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages. A pleasant smilebroke quietly over his lips.</p><p>&mdash;The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!</p><p>He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet, laughingto himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily halfway and satdown on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as he propped his mirror onthe parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck.</p><p>Buck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.</p><p>&mdash;My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has aHellenic ring, hasn’t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We must goto Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid?</p><p>He laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:</p><p>&mdash;Will he come? The jejune jesuit!</p><p>Ceasing, he began to shave with care.</p><p>&mdash;Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, my love?</p><p>&mdash;How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?</p><p>Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.</p><p>&mdash;God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinksyou’re not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money andindigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you have the realOxford manner. He can’t make you out. O, my name for you is the best: Kinch,the knife-blade.</p><p>He shaved warily over his chin.</p><p>&mdash;He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where ishis guncase?</p><p>&mdash;A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?</p><p>&mdash;I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the darkwith a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a blackpanther. You saved men from drowning. I’m not a hero, however. If he stays onhere I am off.</p><p>Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down from hisperch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.</p><p>&mdash;Scutter! he cried thickly.</p><p>He came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper pocket,said:</p><p>&mdash;Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.</p><p>Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirtycrumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly. Then, gazingover the handkerchief, he said:</p><p>&mdash;The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen. Youcan almost taste it, can’t you?</p><p>He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpalehair stirring slightly.</p><p>&mdash;God! he said quietly. Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweetmother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. <i>Epi oinopa ponton</i>.Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in the original.<i>Thalatta! Thalatta!</i> She is our great sweet mother. Come and look.</p><p>Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked down onthe water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown.</p><p>&mdash;Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.</p><p>He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s face.</p><p>&mdash;The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That’s why she won’tlet me have anything to do with you.</p><p>&mdash;Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.</p><p>&mdash;You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother askedyou, Buck Mulligan said. I’m hyperborean as much as you. But to think of yourmother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her. And yourefused. There is something sinister in you....</p><p>He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant smilecurled his lips.</p><p>&mdash;But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest mummerof them all!</p><p>He shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.</p><p>Stephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against hisbrow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve. Pain, thatwas not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in a dream she hadcome to him after her death, her wasted body within its loose browngraveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, that had bentupon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of wetted ashes. Across thethreadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by thewellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass ofliquid. A bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the greensluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loudgroaning vomiting.</p><p>Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.</p><p>&mdash;Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt anda few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?</p><p>&mdash;They fit well enough, Stephen answered.</p><p>Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.</p><p>&mdash;The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. Godknows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe,grey. You’ll look spiffing in them. I’m not joking, Kinch. You look damn wellwhen you’re dressed.</p><p>&mdash;Thanks, Stephen said. I can’t wear them if they are grey.</p><p>&mdash;He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror. Etiquetteis etiquette. He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey trousers.</p><p>He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smoothskin.</p><p>Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokebluemobile eyes.</p><p>&mdash;That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, saysyou have g. p. i. He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. General paralysisof the insane!</p><p>He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad insunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and the edgesof his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk.</p><p>&mdash;Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!</p><p>Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by acrooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this face forme? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.</p><p>&mdash;I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does herall right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead himnot into temptation. And her name is Ursula.</p><p>Laughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.</p><p>&mdash;The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. IfWilde were only alive to see you!</p><p>Drawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:</p><p>&mdash;It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.</p><p>Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him roundthe tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrustthem.</p><p>&mdash;It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly. Godknows you have more spirit than any of them.</p><p>Parried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The coldsteel pen.</p><p>&mdash;Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairsand touch him for a guinea. He’s stinking with money and thinks you’re not agentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloodyswindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I could only work together we might dosomething for the island. Hellenise it.</p><p>Cranly’s arm. His arm.</p><p>&mdash;And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I’m the only onethat knows what you are. Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up yournose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll bring downSeymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe.</p><p>Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms. Palefaces: theyhold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall expire! Breakthe news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit ribbons of his shirtwhipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table, with trousers down atheels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor’s shears. A scared calf’sface gilded with marmalade. I don’t want to be debagged! Don’t you play thegiddy ox with me!</p><p>Shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deafgardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower on thesombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.</p><p>To ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.</p><p>&mdash;Let him stay, Stephen said. There’s nothing wrong with him except atnight.</p><p>&mdash;Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I’m quitefrank with you. What have you against me now?</p><p>They halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the waterlike the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.</p><p>&mdash;Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don’t remember anything.</p><p>He looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow, fanningsoftly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in hiseyes.</p><p>Stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:</p><p>&mdash;Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’sdeath?</p><p>Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:</p><p>&mdash;What? Where? I can’t remember anything. I remember only ideas andsensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?</p><p>&mdash;You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to getmore hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom. Sheasked you who was in your room.</p><p>&mdash;Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.</p><p>&mdash;You said, Stephen answered, <i>O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother isbeastly dead.</i></p><p>A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan’scheek.</p><p>&mdash;Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?</p><p>He shook his constraint from him nervously.</p><p>&mdash;And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You sawonly your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmondand cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It’s a beastly thing and nothingelse. It simply doesn’t matter. You wouldn’t kneel down to pray for your motheron her deathbed when she asked you. Why? Because you have the cursed jesuitstrain in you, only it’s injected the wrong way. To me it’s all a mockery andbeastly. Her cerebral lobes are not functioning. She calls the doctor sir PeterTeazle and picks buttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it’s over. Youcrossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whingelike some hired mute from Lalouette’s. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I didn’tmean to offend the memory of your mother.</p><p>He had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping wounds whichthe words had left in his heart, said very coldly:</p><p>&mdash;I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.</p><p>&mdash;Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.</p><p>&mdash;Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.</p><p>Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel.</p><p>&mdash;O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.</p><p>He walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post, gazing overthe calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew dim. Pulses werebeating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt the fever of his cheeks.</p><p>A voice within the tower called loudly:</p><p>&mdash;Are you up there, Mulligan?</p><p>&mdash;I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.</p><p>He turned towards Stephen and said:</p><p>&mdash;Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch,and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.</p><p>His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level with theroof:</p><p>&mdash;Don’t mope over it all day, he said. I’m inconsequent. Give up the moodybrooding.</p><p>His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of thestairhead:</p><p class="poem">And no more turn aside and brood<br/>Upon love’s bitter mystery<br/>For Fergus rules the brazen cars.</p><p>Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairheadseaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened,spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the dim sea. The twiningstresses, two by two. A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twiningchords. Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.</p><p>A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in deepergreen. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus’ song: I sang italone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her door was open: shewanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside. Shewas crying in her wretched bed. For those words, Stephen: love’s bittermystery.</p><p>Where now?</p><p>Her secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk, a gaudof amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny window of herhouse when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turkothe Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:</p><p class="poem">I am the boy<br/>That can enjoy<br/>Invisibility.</p><p>Phantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.</p><p class="poem">And no more turn aside and brood.</p><p>Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his broodingbrain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached thesacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar, roasting for her at the hobon a dark autumn evening. Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood ofsquashed lice from the children’s shirts.</p><p>In a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its loosegraveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath, bent over himwith mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.</p><p>Her glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me alone.The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured face. Herhoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on their knees. Hereyes on me to strike me down. <i>Liliata rutilantium te confessorum turmacircumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat.</i></p><p>Ghoul! Chewer of corpses!</p><p>No, mother! Let me be and let me live.</p><p>&mdash;Kinch ahoy!</p><p>Buck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up thestaircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry, heardwarm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.</p><p>&mdash;Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines isapologising for waking us last night. It’s all right.</p><p>&mdash;I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.</p><p>&mdash;Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all oursakes.</p><p>His head disappeared and reappeared.</p><p>&mdash;I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it’s very clever. Touch himfor a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.</p><p>&mdash;I get paid this morning, Stephen said.</p><p>&mdash;The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.</p><p>&mdash;If you want it, Stephen said.</p><p>&mdash;Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We’ll have aglorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent sovereigns.</p><p>He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of tunewith a Cockney accent:</p><p class="poem">O, won’t we have a merry time,<br/>Drinking whisky, beer and wine!<br/>On coronation,<br/>Coronation day!<br/>O, won’t we have a merry time<br/>On coronation day!</p><p>Warm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone, forgotten,on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there all day,forgotten friendship?</p><p>He went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness, smellingthe clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck. So I carried theboat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and yet the same. A servanttoo. A server of a servant.</p><p>In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form movedbriskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its yellow glow. Twoshafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans:and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried greasefloated, turning.</p><p>&mdash;We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?</p><p>Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the hammockwhere it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors.</p><p>&mdash;Have you the key? a voice asked.</p><p>&mdash;Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I’m choked!</p><p>He howled, without looking up from the fire:</p><p>&mdash;Kinch!</p><p>&mdash;It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.</p><p>The key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been set ajar,welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the doorway, looking out.Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait. BuckMulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him. Then he carried the dish anda large teapot over to the table, set them down heavily and sighed with relief.</p><p>&mdash;I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not aword more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines, comein. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts. Where’s thesugar? O, jay, there’s no milk.</p><p>Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from thelocker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.</p><p>&mdash;What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.</p><p>&mdash;We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There’s a lemon in thelocker.</p><p>&mdash;O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycovemilk.</p><p>Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:</p><p>&mdash;That woman is coming up with the milk.</p><p>&mdash;The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from hischair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here, I can’tgo fumbling at the damned eggs.</p><p>He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates,saying:</p><p>&mdash;<i>In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.</i></p><p>Haines sat down to pour out the tea.</p><p>&mdash;I’m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you domake strong tea, don’t you?</p><p>Buck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’swheedling voice:</p><p>&mdash;When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when Imakes water I makes water.</p><p>&mdash;By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.</p><p>Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:</p><p>&mdash;<i>So I do, Mrs Cahill,</i> says she. <i>Begob, ma’am,</i> says MrsCahill, <i>God send you don’t make them in the one pot.</i></p><p>He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled on hisknife.</p><p>&mdash;That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five linesof text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum.Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.</p><p>He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his brows:</p><p>&mdash;Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken ofin the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?</p><p>&mdash;I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.</p><p>&mdash;Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?</p><p>&mdash;I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of theMabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.</p><p>Buck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.</p><p>&mdash;Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth andblinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!</p><p>Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened raspingvoice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:</p><p><i>&mdash;For old Mary Ann<br/>She doesn’t care a damn.<br/>But, hising up her petticoats...</i></p><p>He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.</p><p>The doorway was darkened by an entering form.</p><p>&mdash;The milk, sir!</p><p>&mdash;Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.</p><p>An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.</p><p>&mdash;That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.</p><p>&mdash;To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!</p><p>Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.</p><p>&mdash;The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of thecollector of prepuces.</p><p>&mdash;How much, sir? asked the old woman.</p><p>&mdash;A quart, Stephen said.</p><p>He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk,not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a tilly. Old andsecret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a messenger. She praised thegoodness of the milk, pouring it out. Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak inthe lush field, a witch on her toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at thesquirting dugs. They lowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk ofthe kine and poor old woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone,lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, theircommon cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid,whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.</p><p>&mdash;It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.</p><p>&mdash;Taste it, sir, she said.</p><p>He drank at her bidding.</p><p>&mdash;If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat loudly,we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts. Living in abogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust, horsedung andconsumptives’ spits.</p><p>&mdash;Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.</p><p>&mdash;I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.</p><p>&mdash;Look at that now, she said.</p><p>Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice thatspeaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights. To thevoice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but herwoman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in God’s likeness, the serpent’sprey. And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteadyeyes.</p><p>&mdash;Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.</p><p>&mdash;Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.</p><p>Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.</p><p>&mdash;Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?</p><p>&mdash;I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from thewest, sir?</p><p>&mdash;I am an Englishman, Haines answered.</p><p>&mdash;He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irishin Ireland.</p><p>&mdash;Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak thelanguage myself. I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.</p><p>&mdash;Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill usout some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma’am?</p><p>&mdash;No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the milkcanon her forearm and about to go.</p><p>Haines said to her:</p><p>&mdash;Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?</p><p>Stephen filled again the three cups.</p><p>&mdash;Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint attwopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three morningsa quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That’s a shilling and oneand two is two and two, sir.</p><p>Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly butteredon both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouserpockets.</p><p>&mdash;Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.</p><p>Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick richmilk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in his fingers andcried:</p><p>&mdash;A miracle!</p><p>He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:</p><p>&mdash;Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.</p><p>Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.</p><p>&mdash;We’ll owe twopence, he said.</p><p>&mdash;Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning,sir.</p><p>She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:</p><p><i>&mdash;Heart of my heart, were it more,<br/>More would be laid at your feet.</i></p><p>He turned to Stephen and said:</p><p>&mdash;Seriously, Dedalus. I’m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring usback some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland expects thatevery man this day will do his duty.</p><p>&mdash;That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your nationallibrary today.</p><p>&mdash;Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.</p><p>He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:</p><p>&mdash;Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?</p><p>Then he said to Haines:</p><p>&mdash;The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.</p><p>&mdash;All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honeytrickle over a slice of the loaf.</p><p>Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loosecollar of his tennis shirt spoke:</p><p>&mdash;I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.</p><p>Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit. Conscience. Yethere’s a spot.</p><p>&mdash;That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol ofIrish art is deuced good.</p><p>Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth oftone:</p><p>&mdash;Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.</p><p>&mdash;Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was justthinking of it when that poor old creature came in.</p><p>&mdash;Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.</p><p>Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of thehammock, said:</p><p>&mdash;I don’t know, I’m sure.</p><p>He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and saidwith coarse vigour:</p><p>&mdash;You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?</p><p>&mdash;Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From themilkwoman or from him. It’s a toss up, I think.</p><p>&mdash;I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come alongwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.</p><p>&mdash;I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.</p><p>Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.</p><p>&mdash;From me, Kinch, he said.</p><p>In a suddenly changed tone he added:</p><p>&mdash;To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. Damn all else they aregood for. Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all. Let us getout of the kip.</p><p>He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, sayingresignedly:</p><p>&mdash;Mulligan is stripped of his garments.</p><p>He emptied his pockets on to the table.</p><p>&mdash;There’s your snotrag, he said.</p><p>And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them, chidingthem, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and rummaged in histrunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God, we’ll simply have to dressthe character. I want puce gloves and green boots. Contradiction. Do Icontradict myself? Very well then, I contradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. Alimp black missile flew out of his talking hands.</p><p>&mdash;And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.</p><p>Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the doorway:</p><p>&mdash;Are you coming, you fellows?</p><p>&mdash;I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out with gravewords and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:</p><p>&mdash;And going forth he met Butterly.</p><p>Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out and, asthey went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and locked it. He putthe huge key in his inner pocket.</p><p>At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:</p><p>&mdash;Did you bring the key?</p><p>&mdash;I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.</p><p>He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowelthe leader shoots of ferns or grasses.</p><p>&mdash;Down, sir! How dare you, sir!</p><p>Haines asked:</p><p>&mdash;Do you pay rent for this tower?</p><p>&mdash;Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.</p><p>&mdash;To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.</p><p>They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:</p><p>&mdash;Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?</p><p>&mdash;Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were onthe sea. But ours is the <i>omphalos</i>.</p><p>&mdash;What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.</p><p>&mdash;No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinasand the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I have a fewpints in me first.</p><p>He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of hisprimrose waistcoat:</p><p>&mdash;You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?</p><p>&mdash;It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.</p><p>&mdash;You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?</p><p>&mdash;Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. It’squite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is Shakespeare’sgrandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.</p><p>&mdash;What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?</p><p>Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in looselaughter, said to Stephen’s ear:</p><p>&mdash;O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!</p><p>&mdash;We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it israther long to tell.</p><p>Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.</p><p>&mdash;The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.</p><p>&mdash;I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this towerand these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. <i>That beetles o’er hisbase into the sea,</i> isn’t it?</p><p>Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak.In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourningbetween their gay attires.</p><p>&mdash;It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.</p><p>Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent. Theseas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume ofthe mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins.</p><p>&mdash;I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.</p><p>Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at them,his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenlywithdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a doll’s head toand fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiethappy foolish voice:</p><p><i>&mdash;I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.<br/>My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.<br/>With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.<br/>So here’s to disciples and Calvary.</i></p><p>He held up a forefinger of warning.</p><p><i>&mdash;If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine<br/>He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine<br/>But have to drink water and wish it were plain<br/>That I make when the wine becomes water again.</i></p><p>He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward to abrow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of oneabout to rise in the air, and chanted:</p><p><i>&mdash;Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said<br/>And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.<br/>What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly<br/>And Olivet’s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!</i></p><p>He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his winglikehands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore backto them his brief birdsweet cries.</p><p>Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and said:</p><p>&mdash;We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. He’s rather blasphemous. I’m not abeliever myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of itsomehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?</p><p>&mdash;The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.</p><p>&mdash;O, Haines said, you have heard it before?</p><p>&mdash;Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.</p><p>&mdash;You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in thenarrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a personalGod.</p><p>&mdash;There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.</p><p>Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a greenstone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.</p><p>&mdash;Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.</p><p>Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his sidepocketand took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang it open too, and,having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shellof his hands.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe oryou don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a personal God.You don’t stand for that, I suppose?</p><p>&mdash;You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible exampleof free thought.</p><p>He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his side. Itsferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels. My familiar,after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line along the path. Theywill walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark. He wants that key. It ismine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt bread. Give him the key too. All. Hewill ask for it. That was in his eyes.</p><p>&mdash;After all, Haines began...</p><p>Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not allunkind.</p><p>&mdash;After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are yourown master, it seems to me.</p><p>&mdash;I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.</p><p>&mdash;Italian? Haines said.</p><p>A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.</p><p>&mdash;And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.</p><p>&mdash;Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?</p><p>&mdash;The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and theholy Roman catholic and apostolic church.</p><p>Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke.</p><p>&mdash;I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think likethat, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.It seems history is to blame.</p><p>The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of theirbrazen bells: <i>et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:</i> theslow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts, achemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus, thevoices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and behind their chant thevigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. Ahorde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers ofwhom Mulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon theconsubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ’sterrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that theFather was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since inmockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void awaits surely all them thatweave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattledangels of the church, Michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour ofconflict with their lances and their shields.</p><p>Hear, hear! Prolonged applause. <i>Zut! Nom de Dieu!</i></p><p>&mdash;Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one. Idon’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. That’sour national problem, I’m afraid, just now.</p><p>Two men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.</p><p>&mdash;She’s making for Bullock harbour.</p><p>The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.</p><p>&mdash;There’s five fathoms out there, he said. It’ll be swept up that way whenthe tide comes in about one. It’s nine days today.</p><p>The man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for aswollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face, saltwhite. Here Iam.</p><p>They followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on astone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder. A youngman clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise his green legsin the deep jelly of the water.</p><p>&mdash;Is the brother with you, Malachi?</p><p>&mdash;Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.</p><p>&mdash;Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young thingdown there. Photo girl he calls her.</p><p>&mdash;Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.</p><p>Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near thespur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones, waterglistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water rilling over hischest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth.</p><p>Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines andStephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips andbreastbone.</p><p>&mdash;Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur ofrock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.</p><p>&mdash;Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.</p><p>&mdash;Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?</p><p>&mdash;Yes.</p><p>&mdash;Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto withmoney.</p><p>&mdash;Is she up the pole?</p><p>&mdash;Better ask Seymour that.</p><p>&mdash;Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.</p><p>He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying tritely:</p><p>&mdash;Redheaded women buck like goats.</p><p>He broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.</p><p>&mdash;My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I’m the <i>Übermensch.</i> ToothlessKinch and I, the supermen.</p><p>He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay.</p><p>&mdash;Are you going in here, Malachi?</p><p>&mdash;Yes. Make room in the bed.</p><p>The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middleof the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a stone, smoking.</p><p>&mdash;Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.</p><p>&mdash;Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.</p><p>Stephen turned away.</p><p>&mdash;I’m going, Mulligan, he said.</p><p>&mdash;Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.</p><p>Stephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes.</p><p>&mdash;And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.</p><p>Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck Mulliganerect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:</p><p>&mdash;He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spakeZarathustra.</p><p>His plump body plunged.</p><p>&mdash;We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the pathand smiling at wild Irish.</p><p>Horn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.</p><p>&mdash;The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.</p><p>&mdash;Good, Stephen said.</p><p>He walked along the upwardcurving path.</p><p class="poem">Liliata rutilantium.<br/>Turma circumdet.<br/>Iubilantium te virginum.</p><p>The priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will notsleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.</p><p>A voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning thecurve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a seal’s, far outon the water, round.</p><p>Usurper.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="chap02"></a>[ 2 ]</h3><p>&mdash;You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?</p><p>&mdash;Tarentum, sir.</p><p>&mdash;Very good.

And yet it was in some way if not as memoryfabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings of excess.

C.</p><p>&mdash;Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarredbook.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, sir. And he said: <i>Another victory like that and we are donefor.</i></p><p>That phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a hillabove a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers, leaned upon hisspear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.</p><p>&mdash;You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?</p><p>&mdash;End of Pyrrhus, sir?</p><p>&mdash;I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.</p><p>&mdash;Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?</p><p>A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel. He curled them between hispalms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to the tissue of hislips. A sweetened boy’s breath. Welloff people, proud that their eldest son wasin the navy. Vico Road, Dalkey.</p><p>&mdash;Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.</p><p>All laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round at hisclassmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh more loudly,aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.</p><p>&mdash;Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book, whatis a pier.</p><p>&mdash;A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of abridge. Kingstown pier, sir.</p><p>Some laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back benchwhispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent. All. Withenvy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their likes: theirbreaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets tittering in thestruggle.</p><p>&mdash;Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.</p><p>The words troubled their gaze.</p><p>&mdash;How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.</p><p>For Haines’s chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild drink andtalk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A jester at the courtof his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a clement master’s praise. Whyhad they chosen all that part? Not wholly for the smooth caress. For them toohistory was a tale like any other too often heard, their land a pawnshop.</p><p>Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not beenknifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has branded them andfettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they haveousted. But can those have been possible seeing that they never were? Or wasthat only possible which came to pass? Weave, weaver of the wind.</p><p>&mdash;Tell us a story, sir.</p><p>&mdash;O, do, sir. A ghoststory.</p><p>&mdash;Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Weep no more,</i> Comyn said.</p><p>&mdash;Go on then, Talbot.</p><p>&mdash;And the story, sir?</p><p>&mdash;After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.</p><p>A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of hissatchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:</p><p><i>&mdash;Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more<br/>For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,<br/>Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor...</i></p><p>It must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.Aristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out intothe studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read,sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow a delicateSiamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains about me: underglowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and in my mind’s darkness asloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragonscaly folds. Thought is the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soulis in a manner all that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden,vast, candescent: form of forms.</p><p>Talbot repeated:</p><p><i>&mdash;Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,<br/>Through the dear might...</i></p><p>&mdash;Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don’t see anything.</p><p>&mdash;What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.</p><p>His hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having justremembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these craven heartshis shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and on mine. It lies upontheir eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute. To Caesar what isCaesar’s, to God what is God’s. A long look from dark eyes, a riddling sentenceto be woven and woven on the church’s looms.

Stephen asked.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.</p><p>&mdash;Half day, sir. Thursday.</p><p>&mdash;Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.</p><p>They bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling. Crowdingtogether they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling gaily:</p><p>&mdash;A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.</p><p>&mdash;O, ask me, sir.</p><p>&mdash;A hard one, sir.</p><p>&mdash;This is the riddle, Stephen said:</p><p class="poem">The cock crew,<br/>The sky was blue:<br/>The bells in heaven<br/>Were striking eleven.<br/>’Tis time for this poor soul<br/>To go to heaven.</p><p>What is that?</p><p>&mdash;What, sir?</p><p>&mdash;Again, sir. We didn’t hear.</p><p>Their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence Cochranesaid:</p><p>&mdash;What is it, sir? We give it up.</p><p>Stephen, his throat itching, answered:</p><p>&mdash;The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.</p><p>He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoeddismay.</p><p>A stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:</p><p>&mdash;Hockey!</p><p>They broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly theywere gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour oftheir boots and tongues.</p><p>Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open copybook.His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through hismisty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his cheek, dull and bloodless, asoft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent and damp as a snail’s bed.</p><p>He held out his copybook. The word <i>Sums</i> was written on the headline.Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blindloops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.</p><p>&mdash;Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them toyou, sir.</p><p>Stephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.</p><p>&mdash;Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.</p><p>&mdash;Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to copythem off the board, sir.</p><p>&mdash;Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.</p><p>&mdash;No, sir.</p><p>Ugly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a snail’s bed.Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in her heart. But for herthe race of the world would have trampled him underfoot, a squashed bonelesssnail. She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own. Was that thenreal? The only true thing in life? His mother’s prostrate body the fieryColumbanus in holy zeal bestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of atwig burnt in the fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had savedhim from being trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poorsoul gone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek ofrapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth, listened,scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.</p><p>Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by algebra thatShakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather. Sargent peered askance through hisslanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the hollow knock of aball and calls from the field.</p><p>Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of theirletters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands, traverse, bow topartner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from the world, Averroes andMoses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement, flashing in their mockingmirrors the obscure soul of the world, a darkness shining in brightness whichbrightness could not comprehend.</p><p>&mdash;Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?</p><p>&mdash;Yes, sir.</p><p>In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word ofhelp his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue of shameflickering behind his dull skin. <i>Amor matris:</i> subjective and objectivegenitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid fromsight of others his swaddling bands.</p><p>Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My childhood bendsbeside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly. Mine is far andhis secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony sit in the dark palaces of bothour hearts: secrets weary of their tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.</p><p>The sum was done.</p><p>&mdash;It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.</p><p>He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybookback to his bench.</p><p>&mdash;You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said ashe followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, sir.</p><p>In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.</p><p>&mdash;Sargent!</p><p>&mdash;Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.</p><p>He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy fieldwhere sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy cameaway stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When he had reached theschoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He turned his angry whitemoustache.</p><p>&mdash;What is it now? he cried continually without listening.</p><p>&mdash;Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.</p><p>&mdash;Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restoreorder here.</p><p>And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice criedsternly:</p><p>&mdash;What is the matter? What is it now?</p><p>Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed roundhim, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.</p><p>Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of itschairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. As it was in thebeginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins, base treasure ofa bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded,the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles: world without end.</p><p>A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his raremoustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.</p><p>&mdash;First, our little financial settlement, he said.</p><p>He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It slappedopen and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and laid themcarefully on the table.</p><p>&mdash;Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.</p><p>And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved over theshells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money cowries and leopardshells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and this, the scallop of saintJames. An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead treasure, hollow shells.</p><p>A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.</p><p>&mdash;Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is forshillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.</p><p>He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.</p><p>&mdash;Three twelve, he said. I think you’ll find that’s right.</p><p>&mdash;Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shyhaste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.</p><p>&mdash;No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.</p><p>Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too ofbeauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and misery.</p><p>&mdash;Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You’ll pull it out somewhereand lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You’ll find them very handy.</p><p>Answer something.</p><p>&mdash;Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.</p><p>The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times now. Threenooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant if I will.</p><p>&mdash;Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don’tknow yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as I have.I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say? <i>Put butmoney in thy purse.</i></p><p>&mdash;Iago, Stephen murmured.</p><p>He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare.</p><p>&mdash;He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, butan Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you knowwhat is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s mouth?</p><p>The seas’ ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems history isto blame: on me and on my words, unhating.</p><p>&mdash;That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.</p><p>&mdash;Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That’s not English. A French Celt said that. Hetapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.</p><p>&mdash;I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. <i>I paidmy way.</i></p><p>Good man, good man.</p><p><i>&mdash;I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life.</i> Can youfeel that? <i>I owe nothing.</i> Can you?</p><p>Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties. Curran,ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings. Temple, two lunches.Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob Reynolds, half a guinea,Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five weeks’ board. The lump I have isuseless.</p><p>&mdash;For the moment, no, Stephen answered.</p><p>Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.</p><p>&mdash;I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it. Weare a generous people but we must also be just.</p><p>&mdash;I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.</p><p>Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapelybulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of Wales.</p><p>&mdash;You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said. Isaw three generations since O’Connell’s time. I remember the famine in ’46. Doyou know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty yearsbefore O’Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him asa demagogue? You fenians forget some things.</p><p>Glorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh thesplendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, theplanters’ covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie down.</p><p>Stephen sketched a brief gesture.</p><p>&mdash;I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But Iam descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are all Irish,all kings’ sons.</p><p>&mdash;Alas, Stephen said.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Per vias rectas</i>, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He votedfor it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to doso.</p><p class="poem">Lal the ral the ra<br/>The rocky road to Dublin.</p><p>A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John! Soft day,your honour!... Day!... Day!... Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin. Lal theral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.</p><p>&mdash;That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus, withsome of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press. Sit down amoment. I have just to copy the end.</p><p>He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read offsome words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.</p><p>&mdash;Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, <i>the dictates ofcommon sense.</i> Just a moment.</p><p>He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and,muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly, sometimesblowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.</p><p>Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed aroundthe walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek heads poised inair: lord Hastings’ <i>Repulse</i>, the duke of Westminster’s <i>Shotover</i>,the duke of Beaufort’s <i>Ceylon</i>, <i>prix de Paris</i>, 1866. Elfin riderssat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds, backing king’s colours, andshouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.</p><p>&mdash;Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. <i>But prompt ventilation of thisallimportant question...</i></p><p>Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among themudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of thecanteen, over the motley slush. Even money <i>Fair Rebel.</i> Ten to one thefield. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the vying capsand jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher’s dame, nuzzling thirstilyher clove of orange.</p><p>Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle.</p><p>Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, thejoust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems to beslightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock. Jousts, slushand uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout ofspearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts.</p><p>&mdash;Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.</p><p>He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.</p><p>&mdash;I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It’s about thefoot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two opinions onthe matter.</p><p>May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of <i>laissez faire</i>which so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our oldindustries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme. Europeanconflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of the channel. Thepluterperfect imperturbability of the department of agriculture. Pardoned aclassical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who was no better than she should be.To come to the point at issue.</p><p>&mdash;I don’t mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.</p><p>Foot and mouth disease.

Thanking you for the hospitality of yourcolumns.</p><p>&mdash;I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at thenext outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can be cured. Itis cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is regularly treated andcured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They offer to come over here. I amtrying to work up influence with the department. Now I’m going to trypublicity. I am surrounded by difficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairsinfluence by...</p><p>He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.</p><p>&mdash;Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the jews.In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are the signs of anation’s decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nation’s vital strength. Ihave seen it coming these years. As sure as we are standing here the jewmerchants are already at their work of destruction. Old England is dying.</p><p>He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broadsunbeam. He faced about and back again.</p><p>&mdash;Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.</p><p class="poem">The harlot’s cry from street to street<br/>Shall weave old England’s windingsheet.</p><p>His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which hehalted.</p><p>&mdash;A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew orgentile, is he not?</p><p>&mdash;They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can seethe darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the earth tothis day.</p><p>On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices ontheir gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud, uncouth about thetemple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats. Not theirs: theseclothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full slow eyes belied the words,the gestures eager and unoffending, but knew the rancours massed about them andknew their zeal was vain. Vain patience to heap and hoard. Time surely wouldscatter all. A hoard heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Theireyes knew their years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of theirflesh.</p><p>&mdash;Who has not? Stephen said.</p><p>&mdash;What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.</p><p>He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell sideways openuncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.</p><p>&mdash;History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.</p><p>From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal. What ifthat nightmare gave you a back kick?</p><p>&mdash;The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All humanhistory moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.</p><p>Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:</p><p>&mdash;That is God.</p><p>Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!</p><p>&mdash;What? Mr Deasy asked.</p><p>&mdash;A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked betweenhis fingers. Looking up again he set them free.</p><p>&mdash;I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors andmany sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no betterthan she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten years the Greeksmade war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shorehere, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman, O’Rourke, prince of Breffni. A womantoo brought Parnell low. Many errors, many failures but not the one sin. I am astruggler now at the end of my days. But I will fight for the right till theend.</p><p class="poem">For Ulster will fight<br/>And Ulster will be right.</p><p>Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.</p><p>&mdash;Well, sir, he began.</p><p>&mdash;I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long atthis work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am wrong.</p><p>&mdash;A learner rather, Stephen said.</p><p>And here what will you learn more?</p><p>Mr Deasy shook his head.</p><p>&mdash;Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the greatteacher.</p><p>Stephen rustled the sheets again.</p><p>&mdash;As regards these, he began.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have thempublished at once.</p><p><i> Telegraph. Irish Homestead.</i></p><p>&mdash;I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two editorsslightly.</p><p>&mdash;That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the CityArms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You see if you canget it into your two papers. What are they?</p><p><i>&mdash;The Evening Telegraph...</i></p><p>&mdash;That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have toanswer that letter from my cousin.</p><p>&mdash;Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket. Thankyou.</p><p>&mdash;Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I liketo break a lance with you, old as I am.</p><p>&mdash;Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.</p><p>He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees, hearingthe cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield. The lions couchanton the pillars as he passed out through the gate: toothless terrors. Still Iwill help him in his fight. Mulligan will dub me a new name: thebullockbefriending bard.</p><p>&mdash;Mr Dedalus!</p><p>Running after me. No more letters, I hope.</p><p>&mdash;Just one moment.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.</p><p>Mr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.</p><p>&mdash;I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour ofbeing the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know that? No.And do you know why?</p><p>He frowned sternly on the bright air.</p><p>&mdash;Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.</p><p>&mdash;Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.</p><p>A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattlingchain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing, his lifted armswaving to the air.</p><p>&mdash;She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he stampedon gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That’s why.</p><p>On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles,dancing coins.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="chap03"></a>[ 3 ]</h3><p>Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought throughmy eyes.

He stoodsuddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the quaking soil. Turn back.</p><p>Turning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly in newsockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the barbacans theshafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my feet are sinking, creepingduskward over the dial floor. Blue dusk, nightfall, deep blue night. In thedarkness of the dome they wait, their pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise,around a board of abandoned platters. Who to clear it? He has the key. I willnot sleep there when this night comes. A shut door of a silent tower, entombingtheir blind bodies, the panthersahib and his pointer. Call: no answer. Helifted his feet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Takeall, keep all. My soul walks with me, form of forms.

They have tucked itsafe mong the bulrushes. Peekaboo. I see you. No, the dog. He is running backto them. Who?</p><p>Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeakedprows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawksaglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold. A school ofturlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows. Thenfrom the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, withflayers’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat. Famine,plague and slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I movedamong them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the splutteringresin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.</p><p>The dog’s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy. I justsimply stood pale, silent, bayed about. <i>Terribilia meditans</i>. A primrosedoublet, fortune’s knave, smiled on my fear. For that are you pining, the barkof their applause? Pretenders: live their lives.

When I put my face intoit in the basin at Clongowes. Can’t see! Who’s behind me? Out quickly, quickly!Do you see the tide flowing quickly in on all sides, sheeting the lows of sandquickly, shellcocoacoloured? If I had land under my feet. I want his life stillto be his, mine to be mine. A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me out ofhorror of his death. I... With him together down... I could not save her.Waters: bitter death: lost.</p><p>A woman and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.</p><p>Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on allsides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made off like abounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull. Theman’s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He turned, bounded back, camenearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a field tenney a buck, trippant,proper, unattired. At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiffforehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herdsof seamorse. They serpented towards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests,every ninth, breaking, plashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.</p><p>Cocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping, soused theirbags and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped running to them, rearedup and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again reared up at them with mutebearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand,a rag of wolf’s tongue redpanting from his jaws. His speckled body ambled aheadof them and then loped off at a calf’s gallop. The carcass lay on his path. Hestopped, sniffed, stalked round it, brother, nosing closer, went round it,sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog’s bedraggled fell. Dogskull,dogsniff, eyes on the ground, moves to one great goal. Ah, poor dogsbody! Herelies poor dogsbody’s body.</p><p>&mdash;Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!</p><p>The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick senthim unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He slunk back in acurve. Doesn’t see me. Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped, dawdled,smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it. He trottedforward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock.The simple pleasures of the poor. His hindpaws then scattered the sand: thenhis forepaws dabbled and delved. Something he buried there, his grandmother. Herooted in the sand, dabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scrapedup the sand again with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther,got in spousebreach, vulturing the dead.</p><p>After he woke me last night same dream or was it? Wait. Open hallway. Street ofharlots. Remember. Haroun al Raschid. I am almosting it. That man led me,spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held against my face. Smiled:creamfruit smell. That was the rule, said. In. Come. Red carpet spread. Youwill see who.</p><p>Shouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians. His blued feet out ofturnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler strangling hisunshaven neck. With woman steps she followed: the ruffian and his strollingmort. Spoils slung at her back. Loose sand and shellgrit crusted her bare feet.About her windraw face hair trailed. Behind her lord, his helpmate, bing awastto Romeville. When night hides her body’s flaws calling under her brown shawlfrom an archway where dogs have mired. Her fancyman is treating two RoyalDublins in O’Loughlin’s of Blackpitts.

I am not.Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun’s flaming sword, to thewest, trekking to evening lands. She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags,trascines her load. A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake. Tides,myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, <i>oinopa ponton</i>, a winedarksea. Behold the handmaid of the moon. In sleep the wet sign calls her hour,bids her rise. Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled. <i>Omnis caro adte veniet</i>.

Thanking you for thehospitality tear the blank end off. Turning his back to the sun he bent overfar to a table of rock and scribbled words. That’s twice I forgot to take slipsfrom the library counter.</p><p>His shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till thefarthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness shining in thebrightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there with his augur’s rod ofash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid sea, unbeheld, in violet nightwalking beneath a reign of uncouth stars. I throw this ended shadow from me,manshape ineluctable, call it back. Endless, would it be mine, form of my form?Who watches me here? Who ever anywhere will read these written words? Signs ona white field. Somewhere to someone in your flutiest voice. The good bishop ofCloyne took the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space withcoloured emblems hatched on its field. Hold hard. Coloured on a flat: yes,that’s right. Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat I see, east,back. Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in stereoscope. Click does thetrick. You find my words dark. Darkness is in our souls do you not think?Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our sins, cling to us yet more, a woman toher lover clinging, the more the more.</p><p>She trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue hell amI bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality of theineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at Hodges Figgis’window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you were going towrite. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through the braided jesse of hersunshade. She lives in Leeson park with a grief and kickshaws, a lady ofletters. Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a pickmeup. Bet she wears thosecurse of God stays suspenders and yellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool.Talk about apple dumplings, <i>piuttosto</i>. Where are your wits?</p><p>Touch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me soon,now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone. Sad too. Touch,touch me.</p><p>He lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled noteand pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes. That is Kevin Egan’smovement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep. <i>Et vidit Deus. Et erantvalde bona</i>. Alo! <i>Bonjour</i>. Welcome as the flowers in May. Under itsleaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the southing sun. I am caughtin this burning scene. Pan’s hour, the faunal noon. Among gumheavyserpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the tawny waters leaves lie wide.Pain is far.</p><p class="poem">And no more turn aside and brood.</p><p>His gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck’s castoffs,<i>nebeneinander</i>. He counted the creases of rucked leather whereinanother’s foot had nested warm. The foot that beat the ground in tripudium,foot I dislove. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt’s shoe went on you:girl I knew in Paris. <i>Tiens, quel petit pied!</i> Staunch friend, a brothersoul: Wilde’s love that dare not speak its name.

No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the low rocks,swirling, passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a fourwordedwavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of waters amidseasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it slops: flop, slop, slap:bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech ceases. It flows purling, widelyflowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.</p><p>Under the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and swayreluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water swaying andupturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night: lifted, flooded andlet fall. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to, they sigh. Saint Ambroseheard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting, awaiting the fullness of theirtimes, <i>diebus ac noctibus iniurias patiens ingemiscit</i>.

A shiver of the trees, signal, the evening wind. Ipass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from her doorway. She calls herchildren home in their dark language. High wall: beyond strings twanged. Nightsky, moon, violet, colour of Molly’s new garters. Strings. Listen. A girlplaying one of those instruments what do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.</p><p>Probably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track of thesun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself. What ArthurGriffith said about the headpiece over the <i>Freeman</i> leader: a homerulesun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland. Heprolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule sun rising up in thenorthwest.</p><p>He approached Larry O’Rourke’s. From the cellar grating floated up the flabbygush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger,teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the end of the city traffic.For instance M’Auley’s down there: n. g. as position. Of course if they ran atramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays valuewould go up like a shot.</p><p>Baldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an ad.Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my bold Larry,leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curateswab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyesscrewed up. Do you know what I’m going to tell you? What’s that, Mr O’Rourke?Do you know what? The Russians, they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast forthe Japanese.</p><p>Stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor Dignam, MrO’Rourke.</p><p>Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway:</p><p>&mdash;Good day, Mr O’Rourke.</p><p>&mdash;Good day to you.</p><p>&mdash;Lovely weather, sir.</p><p>&mdash;’Tis all that.</p><p>Where do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the countyLeitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and behold, theyblossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then think of the competition.General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub. Saveit they can’t. Off the drunks perhaps. Put down three and carry five. What isthat, a bob here and there, dribs and drabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps.Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers. Square it you with the bossand we’ll split the job, see?</p><p>How much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels ofstuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint Joseph’sNational school. Brats’ clamour. Windows open. Fresh air helps memory. Or alilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee doubleyou. Boys are they?Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At their joggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.</p><p>He halted before Dlugacz’s window, staring at the hanks of sausages, polonies,black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened in his mind,unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links, packed with forcemeat,fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicypigs’ blood.</p><p>A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He stood bythe nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling the items froma slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a pound and a half of Denny’ssausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips. Woods his name is. Wonder whathe does. Wife is oldish. New blood. No followers allowed. Strong pair of arms.Whacking a carpet on the clothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way hercrooked skirt swings at each whack.</p><p>The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchyfingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.</p><p>He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at Kinnereth onthe lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter sanatorium. MosesMontefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round it, blurred cattlecropping. He held the page from him: interesting: read it nearer, the title,the blurred cropping cattle, the page rustling. A young white heifer. Thosemornings in the cattlemarket, the beasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep,flop and fall of dung, the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through thelitter, slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one,unpeeled switches in their hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bendinghis senses and his will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirtswinging, whack by whack by whack.</p><p>The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime sausagesand made a red grimace.</p><p>&mdash;Now, my miss, he said.</p><p>She tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.</p><p>&mdash;Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you, please?</p><p>Mr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly,behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the morning. Hurry up,damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood outside the shop in sunlightand sauntered lazily to the right. He sighed down his nose: they neverunderstand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted toenails too. Brown scapulars intatters, defending her both ways. The sting of disregard glowed to weakpleasure within his breast. For another: a constable off duty cuddling her inEccles’ Lane. They like them sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman,I’m lost in the wood.</p><p>&mdash;Threepence, please.</p><p>His hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket. Then itfetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them on the rubberprickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into thetill.</p><p>&mdash;Thank you, sir. Another time.</p><p>A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze after aninstant. No: better not: another time.</p><p>&mdash;Good morning, he said, moving away.</p><p>&mdash;Good morning, sir.</p><p>No sign. Gone. What matter?</p><p>He walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim: planters’company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish government and plant witheucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel and construction. Orangegroves andimmense melonfields north of Jaffa. You pay eighty marks and they plant a dunamof land for you with olives, oranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper:oranges need artificial irrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop.Your name entered for life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten downand the balance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. 15.</p><p>Nothing doing. Still an idea behind it.</p><p>He looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered olivetrees.Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in jars, eh? I have a fewleft from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows the taste of them now.Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons too. Wonder is poor Citronstill in Saint Kevin’s parade. And Mastiansky with the old cither. Pleasantevenings we had then. Molly in Citron’s basketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxenfruit, hold in the hand, lift it to the nostrils and smell the perfume. Likethat, heavy, sweet, wild perfume. Always the same, year after year. Theyfetched high prices too, Moisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street:pleasant old times. Must be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way:Spain, Gibraltar, Mediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside atJaffa, chap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot insoiled dungarees. There’s whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesn’t see.Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back is like that Norwegiancaptain’s. Wonder if I’ll meet him today. Watering cart. To provoke the rain.On earth as it is in heaven.</p><p>A cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.</p><p>No, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead sea: nofish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those waves, greymetal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it raining down: thecities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead names. A dead sea in adead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the oldest, the first race. A benthag crossed from Cassidy’s, clutching a naggin bottle by the neck. The oldestpeople. Wandered far away over all the earth, captivity to captivity,multiplying, dying, being born everywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bearno more. Dead: an old woman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.</p><p>Desolation.</p><p>Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned intoEccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins, chilling hisblood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I am here now. Yes, I am herenow. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong side of the bed. Must begin againthose Sandow’s exercises. On the hands down. Blotchy brown brick houses. Numbereighty still unlet. Why is that? Valuation is only twentyeight. Towers,Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters ona sore eye. To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter.Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.</p><p>Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim sandals,along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a girl with goldhair on the wind.</p><p>Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered them. MrsMarion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand. Mrs Marion.</p><p>&mdash;Poldy!</p><p>Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellowtwilight towards her tousled head.</p><p>&mdash;Who are the letters for?</p><p>He looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.</p><p>&mdash;A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And aletter for you.</p><p>He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees.</p><p>&mdash;Do you want the blind up?</p><p>Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance atthe letter and tuck it under her pillow.</p><p>&mdash;That do? he asked, turning.</p><p>She was reading the card, propped on her elbow.</p><p>&mdash;She got the things, she said.</p><p>He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly witha snug sigh.</p><p>&mdash;Hurry up with that tea, she said. I’m parched.</p><p>&mdash;The kettle is boiling, he said.</p><p>But he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled linen:and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.</p><p>As he went down the kitchen stairs she called:</p><p>&mdash;Poldy!</p><p>&mdash;What?</p><p>&mdash;Scald the teapot.</p><p>On the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and rinsedout the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the kettle then tolet the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off the kettle, crushedthe pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt.While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him. Give her toomuch meat she won’t mouse. Say they won’t eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let thebloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling buttersauce. Pepper. He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chippedeggcup.</p><p>Then he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks: new tam:Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s seaside girls.</p><p>The tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby, smiling.Silly Milly’s birthday gift. Only five she was then. No, wait: four. I gave herthe amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces of folded brown paper in theletterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.</p><p class="poem">O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.<br/>You are my lookingglass from night to morning.<br/>I’d rather have you without a farthing<br/>Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.</p><p>Poor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous oldchap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And the littlemirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into the parlour. O, lookwhat I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! All we laughed. Sex breaking out eventhen. Pert little piece she was.</p><p>He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the teapoton the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on it? Bread andbutter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it upstairs, his thumbhooked in the teapot handle.</p><p>Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on thechair by the bedhead.</p><p>&mdash;What a time you were! she said.</p><p>She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on thepillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs,sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder. The warmth of her couchedbody rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured.</p><p>A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the act ofgoing he stayed to straighten the bedspread.</p><p>&mdash;Who was the letter from? he asked.</p><p>Bold hand. Marion.</p><p>&mdash;O, Boylan, she said. He’s bringing the programme.</p><p>&mdash;What are you singing?</p><p>&mdash;<i>Là ci darem</i> with J. C. Doyle, she said, and <i>Love’s Old SweetSong</i>.</p><p>Her full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves nextday. Like foul flowerwater.</p><p>&mdash;Would you like the window open a little?</p><p>She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:</p><p>&mdash;What time is the funeral?</p><p>&mdash;Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn’t see the paper.</p><p>Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawersfrom the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled,shiny sole.</p><p>&mdash;No: that book.</p><p>Other stocking. Her petticoat.</p><p>&mdash;It must have fell down, she said.</p><p>He felt here and there. <i>Voglio e non vorrei</i>. Wonder if she pronouncesthat right: <i>voglio</i>. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped andlifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of theorangekeyed chamberpot.</p><p>&mdash;Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There’s a word I wanted to askyou.</p><p>She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and, having wipedher fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the text with thehairpin till she reached the word.</p><p>&mdash;Met him what? he asked.</p><p>&mdash;Here, she said. What does that mean?</p><p>He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.</p><p>&mdash;Metempsychosis?</p><p>&mdash;Yes. Who’s he when he’s at home?</p><p>&mdash;Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It’s Greek: from the Greek. Thatmeans the transmigration of souls.</p><p>&mdash;O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.</p><p>He smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same young eyes. The firstnight after the charades. Dolphin’s Barn. He turned over the smudged pages.<i>Ruby: the Pride of the Ring</i>. Hello. Illustration. Fierce Italian withcarriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked. Sheet kindly lent.<i>The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim from him with an oath</i>.Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals. Trapeze at Hengler’s. Had to look theother way. Mob gaping. Break your neck and we’ll break our sides. Families ofthem. Bone them young so they metamspychosis. That we live after death. Oursouls. That a man’s soul after he dies. Dignam’s soul...</p><p>&mdash;Did you finish it? he asked.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, she said. There’s nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with thefirst fellow all the time?</p><p>&mdash;Never read it. Do you want another?</p><p>&mdash;Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock’s. Nice name he has.</p><p>She poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.</p><p>Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they’ll write to Kearney, myguarantor. Reincarnation: that’s the word.</p><p>&mdash;Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body afterdeath, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That we all livedbefore on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet. They say wehave forgotten it. Some say they remember their past lives.</p><p>The sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Better remind her ofthe word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An example?</p><p>The <i>Bath of the Nymph</i> over the bed. Given away with the Easter number of<i>Photo Bits</i>: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before you put milkin. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and six I gave for theframe. She said it would look nice over the bed. Naked nymphs: Greece: and forinstance all the people that lived then.</p><p>He turned the pages back.</p><p>&mdash;Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They usedto believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for instance. Whatthey called nymphs, for example.</p><p>Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her, inhalingthrough her arched nostrils.</p><p>&mdash;There’s a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?</p><p>&mdash;The kidney! he cried suddenly.</p><p>He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes againstthe broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping hastily down thestairs with a flurried stork’s legs. Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet froma side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detachedit and turned it turtle on its back. Only a little burnt. He tossed it off thepan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it.</p><p>Cup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf. He shoreaway the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a forkful into hismouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat. Done to a turn. Amouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of bread, sopped one in the gravy andput it in his mouth. What was that about some young student and a picnic? Hecreased out the letter at his side, reading it slowly as he chewed, soppinganother die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth.<br/><br/></p><p>Dearest Papli</p><p>Thanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me splendid.Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got mummy’s lovely box ofcreams and am writing. They are lovely. I am getting on swimming in the photobusiness now.

Remember the summer morning she was born, running toknock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Jolly old woman. Lot of babies shemust have helped into the world. She knew from the first poor little Rudywouldn’t live. Well, God is good, sir. She knew at once. He would be eleven nowif he had lived.</p><p>His vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. Excuse bad writing. Hurry.Piano downstairs. Coming out of her shell. Row with her in the XL Café aboutthe bracelet. Wouldn’t eat her cakes or speak or look. Saucebox. He soppedother dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after piece of kidney. Twelveand six a week. Not much. Still, she might do worse. Music hall stage. Youngstudent. He drank a draught of cooler tea to wash down his meal. Then he readthe letter again: twice.</p><p>O, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing has happened.Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild piece of goods. Herslim legs running up the staircase. Destiny. Ripening now. Vain: very.</p><p>He smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught her inthe street pinching her cheeks to make them red. Anemic a little. Was givenmilk too long. On the <i>Erin’s King</i> that day round the Kish. Damned oldtub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her pale blue scarf loose in the wind withher hair.</p><p class="poem">All dimpled cheeks and curls,<br/>Your head it simply swirls.</p><p>Seaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers’ pockets, jarvey offfor the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says. Pier with lamps,summer evening, band.</p><p class="poem">Those girls, those girls,<br/>Those lovely seaside girls.</p><p>Milly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion. Reading,lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling, braiding.</p><p>A soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen, yes.Prevent. Useless: can’t move. Girl’s sweet light lips. Will happen too. He feltthe flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now. Lips kissed, kissing,kissed. Full gluey woman’s lips.</p><p>Better where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass thetime. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two and sixreturn. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or through M’Coy.</p><p>The cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper, nosedat it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing. Wants to go out.Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her wait. Has the fidgets.Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her ear with her back to the firetoo.</p><p>He felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up,undoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.</p><p>&mdash;Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I’m ready.</p><p>Heaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to thelanding.</p><p>A paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as I’m.</p><p>In the tabledrawer he found an old number of <i>Titbits</i>. He folded it underhis armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in soft bounds. Ah,wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.</p><p>Listening, he heard her voice:</p><p>&mdash;Come, come, pussy. Come.</p><p>He went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen towards thenext garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry. The maid was in thegarden. Fine morning.</p><p>He bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall. Make asummerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to manure the wholeplace over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur. All soil like that withoutdung. Household slops. Loam, what is this that is? The hens in the next garden:their droppings are very good top dressing. Best of all though are the cattle,especially when they are fed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing toclean ladies’ kid gloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place.Grow peas in that corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Stillgardens have their drawbacks. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.</p><p>He walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the peg. Orhanging up on the floor. Funny I don’t remember that. Hallstand too full. Fourumbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters. Drago’s shopbell ringing.Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown brillantined hair over his collar.Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder have I time for a bath this morning. Tarastreet. Chap in the paybox there got away James Stephens, they say. O’Brien.</p><p>Deep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss.Enthusiast.</p><p>He kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to get thesetrousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head under the lowlintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy limewash and stalecobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he peered through a chink upat the nextdoor windows. The king was in his countinghouse. Nobody.</p><p>Asquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over on hisbared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it a bit. Our prizetitbit: <i>Matcham’s Masterstroke</i>. Written by Mr Philip Beaufoy, Playgoers’Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea a column has been made to thewriter. Three and a half. Three pounds three. Three pounds, thirteen and six.</p><p>Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding butresisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowedhis bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently thatslight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it’s not too big bring onpiles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One tabloid of cascara sagrada.Life might be so. It did not move or touch him but it was something quick andneat. Print anything now. Silly season. He read on, seated calm above his ownrising smell. Neat certainly. <i>Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke bywhich he won the laughing witch who now</i>. Begins and ends morally. <i>Handin hand</i>. Smart. He glanced back through what he had read and, while feelinghis water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it andreceived payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.</p><p>Might manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for someproverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she saiddressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving.

Allude to it. Strangekind of music that last night. The mirror was in shadow. She rubbed herhandglass briskly on her woollen vest against her full wagging bub. Peeringinto it. Lines in her eyes. It wouldn’t pan out somehow.</p><p>Evening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers andeyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black. Still, trueto life also. Day: then the night.</p><p>He tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it. Then hegirded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled back the jerkyshaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom into the air.</p><p>In the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his blacktrousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees.

By Brady’scottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal linked, smoking achewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of eczema on her forehead eyed him,listlessly holding her battered caskhoop. Tell him if he smokes he won’t grow.O let him! His life isn’t such a bed of roses. Waiting outside pubs to bring dahome. Come home to ma, da. Slack hour: won’t be many there. He crossed Townsendstreet, passed the frowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth.

While his eyes still read blandly he took off hishat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his right hand with slow grace overhis brow and hair. Very warm morning. Under their dropped lids his eyes foundthe tiny bow of the leather headband inside his high grade ha. Just there. Hisright hand came down into the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a cardbehind the headband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.</p><p>So warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and hair. Thenhe put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice blend, made of thefinest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it must be: the garden of theworld, big lazy leaves to float about on, cactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianasthey call them. Wonder is it like that. Those Cinghalese lobbing about in thesun in <i>dolce far niente</i>, not doing a hand’s turn all day. Sleep sixmonths out of twelve. Too hot to quarrel. Influence of the climate. Lethargy.Flowers of idleness. The air feeds most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens.Sensitive plants. Waterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in theair. Walk on roseleaves. Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. Where was thechap I saw in that picture somewhere? Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on hisback, reading a book with a parasol open. Couldn’t sink if you tried: so thickwith salt. Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of the body in thewater is equal to the weight of the what? Or is it the volume is equal to theweight? It’s a law something like that. Vance in High school cracking hisfingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum. Cracking curriculum. What isweight really when you say the weight? Thirtytwo feet per second per second.Law of falling bodies: per second per second. They all fall to the ground. Theearth. It’s the force of gravity of the earth is the weight.</p><p>He turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with hersausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded <i>Freeman</i>from his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and tapped itat each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless air: just drop in tosee. Per second per second. Per second for every second it means. From thecurbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of the postoffice. Too latebox. Post here. No-one. In.</p><p>He handed the card through the brass grill.</p><p>&mdash;Are there any letters for me? he asked.</p><p>While the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting posterwith soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his baton against hisnostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer probably. Went too farlast time.</p><p>The postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a letter. Hethanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.</p><p class="poem">Henry Flower Esq,<br/>c/o P. O. Westland Row,<br/>            City.</p><p>Answered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket, reviewingagain the soldiers on parade. Where’s old Tweedy’s regiment? Castoff soldier.There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he’s a grenadier. Pointed cuffs.There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats. Too showy. That must be why thewomen go after them. Uniform. Easier to enlist and drill. Maud Gonne’s letterabout taking them off O’Connell street at night: disgrace to our Irish capital.Griffith’s paper is on the same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease:overseas or halfseasover empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like. Eyesfront. Mark time. Table: able. Bed: ed. The King’s own. Never see him dressedup as a fireman or a bobby. A mason, yes.</p><p>He strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if thatwould mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger felt its wayunder the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks. Women will pay a lotof heed, I don’t think. His fingers drew forth the letter the letter andcrumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something pinned on: photo perhaps. Hair?No.</p><p>M’Coy. Get rid of him quickly. Take me out of my way. Hate company when you.</p><p>&mdash;Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?</p><p>&mdash;Hello, M’Coy. Nowhere in particular.</p><p>&mdash;How’s the body?</p><p>&mdash;Fine. How are you?</p><p>&mdash;Just keeping alive, M’Coy said.</p><p>His eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:</p><p>&mdash;Is there any... no trouble I hope? I see you’re...</p><p>&mdash;O, no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.</p><p>&mdash;To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?</p><p>A photo it isn’t. A badge maybe.</p><p>&mdash;E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered.</p><p>&mdash;I must try to get out there, M’Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard itlast night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?</p><p>&mdash;I know.</p><p>Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of theGrosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood still,waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets forchange. Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this,looks like blanketcloth. Careless stand of her with her hands in those patchpockets. Like that haughty creature at the polo match. Women all for caste tillyou touch the spot. Handsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. Thehonourable Mrs and Brutus is an honourable man. Possess her once take thestarch out of her.</p><p>&mdash;I was with Bob Doran, he’s on one of his periodical bends, and what doyou call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conway’s we were.</p><p>Doran Lyons in Conway’s. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In came Hoppy.Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his vailedeyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums.Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight perhaps. Talking ofone thing or another. Lady’s hand. Which side will she get up?</p><p>&mdash;And he said: <i>Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy?</i> Isaid. <i>Poor little Paddy Dignam</i>, he said.</p><p>Off to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces dangling.Wellturned foot. What is he foostering over that change for? Sees me looking.Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two strings to her bow.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Why?</i> I said. <i>What’s wrong with him?</i> I said.</p><p>Proud: rich: silk stockings.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, Mr Bloom said.</p><p>He moved a little to the side of M’Coy’s talking head. Getting up in a minute.</p><p>&mdash;<i>What’s wrong with him</i>? He said. <i>He’s dead</i>, he said. And,faith, he filled up. <i>Is it Paddy Dignam</i>? I said. I couldn’t believe itwhen I heard it. I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it inthe Arch. <i>Yes,</i> he said. <i>He’s gone. He died on Monday, poorfellow</i>.</p><p>Watch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!</p><p>A heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.</p><p>Lost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise and theperi. Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace streethallway Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering the display of.<i>Esprit de corps</i>. Well, what are you gaping at?</p><p>&mdash;Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.</p><p>&mdash;One of the best, M’Coy said.</p><p>The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich glovedhand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun:flicker, flick.</p><p>&mdash;Wife well, I suppose? M’Coy’s changed voice said.</p><p>&mdash;O, yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.</p><p>He unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:</p><p class="poem">What is home without<br/>Plumtree’s Potted Meat?<br/>Incomplete.<br/>With it an abode of bliss.</p><p>&mdash;My missus has just got an engagement. At least it’s not settled yet.</p><p>Valise tack again. By the way no harm. I’m off that, thanks.</p><p>Mr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.</p><p>&mdash;My wife too, he said. She’s going to sing at a swagger affair in theUlster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.</p><p>&mdash;That so? M’Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who’s getting it up?</p><p>Mrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and. Nobook. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens. Dark lady and fairman. Letter. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of envelope.</p><p class="poem">Love’s<br/>Old<br/>Sweet<br/>Song<br/>Comes lo-ove’s old...</p><p>&mdash;It’s a kind of a tour, don’t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.<i>Sweeeet song</i>. There’s a committee formed. Part shares and part profits.</p><p>M’Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.</p><p>&mdash;O, well, he said. That’s good news.</p><p>He moved to go.</p><p>&mdash;Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, Mr Bloom said.</p><p>&mdash;Tell you what, M’Coy said. You might put down my name at the funeral,will you? I’d like to go but I mightn’t be able, you see. There’s a drowningcase at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself would have to godown if the body is found. You just shove in my name if I’m not there, willyou?</p><p>&mdash;I’ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That’ll be all right.</p><p>&mdash;Right, M’Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I’d go if I possibly could.Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M’Coy will do.</p><p>&mdash;That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.</p><p>Didn’t catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I’d like myjob. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped corners, rivettededges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him his for the Wicklowregatta concert last year and never heard tidings of it from that good day tothis.</p><p>Mr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has just gotan. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in its way: for alittle ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don’t you know: in the same boat.Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would. Can’t he hear the difference?Think he’s that way inclined a bit. Against my grain somehow. Thought thatBelfast would fetch him. I hope that smallpox up there doesn’t get worse.Suppose she wouldn’t let herself be vaccinated again. Your wife and my wife.</p><p>Wonder is he pimping after me?</p><p>Mr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicolouredhoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane’s Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery’s Summer Sale.No, he’s going on straight. Hello. <i>Leah</i> tonight. Mrs Bandmann Palmer.Like to see her again in that. <i>Hamlet</i> she played last night. Maleimpersonator. Perhaps he was a woman. Why Ophelia committed suicide. Poor papa!How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that. Outside the Adelphi in Londonwaited all the afternoon to get in. Year before I was born that was: sixtyfive.And Ristori in Vienna. What is this the right name is? By Mosenthal it is.Rachel, is it? No. The scene he was always talking about where the old blindAbraham recognises the voice and puts his fingers on his face.</p><p>Nathan’s voice! His son’s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his fatherto die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his father andleft the God of his father.</p><p>Every word is so deep, Leopold.</p><p>Poor papa! Poor man! I’m glad I didn’t go into the room to look at his face.That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for him.</p><p>Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard. Nouse thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn’t met that M’Coy fellow.</p><p>He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing teeth.Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet oaten reek ofhorsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn all they know or care aboutanything with their long noses stuck in nosebags. Too full for words. Stillthey get their feed all right and their doss. Gelded too: a stump of blackguttapercha wagging limp between their haunches. Might be happy all the samethat way. Good poor brutes they look. Still their neigh can be very irritating.</p><p>He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried.Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.</p><p>He passed the cabman’s shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies. Allweathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own. <i>Voglio enon</i>. Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a few flyingsyllables as they pass. He hummed:</p><p class="poem">Là ci darem la mano<br/>La la lala la la.</p><p>He turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the lee ofthe station wall. No-one. Meade’s timberyard. Piled balks. Ruins and tenements.With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with its forgottenpickeystone. Not a sinner. Near the timberyard a squatted child at marbles,alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. A wise tabby, a blinking sphinx,watched from her warm sill. Pity to disturb them. Mohammed cut a piece out ofhis mantle not to wake her. Open it. And once I played marbles when I went tothat old dame’s school. She liked mignonette. Mrs Ellis’s. And Mr? He openedthe letter within the newspaper.</p><p>A flower. I think it’s a. A yellow flower with flattened petals. Not annoyedthen? What does she say?<br/><br/></p><p>Dear Henry</p><p>I got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry you didnot like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am awfully angrywith you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called you naughty boybecause I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the real meaningof that word? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? I dowish I could do something for you. Please tell me what you think of poor me. Ioften think of the beautiful name you have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? Ithink of you so often you have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawnto a man as you. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell memore. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what I will doto you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to meet you.

Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then walking slowly forwardhe read the letter again, murmuring here and there a word. Angry tulips withyou darling manflower punish your cactus if you don’t please poor forgetmenothow I long violets to dear roses when we soon anemone meet all naughtynightstalk wife Martha’s perfume. Having read it all he took it from thenewspaper and put it back in his sidepocket.</p><p>Weak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did she wroteit herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me, respectablecharacter. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary. Thank you: not having any.Usual love scrimmage. Then running round corners. Bad as a row with Molly.Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic. Go further next time. Naughty boy:punish: afraid of words, of course. Brutal, why not? Try it anyhow. A bit at atime.</p><p>Fingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it. Common pin,eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere: pinned together.Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses without thorns.</p><p>Flat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in theCoombe, linked together in the rain.</p><p class="poem">O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.<br/>She didn’t know what to do<br/>To keep it up,<br/>To keep it up.</p><p>It?

Just loll there: quietdusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have been, strangecustoms. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper: fruit, olives,lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole in the wall atAshtown. Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the trottingmatches. Shelistens with big dark soft eyes. Tell her: more and more: all. Then a sigh:silence. Long long long rest.</p><p>Going under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly inshreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered away, sank inthe dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.</p><p>Henry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the same way.Simple bit of paper. Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure cheque for a millionin the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be made out of porter. Still theother brother lord Ardilaun has to change his shirt four times a day, they say.Skin breeds lice or vermin. A million pounds, wait a moment. Twopence a pint,fourpence a quart, eightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence agallon of porter. One and four into twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly.Fifteen millions of barrels of porter.</p><p>What am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the same.</p><p>An incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach. Barrelsbumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside. The bungholessprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing together, winding throughmudflats all over the level land, a lazy pooling swirl of liquor bearing alongwideleaved flowers of its froth.</p><p>He had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the porch hedoffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again behind theleather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work M’Coy for a pass toMullingar.</p><p>Same notice on the door. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S. J. on saintPeter Claver S. J. and the African Mission. Prayers for the conversion ofGladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious. The protestants are thesame. Convert Dr William J. Walsh D.D. to the true religion. Save China’smillions. Wonder how they explain it to the heathen Chinee. Prefer an ounce ofopium. Celestials. Rank heresy for them. Buddha their god lying on his side inthe museum. Taking it easy with hand under his cheek. Josssticks burning. Notlike Ecce Homo. Crown of thorns and cross. Clever idea Saint Patrick theshamrock. Chopsticks? Conmee: Martin Cunningham knows him:distinguishedlooking. Sorry I didn’t work him about getting Molly into thechoir instead of that Father Farley who looked a fool but wasn’t. They’retaught that. He’s not going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off himto baptise blacks, is he? The glasses would take their fancy, flashing. Like tosee them sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening. Stilllife. Lap it up like milk, I suppose.</p><p>The cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps, pushed theswingdoor and entered softly by the rere.</p><p>Something going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place to benext some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow music. Thatwoman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the benches with crimsonhalters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch knelt at the altarrails. Thepriest went along by them, murmuring, holding the thing in his hands. Hestopped at each, took out a communion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?)off it and put it neatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank. Then the nextone. Her hat sank at once. Then the next one: a small old woman. The priestbent down to put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The nextone. Shut your eyes and open your mouth. What? <i>Corpus:</i> body. Corpse.Good idea the Latin. Stupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They don’tseem to chew it: only swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a corpse. Whythe cannibals cotton to it.</p><p>He stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by one, andseek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in its corner,nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear. We ought to havehats modelled on our heads. They were about him here and there, with headsstill bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for it to melt in their stomachs.Something like those mazzoth: it’s that sort of bread: unleavened shewbread.Look at them. Now I bet it makes them feel happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, breadof angels it’s called. There’s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God iswithin you feel. First communicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all likeone family party, same in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I’m sureof that. Not so lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit spreeish. Letoff steam. Thing is if you really believe in it. Lourdes cure, waters ofoblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding. Old fellow asleep nearthat confessionbox. Hence those snores. Blind faith. Safe in the arms ofkingdom come. Lulls all pain. Wake this time next year.</p><p>He saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an instantbefore it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace affair he had on.Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn’t know what to do to. Bald spotbehind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S. Molly told me one time I askedher. I have sinned: or no: I have suffered, it is. And the other one? Ironnails ran in.</p><p>Meet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up with a veiland black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be here with a ribbonround her neck and do the other thing all the same on the sly. Their character.That fellow that turned queen’s evidence on the invincibles he used to receivethe, Carey was his name, the communion every morning. This very church. PeterCarey, yes. No, Peter Claver I am thinking of. Denis Carey. And just imaginethat. Wife and six children at home. And plotting that murder all the time.Those crawthumpers, now that’s a good name for them, there’s always somethingshiftylooking about them. They’re not straight men of business either. O, no,she’s not here: the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up that envelope?Yes: under the bridge.</p><p>The priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs smartly.Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank what they areused to Guinness’s porter or some temperance beverage Wheatley’s Dublin hopbitters or Cantrell and Cochrane’s ginger ale (aromatic). Doesn’t give them anyof it: shew wine: only the other. Cold comfort. Pious fraud but quite right:otherwise they’d have one old booser worse than another coming along, cadgingfor a drink. Queer the whole atmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly rightthat is.</p><p>Mr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music. Pity. Whohas the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make that instrumenttalk, the <i>vibrato</i>: fifty pounds a year they say he had in Gardinerstreet. Molly was in fine voice that day, the <i>Stabat Mater</i> of Rossini.Father Bernard Vaughan’s sermon first. Christ or Pilate? Christ, but don’t keepus all night over it. Music they wanted. Footdrill stopped. Could hear a pindrop. I told her to pitch her voice against that corner. I could feel thethrill in the air, the full, the people looking up:</p><p><i>Quis est homo.</i></p><p>Some of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven last words. Mozart’stwelfth mass: <i>Gloria</i> in that. Those old popes keen on music, on art andstatues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example too. They had a gayold time while it lasted. Healthy too, chanting, regular hours, then brewliqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse. Still, having eunuchs in their choirthat was coming it a bit thick. What kind of voice is it? Must be curious tohear after their own strong basses. Connoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn’t feelanything after. Kind of a placid. No worry. Fall into flesh, don’t they?Gluttons, tall, long legs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.</p><p>He saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and blessall the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom glanced about himand then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand up at the gospel ofcourse. Then all settled down on their knees again and he sat back quietly inhis bench. The priest came down from the altar, holding the thing out from him,and he and the massboy answered each other in Latin. Then the priest knelt downand began to read off a card:</p><p>&mdash;O God, our refuge and our strength...</p><p>Mr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them the bone.I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Glorious and immaculatevirgin. Joseph, her spouse. Peter and Paul. More interesting if you understoodwhat it was all about.

Monasteries and convents. The priest in that Fermanagh willcase in the witnessbox. No browbeating him. He had his answer pat foreverything. Liberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The doctorsof the church: they mapped out the whole theology of it.</p><p>The priest prayed:</p><p>&mdash;Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be oursafeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God restrain him,we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly host, by the power ofGod thrust Satan down to hell and with him those other wicked spirits whowander through the world for the ruin of souls.</p><p>The priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The womenremained behind: thanksgiving.</p><p>Better be shoving along. Brother Buzz. Come around with the plate perhaps. Payyour Easter duty.</p><p>He stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the time?Women enjoy it. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there’s a (whh!) just a(whh!) fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked. Glimpses of the moon.Annoyed if you don’t. Why didn’t you tell me before. Still like you betteruntidy. Good job it wasn’t farther south. He passed, discreetly buttoning, downthe aisle and out through the main door into the light. He stood a momentunseeing by the cold black marble bowl while before him and behind twoworshippers dipped furtive hands in the low tide of holy water. Trams: a car ofPrescott’s dyeworks: a widow in her weeds. Notice because I’m in mourningmyself. He covered himself. How goes the time? Quarter past. Time enough yet.Better get that lotion made up.

Make it up, please. I’ll call later in the day andI’ll take one of these soaps. How much are they?</p><p>&mdash;Fourpence, sir.</p><p>Mr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils.

You can pay all together, sir, when you comeback.</p><p>&mdash;Good, Mr Bloom said.</p><p>He strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, thecoolwrappered soap in his left hand.</p><p>At his armpit Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said:</p><p>&mdash;Hello, Bloom. What’s the best news? Is that today’s? Show us a minute.</p><p>Shaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look younger.He does look balmy. Younger than I am.</p><p>Bantam Lyons’s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a wash too.Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears’ soap? Dandruff onhis shoulders.

Mr Power stepped in after him, curvinghis height with care.</p><p>&mdash;Come on, Simon.</p><p>&mdash;After you, Mr Bloom said.</p><p>Mr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:</p><p>&mdash;Yes, yes.</p><p>&mdash;Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.</p><p>Mr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to after himand slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm through the armstrapand looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of theavenue. One dragged aside: an old woman peeping. Nose whiteflattened againstthe pane. Thanking her stars she was passed over. Extraordinary the interestthey take in a corpse. Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Jobseems to suit them. Huggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers forfear he’d wake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Flemingmaking the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know whowill touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and thehair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same after. Unclean job.</p><p>All waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am sitting onsomething hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shift it out of that.Wait for an opportunity.</p><p>All waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: thenhorses’ hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying.Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of the avenue passedand number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. At walking pace.</p><p>They waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passingalong the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels rattled rollingover the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in thedoorframes.</p><p>&mdash;What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.</p><p>&mdash;Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.</p><p>Mr Dedalus nodded, looking out.</p><p>&mdash;That’s a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died out.</p><p>All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers.Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road pastWatery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a widehat.</p><p>&mdash;There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.</p><p>&mdash;Who is that?</p><p>&mdash;Your son and heir.</p><p>&mdash;Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.</p><p>The carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before thetenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack,rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:</p><p>&mdash;Was that Mulligan cad with him? His <i>fidus Achates</i>!</p><p>&mdash;No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.</p><p>&mdash;Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Gouldingfaction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa’s little lump of dung,the wise child that knows her own father.</p><p>Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the bottleworks:Dodder bridge.</p><p>Richie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm.His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing in Stamer streetwith Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady’s two hats pinned onhis head. Out on the rampage all night. Beginning to tell on him now: thatbackache of his, I fear. Wife ironing his back. Thinks he’ll cure it withpills. All breadcrumbs they are. About six hundred per cent profit.</p><p>&mdash;He’s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is acontaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks allover Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I’ll make it mybusiness to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt orwhatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. I’ll tickle hiscatastrophe, believe you me.</p><p>He cried above the clatter of the wheels:</p><p>&mdash;I won’t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper’s son.Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M’Swiney’s. Not likely.</p><p>He ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power’s mild faceand Martin Cunningham’s eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy selfwilled man.Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If little Rudy had lived.See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house. Walking beside Molly in an Etonsuit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange feeling it would be. From me. Just achance. Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the windowwatching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And thesergeant grinning up. She had that cream gown on with the rip she neverstitched. Give us a touch, Poldy. God, I’m dying for it. How life begins.</p><p>Got big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her. I couldhave helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn German too.</p><p>&mdash;Are we late? Mr Power asked.</p><p>&mdash;Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.</p><p>Molly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping Jupiter! Yegods and little fishes! Still, she’s a dear girl. Soon be a woman. Mullingar.Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too. Life, life.</p><p>The carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.</p><p>&mdash;Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.</p><p>&mdash;He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him. Doyou follow me?</p><p>He closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs fromunder his thighs.</p><p>&mdash;What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?</p><p>&mdash;Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Powersaid.</p><p>All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leatherof the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said:</p><p>&mdash;Unless I’m greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?</p><p>&mdash;It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.</p><p>Mr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite clean.But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.</p><p>Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly.</p><p>&mdash;After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>&mdash;Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak ofhis beard gently.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.</p><p>&mdash;And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.</p><p>&mdash;At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.</p><p>&mdash;I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he’d try to come.</p><p>The carriage halted short.</p><p>&mdash;What’s wrong?</p><p>&mdash;We’re stopped.</p><p>&mdash;Where are we?</p><p>Mr Bloom put his head out of the window.</p><p>&mdash;The grand canal, he said.</p><p>Gasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got it. Poorchildren! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame really. Got offlightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed tea. Scarlatina,influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don’t miss this chance. Dogs’ homeover there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish. Thywill be done. We obey them in the grave. A dying scrawl. He took it to heart,pined away. Quiet brute. Old men’s dogs usually are.</p><p>A raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower spraydots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander. I thought itwould. My boots were creaking I remember now.</p><p>&mdash;The weather is changing, he said quietly.</p><p>&mdash;A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.</p><p>&mdash;Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There’s the sun again coming out.</p><p>Mr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mutecurse at the sky.</p><p>&mdash;It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.</p><p>&mdash;We’re off again.</p><p>The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently.Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.</p><p>&mdash;Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking himoff to his face.</p><p>&mdash;O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear him,Simon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of <i>The Croppy Boy</i>.</p><p>&mdash;Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. <i>His singing of that simpleballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the wholecourse of my experience.</i></p><p>&mdash;Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He’s dead nuts on that. And theretrospective arrangement.</p><p>&mdash;Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech? Martin Cunningham asked.</p><p>&mdash;I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?</p><p>&mdash;In the paper this morning.</p><p>Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change forher.</p><p>&mdash;No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.</p><p>Mr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths:Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that? isit the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s? no, Sexton, Urbright. Inkedcharacters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper. Thanks to the LittleFlower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of his. Aged 88 after a longand tedious illness. Month’s mind: Quinlan. On whose soul Sweet Jesus havemercy.</p><p class="poem">It is now a month since dear Henry fled<br/>To his home up above in the sky<br/>While his family weeps and mourns his loss<br/>Hoping some day to meet him on high.</p><p>I tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it in thebath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled. Beforemy patience are exhausted.</p><p>National school. Meade’s yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding. Full asa tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round with a fare. Anhour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their hats.</p><p>A pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramwaystandard by Mr Bloom’s window. Couldn’t they invent something automatic so thatthe wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow would lose his job then?Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?</p><p>Antient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a crapearmlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law perhaps.</p><p>They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s, under the railway bridge, pastthe Queen’s theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs BandmannPalmer. Could I go to see <i>Leah</i> tonight, I wonder. I said I. Or the<i>Lily of Killarney</i>? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big powerful change. Wetbright bills for next week. <i>Fun on the Bristol</i>. Martin Cunningham couldwork a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink or two. As broad as it’slong.</p><p>He’s coming in the afternoon. Her songs.</p><p>Plasto’s. Sir Philip Crampton’s memorial fountain bust. Who was he?</p><p>&mdash;How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow insalute.</p><p>&mdash;He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?</p><p>&mdash;Who? Mr Dedalus asked.</p><p>&mdash;Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.</p><p>Just that moment I was thinking.</p><p>Mr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the white discof a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.</p><p>Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand. Thenails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees? Fascination.Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes feel what a personis. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am just looking at them: wellpared. And after: thinking alone. Body getting a bit softy. I would noticethat: from remembering. What causes that? I suppose the skin can’t contractquickly enough when the flesh falls off. But the shape is there. The shape isthere still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuckbetween the cheeks behind.</p><p>He clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glanceover their faces.</p><p>Mr Power asked:</p><p>&mdash;How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?</p><p>&mdash;O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It’s a goodidea, you see...</p><p>&mdash;Are you going yourself?</p><p>&mdash;Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the countyClare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the chief towns.What you lose on one you can make up on the other.</p><p>&mdash;Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.</p><p>Have you good artists?</p><p>&mdash;Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we’ll have alltopnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in fact.</p><p>&mdash;And <i>Madame</i>, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.</p><p>Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them.Smith O’Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman. Must be hisdeathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by Farrell’s statueunited noiselessly their unresisting knees.</p><p>Oot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouthopening: oot.</p><p>&mdash;Four bootlaces for a penny.</p><p>Wonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street. Samehouse as Molly’s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford. Has that silkhat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too. Terrible comedown, poorwretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake. O’Callaghan on his last legs.</p><p>And <i>Madame</i>. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doingher hair, humming: <i>voglio e non vorrei</i>. No: <i>vorrei e non</i>. Lookingat the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. <i>Mi trema un poco il</i>.Beautiful on that <i>tre</i> her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A throstle.There is a word throstle that expresses that.</p><p>His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face. Greyish over theears. <i>Madame</i>: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way. Onlypoliteness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the woman hekeeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it told me, there is nocarnal. You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick. Yes, it wasCrofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak. What is this shewas? Barmaid in Jury’s. Or the Moira, was it?</p><p>They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator’s form.</p><p>Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.</p><p>&mdash;Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.</p><p>A tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner ofElvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.</p><p>&mdash;In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.</p><p>Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:</p><p>&mdash;The devil break the hasp of your back!</p><p>Mr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as thecarriage passed Gray’s statue.</p><p>&mdash;We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.</p><p>His eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:</p><p>&mdash;Well, nearly all of us.</p><p>Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces.</p><p>&mdash;That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J andthe son.</p><p>&mdash;About the boatman? Mr Power asked.</p><p>&mdash;Yes. Isn’t it awfully good?</p><p>&mdash;What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn’t hear it.</p><p>&mdash;There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to sendhim to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were both.....</p><p>&mdash;What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?</p><p>&mdash;Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he triedto drown.....</p><p>&mdash;Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!</p><p>Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.</p><p>&mdash;No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....</p><p>Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:</p><p>&mdash;Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river ontheir way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got looseand over the wall with him into the Liffey.</p><p>&mdash;For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?</p><p>&mdash;Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fishedhim out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on thequay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is.....</p><p>&mdash;And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin forsaving his son’s life.</p><p>A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand.</p><p>&mdash;O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.</p><p>&mdash;Isn’t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.</p><p>&mdash;One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.</p><p>Mr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.</p><p>Nelson’s pillar.</p><p>&mdash;Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!</p><p>&mdash;We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.</p><p>Mr Dedalus sighed.</p><p>&mdash;Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh.Many a good one he told himself.</p><p>&mdash;The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with hisfingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he wasin his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this. He’s gone from us.</p><p>&mdash;As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went verysuddenly.</p><p>&mdash;Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.</p><p>He tapped his chest sadly.</p><p>Blazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose. Drink likethe devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent colouring it.</p><p>Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.</p><p>&mdash;He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.</p><p>&mdash;The best death, Mr Bloom said.</p><p>Their wide open eyes looked at him.</p><p>&mdash;No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.</p><p>No-one spoke.</p><p>Dead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents, temperancehotel, Falconer’s railway guide, civil service college, Gill’s, catholic club,the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or wind. At night too. Chummiesand slaveys. Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew. Foundation stonefor Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.</p><p>White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning coach.Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for a nun.</p><p>&mdash;Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.</p><p>A dwarf’s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy’s was. Dwarf’s body, weakas putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society pays. Penny a weekfor a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant nothing. Mistake of nature.If it’s healthy it’s from the mother. If not from the man. Better luck nexttime.</p><p>&mdash;Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It’s well out of it.</p><p>The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his bones.Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.</p><p>&mdash;In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.</p><p>&mdash;But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.</p><p>Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.</p><p>&mdash;The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.</p><p>&mdash;Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. Wemust take a charitable view of it.</p><p>&mdash;They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.</p><p>&mdash;It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.</p><p>Mr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham’s largeeyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent. LikeShakespeare’s face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy on that hereor infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive a stake of woodthrough his heart in the grave. As if it wasn’t broken already. Yet sometimesthey repent too late. Found in the riverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me.And that awful drunkard of a wife of his. Setting up house for her time aftertime and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading himthe life of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning.Start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight thatnight Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and capering withMartin’s umbrella.</p><p class="poem">And they call me the jewel of Asia,<br/>Of Asia,<br/>The geisha.</p><p>He looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.</p><p>That afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The room inthe hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through the slats ofthe Venetian blind. The coroner’s sunlit ears, big and hairy. Boots givingevidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellow streaks on hisface. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. Verdict: overdose. Death bymisadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.</p><p>No more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.</p><p>The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.</p><p>&mdash;We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.</p><p>&mdash;God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.</p><p>&mdash;I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrowin Germany. The Gordon Bennett.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.</p><p>As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over andafter them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody here seenKelly?

Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them abouttwentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for old England. Theybuy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff,hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a year. Dead meat trade. Byproductsof the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine. Wonder if that dodgeworks now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.</p><p>The carriage moved on through the drove.</p><p>&mdash;I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from theparkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken intrucks down to the boats.</p><p>&mdash;Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quiteright. They ought to.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to havemunicipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line out tothe cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all. Don’tyou see what I mean?</p><p>&mdash;O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloondiningroom.</p><p>&mdash;A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.</p><p>&mdash;Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn’t it be more decentthan galloping two abreast?</p><p>&mdash;Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.</p><p>&mdash;And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when thehearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road.</p><p>&mdash;That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fellabout the road. Terrible!</p><p>&mdash;First round Dunphy’s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.</p><p>&mdash;Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.</p><p>Bom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam shotout and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him. Redface: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what’s up now. Quite right to closeit. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose quickly. Much better to closeup all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.</p><p>&mdash;Dunphy’s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.</p><p>Dunphy’s corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A pause bythe wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we’ll pull up here on the wayback to drink his health. Pass round the consolation. Elixir of life.</p><p>But suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in theknocking about? He would and he wouldn’t, I suppose. Depends on where. Thecirculation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It would be betterto bury them in red: a dark red.</p><p>In silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted by,coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.</p><p>Crossguns bridge: the royal canal.</p><p>Water rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping barge,between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse.Aboard of the <i>Bugabu.</i></p><p>Their eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raftcoastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime,mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make awalking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or cycle down. Hire some old crock,safety. Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady’s. Developingwaterways. James M’Cann’s hobby to row me o’er the ferry. Cheaper transit. Byeasy stages. Houseboats. Camping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. PerhapsI will without writing. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping downlock by lock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted hisbrown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.</p><p>They drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.</p><p>&mdash;I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.</p><p>&mdash;Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.</p><p>&mdash;How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?</p><p>&mdash;Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.</p><p>The carriage steered left for Finglas road.</p><p>The stonecutter’s yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of landsilent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt ingrief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence: appealing. Thebest obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.</p><p>Passed.</p><p>On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton’s, an old tramp sat, grumbling,emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot. Afterlife’s journey.</p><p>Gloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.</p><p>Mr Power pointed.</p><p>&mdash;That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.</p><p>&mdash;So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.Murdered his brother. Or so they said.</p><p>&mdash;The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.</p><p>&mdash;Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That’s the maxim of thelaw. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to bewrongfully condemned.</p><p>They looked. Murderer’s ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered, tenantless,unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned. Murder. Themurderer’s image in the eye of the murdered. They love reading about it. Man’shead found in a garden. Her clothing consisted of. How she met her death.Recent outrage. The weapon used. Murderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace.The body to be exhumed. Murder will out.</p><p>Cramped in this carriage. She mightn’t like me to come that way without lettingher know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with their pants down.Never forgive you after. Fifteen.</p><p>The high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars, rare whiteforms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white formsand fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.</p><p>The felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put out hisarm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee. Hestepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.</p><p>Change that soap now. Mr Bloom’s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly andtransferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket. He steppedout of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.</p><p>Paltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It’s all the same. Pallbearers, goldreins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death. Beyond the hind carriage ahawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit. Simnel cakes those are, stucktogether: cakes for the dead. Dogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.</p><p>He followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walkingafter them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the twowreaths. He handed one to the boy.</p><p>Where is that child’s funeral disappeared to?</p><p>A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, draggingthrough the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block.The waggoner marching at their head saluted.</p><p>Coffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it withhis plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on abloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here every day? Mustbe twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount Jerome for the protestants.Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute. Shovelling them under bythe cartload doublequick. Thousands every hour. Too many in the world.</p><p>Mourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy, hardwoman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl’s face stained with dirt and tears,holding the woman’s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry. Fish’s face,bloodless and livid.</p><p>The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So much deadweight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First the stiff: thenthe friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with theirwreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the brother-in-law.</p><p>All walked after.</p><p>Martin Cunningham whispered:</p><p>&mdash;I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.</p><p>&mdash;What? Mr Power whispered. How so?</p><p>&mdash;His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had theQueen’s hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare. Anniversary.</p><p>&mdash;O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?</p><p>He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towardsthe cardinal’s mausoleum. Speaking.</p><p>&mdash;Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.</p><p>&mdash;I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily mortgaged.Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.</p><p>&mdash;How many children did he leave?</p><p>&mdash;Five. Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s.</p><p>&mdash;A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.</p><p>&mdash;A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.</p><p>&mdash;Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.</p><p>Has the laugh at him now.</p><p>He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had outlived him.Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must outlive the other.Wise men say. There are more women than men in the world. Condole with her.Your terrible loss. I hope you’ll soon follow him. For Hindu widows only. Shewould marry another. Him? No. Yet who knows after. Widowhood not the thingsince the old queen died. Drawn on a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmorememorial mourning. But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain inher heart of hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was thesubstance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie nomore in her warm bed.</p><p>&mdash;How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven’tseen you for a month of Sundays.</p><p>&mdash;Never better. How are all in Cork’s own town?</p><p>&mdash;I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambertsaid. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.</p><p>&mdash;And how is Dick, the solid man?</p><p>&mdash;Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.</p><p>&mdash;By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?</p><p>&mdash;Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the insuranceis cleared up.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?</p><p>&mdash;Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife’s brother. John Henry Menton isbehind. He put down his name for a quid.</p><p>&mdash;I’ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought tomind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.</p><p>&mdash;How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?</p><p>&mdash;Many a good man’s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.</p><p>They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind theboy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slenderfurrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there when thefather? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for thelast time. All he might have done. I owe three shillings to O’Grady. Would heunderstand? The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?</p><p>After a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light. Thecoffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at itscorners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each forecorner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners knelt here and there inprayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt,dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his rightknee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding itsbrim, bent over piously.</p><p>A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door.The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand,balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s belly. Who’ll readthe book? I, said the rook.</p><p>They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with afluent croak.</p><p>Father Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. <i>Dominenamine.</i> Bullyabout the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe betideanyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst sideways like asheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on him like a poisoned pup.Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn: burst sideways.</p><p><i>&mdash;Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine.</i></p><p>Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem mass. Crapeweepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist. Chilly place this.Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking hisheels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toad too. What swells him up thatway? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of the place maybe. Looks full up ofbad gas. Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place. Butchers, forinstance: they get like raw beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Downin the vaults of saint Werburgh’s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they haveto bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Outit rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you’re a goner.</p><p>My kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That’s better.</p><p>The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s bucketand shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and shook itagain. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you were before yourested. It’s all written down: he has to do it.</p><p><i>&mdash;Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.</i></p><p>The server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be betterto have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course ...</p><p>Holy water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed up withthat job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. What harm if hecould see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day a fresh batch:middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards,baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows’ breasts. Allthe year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top ofthem: sleep. On Dignam now.</p><p><i>&mdash;In paradisum.</i></p><p>Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over everybody.Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.</p><p>The priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny Kelleheropened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again,carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher gave one wreath tothe boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed them out of the sidedoorsinto the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into hispocket. He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to theleft. The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the packof blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.</p><p>The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn’t lilt here.</p><p>&mdash;The O’Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.</p><p>Mr Power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.</p><p>&mdash;He’s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O’. But hisheart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!</p><p>&mdash;Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I’ll soon be stretchedbeside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.</p><p>Breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in hiswalk. Mr Power took his arm.</p><p>&mdash;She’s better where she is, he said kindly.</p><p>&mdash;I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is inheaven if there is a heaven.</p><p>Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.</p><p>&mdash;Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.</p><p>Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.</p><p>&mdash;The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we cando so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.</p><p>They covered their heads.</p><p>&mdash;The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don’t you think? MrKernan said with reproof.</p><p>Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret eyes,secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We are the last.In the same boat. Hope he’ll say something else.</p><p>Mr Kernan added:</p><p>&mdash;The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, moreimpressive I must say.</p><p>Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.</p><p>Mr Kernan said with solemnity:</p><p>&mdash;<i>I am the resurrection and the life</i>. That touches a man’s inmostheart.</p><p>&mdash;It does, Mr Bloom said.</p><p>Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with histoes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections. Broken heart. Apump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day. One fine dayit gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of them lying around here: lungs,hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else. The resurrection and thelife. Once you are dead you are dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all upout of their graves. Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job.Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lightsand the rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweightof powder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.</p><p>Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side.</p><p>&mdash;Everything went off A1, he said. What?</p><p>He looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman’s shoulders. With yourtooraloom tooraloom.</p><p>&mdash;As it should be, Mr Kernan said.</p><p>&mdash;What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.</p><p>Mr Kernan assured him.</p><p>&mdash;Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I knowhis face.</p><p>Ned Lambert glanced back.</p><p>&mdash;Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.She’s his wife.</p><p>&mdash;O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven’t seen her for some time.She was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen goldenyears ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown. And a good armful she was.</p><p>He looked behind through the others.</p><p>&mdash;What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn’t he in the stationery line?I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.</p><p>Ned Lambert smiled.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely’s. A traveller for blottingpaper.</p><p>&mdash;In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon likethat for? She had plenty of game in her then.</p><p>&mdash;Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.</p><p>John Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead.</p><p>The barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the grasses,raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.</p><p>&mdash;John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.</p><p>Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:</p><p>&mdash;I am come to pay you another visit.</p><p>&mdash;My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don’t want yourcustom at all.</p><p>Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham’sside puzzling two long keys at his back.</p><p>&mdash;Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?</p><p>&mdash;I did not, Martin Cunningham said.</p><p>They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The caretakerhung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreettone to their vacant smiles.</p><p>&mdash;They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggyevening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for Mulcahyfrom the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsing about in thefog they found the grave sure enough. One of the drunks spelt out the name:Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour thewidow had got put up.</p><p>The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He resumed:</p><p>&mdash;And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, <i>Not a bloody bit likethe man</i>, says he. <i>That’s not Mulcahy</i>, says he, <i>whoever doneit</i>.</p><p>Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting thedockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.</p><p>&mdash;That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.</p><p>&mdash;I know, Hynes said. I know that.</p><p>&mdash;To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It’s pure goodheartedness:damn the thing else.</p><p>Mr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk. All want to be on good termswith him. Decent fellow, John O’Connell, real good sort. Keys: like Keyes’s ad:no fear of anyone getting out. No passout checks. <i>Habeas corpus</i>. I mustsee about that ad after the funeral. Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope Itook to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha? Hope it’s not chucked inthe dead letter office. Be the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That’sthe first sign when the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross. Silverthreads among the grey. Fancy being his wife.

The barrow had ceased to trundle.The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care roundthe graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink,looping the bands round it.</p><p>Burying him. We come to bury Cæsar. His ides of March or June. He doesn’t knowwho is here nor care.

They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and makesure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of acanvas airhole. Flag of distress. Three days. Rather long to keep them insummer. Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no.</p><p>The clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.</p><p>The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of it. Themourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show. MrBloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through themaze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.</p><p>Hynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he knows themall. No: coming to me.</p><p>&mdash;I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is yourchristian name? I’m not sure.</p><p>&mdash;L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M’Coy’s name too. Heasked me to.</p><p>&mdash;Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the <i>Freeman</i> once.</p><p>So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good idea apostmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He died of aTuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads. Charley, you’re mydarling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does no harm. I saw to that,M’Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave him under an obligation: costsnothing.</p><p>&mdash;And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was overthere in the...</p><p>He looked around.</p><p>&mdash;Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?</p><p>&mdash;M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don’t know who he is. Is that hisname?</p><p>He moved away, looking about him.</p><p>&mdash;No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!</p><p>Didn’t hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all the.Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good Lord, whatbecame of him?</p><p>A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.</p><p>&mdash;O, excuse me!</p><p>He stepped aside nimbly.</p><p>Clay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over. A moundof damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades. Alluncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped his wreath against acorner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The gravediggers put on their capsand carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. Then knocked the bladeslightly on the turf: clean. One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft ofgrass. One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, itsblade blueglancing. Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband.His navelcord. The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his freehand. Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. Foryourselves just.</p><p>The mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whilesto read a name on a tomb.</p><p>&mdash;Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said. We have time.</p><p>&mdash;Let us, Mr Power said.</p><p>They turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr Power’sblank voice spoke:</p><p>&mdash;Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled withstones. That one day he will come again.</p><p>Hynes shook his head.</p><p>&mdash;Parnell will never come again, he said. He’s there, all that was mortalof him. Peace to his ashes.</p><p>Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, brokenpillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland’shearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for theliving. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really? Plant him andhave done with him. Like down a coalshoot. Then lump them together to savetime. All souls’ day. Twentyseventh I’ll be at his grave. Ten shillings for thegardener. He keeps it free of weeds. Old man himself. Bent down double with hisshears clipping. Near death’s door. Who passed away. Who departed this life. Asif they did it of their own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked thebucket. More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So,wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the pound. Ora woman’s with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew. Eulogy in a countrychurchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or ThomasCampbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it. Old Dr Murren’s. The greatphysician called him home. Well it’s God’s acre for them. Nice countryresidence. Newly plastered and painted. Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke andread the <i>Church Times.</i> Marriage ads they never try to beautify. Rustywreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better value that for the money.Still, the flowers are more poetical. The other gets rather tiresome, neverwithering. Expresses nothing. Immortelles.</p><p>A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the weddingpresent alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him. Knows there areno catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder.

Ought to be sidewaysand red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was dedicated to it orwhatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this infliction? Would birdscome then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no becausethey ought to have been afraid of the boy. Apollo that was.</p><p>How many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed. As youare now so once were we.</p><p>Besides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the voice,yes: gramophone.

For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely’s.</p><p>Rtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!</p><p>He looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he goes.</p><p>An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles. Anold stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey alive crushed itselfin under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it. Good hidingplace fortreasure.</p><p>Who lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was buriedhere by torchlight, wasn’t he? Making his rounds.</p><p>Tail gone now.</p><p>One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones clean nomatter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat gone bad. Well andwhat’s cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that <i>Voyages in China</i> that theChinese say a white man smells like a corpse. Cremation better. Priests deadagainst it. Devilling for the other firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch ovendealers. Time of the plague. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber.Ashes to ashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten bybirds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See your wholelife in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can’t bury in the airhowever. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news go about whenever afresh one is let down. Underground communication. We learned that from them.Wouldn’t be surprised. Regular square feed for them. Flies come before he’swell dead. Got wind of Dignam. They wouldn’t care about the smell of it.Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.</p><p>The gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again. Enough ofthis place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I was here was MrsSinico’s funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills. And even scraping up theearth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buriedfemales or even putrefied with running gravesores. Give you the creeps after abit. I will appear to you after death. You will see my ghost after death. Myghost will haunt you after death. There is another world after death namedhell. I do not like that other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see andhear and feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in theirmaggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warmfullblooded life.</p><p>Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.</p><p>Solicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office. MatDillon’s long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars, theTantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out thatevening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke of mine:the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate at first sight. Mollyand Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that,mortified if women are by.</p><p>Got a dinge in the side of his hat.

He clapped the hat on his head again.</p><p>&mdash;It’s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.</p><p>John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.</p><p>&mdash;Thank you, he said shortly.</p><p>They walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few pacesso as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin could wind asappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.</p><p>Oyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.

Like these, got out of hand: fermenting. Working away, tearing away. Andthat old grey rat tearing to get in.</p><h4><b>HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT</b></h4><p>Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman’s spare body, admiring a glossy crown.</p><p>Strange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for Collegegreen. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was worth.

Long John is backing him, they say.</p><p>The foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet andmade a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently over the dirty glassscreen.</p><p>&mdash;Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.</p><p>Mr Bloom stood in his way.</p><p>&mdash;If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,pointing backward with his thumb.</p><p>&mdash;Did you?

Keyes, you remember?</p><p>Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.</p><p>&mdash;He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.</p><p>The foreman moved his pencil towards it.</p><p>&mdash;But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wantstwo keys at the top.</p><p>Hell of a racket they make. He doesn’t hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves.

Clank it. Clank it. Miles of it unreeled. Whatbecomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels: various uses, thousand and onethings.</p><p>Slipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew swiftly onthe scarred woodwork.</p><h4><b>HOUSE OF KEY(E)S</b></h4><p>&mdash;Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name.Alexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.</p><p>Better not teach him his own business.</p><p>&mdash;You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the top inleaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that’s a good idea?</p><p>The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched therequietly.</p><p>&mdash;The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor, theManx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from the isle ofMan. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?</p><p>I could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that <i>voglio.</i> But then ifhe didn’t know only make it awkward for him. Better not.</p><p>&mdash;We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?</p><p>&mdash;I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a housethere too. I’ll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that and just alittle par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass licensed premises.Longfelt want. So on.</p><p>The foreman thought for an instant.</p><p>&mdash;We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months’ renewal.</p><p>A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it silently. MrBloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching the silenttypesetters at their cases.</p><h4><b>ORTHOGRAPHICAL</b></h4><p>Want to be sure of his spelling. Proof fever. Martin Cunningham forgot to giveus his spellingbee conundrum this morning. It is amusing to view the unpar onear alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess ment of a harassed pedlar whilegauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled pear under a cemetery wall. Silly,isn’t it?

No. I could have said. Looks asgood as new now. See his phiz then.</p><p>Sllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its flyboard withsllt the first batch of quirefolded papers.

Tourists over for theshow.</p><h4><b>A DAYFATHER</b></h4><p>He walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed, spectacled,aproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he must have put throughhis hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs’ ads, speeches, divorce suits,found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now. Sober serious man with a bitin the savingsbank I’d say. Wife a good cook and washer. Daughter working themachine in the parlour. Plain Jane, no damn nonsense.</p><h4><b>AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER</b></h4><p>He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type. Reads itbackwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some practice that. mangiDkcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards with his finger tome. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear, O dear! All that long business aboutthat brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage<i>alleluia. Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu</i>. No, that’s the other. Then thetwelve brothers, Jacob’s sons. And then the lamb and the cat and the dog andthe stick and the water and the butcher. And then the angel of death kills thebutcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly tillyou come to look into it well. Justice it means but it’s everybody eatingeveryone else. That’s what life is after all. How quickly he does that job.Practice makes perfect. Seems to see with his fingers.</p><p>Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to thelanding. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch him outperhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as Citron’s house.Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four.</p><h4><b>ONLY ONCE MORE THAT SOAP</b></h4><p>He went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over those wallswith matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy smell therealways is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom’s next door when I was there.</p><p>He took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap I putthere. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his handkerchief he took outthe soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket of his trousers.</p><p>What perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram: something Iforgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.</p><p>A sudden screech of laughter came from the <i>Evening Telegraph</i> office.Know who that is. What’s up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert it is.</p><p>He entered softly.</p><h4><b>ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA</b></h4><p>&mdash;The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to thedusty windowpane.</p><p>Mr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert’s quizzing face,asked of it sourly:</p><p>&mdash;Agonising Christ, wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse?</p><p>Ned Lambert, seated on the table, read on:</p><p>&mdash;<i>Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles onits way, tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling waters ofNeptune’s blue domain, ’mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest zephyrs, played onby the glorious sunlight or ’neath the shadows cast o’er its pensive bosom bythe overarching leafage of the giants of the forest</i>. What about that,Simon? he asked over the fringe of his newspaper. How’s that for high?</p><p>&mdash;Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.</p><p>Ned Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:</p><p>&mdash;<i>The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage</i>. O boys!

I don’t want tohear any more of the stuff.</p><p>He ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and, hungered,made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.</p><p>High falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see. Ratherupsets a man’s day, a funeral does. He has influence they say. Old Chatterton,the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle.

The righthonourable Hedges Eyre Chatterton. Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque ortwo on gale days. Windfall when he kicks out. Alleluia.</p><p>&mdash;Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.</p><p>&mdash;What is it? Mr Bloom asked.</p><p>&mdash;A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answeredwith pomp of tone. <i>Our lovely land</i>.</p><h4><b>SHORT BUT TO THE POINT</b></h4><p>&mdash;Whose land?

Life is too short.</p><p>He took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache,welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.</p><p>Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An instantafter a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh’s unshavenblackspectacled face.</p><p>&mdash;Doughy Daw! he cried.</p><h4><b>WHAT WETHERUP SAID</b></h4><p>All very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot cakethat stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasn’t he? Why they call him DoughyDaw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged to that chap in theinland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that nicely. Entertainments. Openhouse. Big blowout. Wetherup always said that. Get a grip of them by thestomach.</p><p>The inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested by acomb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared about themand the harsh voice asked:</p><p>&mdash;What is it?</p><p>&mdash;And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.</p><p>&mdash;Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.</p><p>&mdash;Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink afterthat.</p><p>&mdash;Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.</p><p>&mdash;Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.</p><p>Ned Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor’s blue eyes roved towards MrBloom’s face, shadowed by a smile.</p><p>&mdash;Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked.</p><h4><b>MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED</b></h4><p>&mdash;North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. Wewon every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!</p><p>&mdash;Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at histoecaps.</p><p>&mdash;In Ohio! the editor shouted.</p><p>&mdash;So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.</p><p>Passing out he whispered to J. J. O’Molloy:</p><p>&mdash;Incipient jigs. Sad case.</p><p>&mdash;Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.My Ohio!</p><p>&mdash;A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long.</p><h4><b>O, HARP EOLIAN!</b></h4><p>He took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking off apiece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant unwashed teeth.</p><p>&mdash;Bingbang, bangbang.</p><p>Mr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.</p><p>&mdash;Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.</p><p>He went in.</p><p>&mdash;What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming tothe editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.</p><p>&mdash;That’ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret.Hello, Jack. That’s all right.</p><p>&mdash;Good day, Myles, J. J. O’Molloy said, letting the pages he held sliplimply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?</p><p>The telephone whirred inside.</p><p>&mdash;Twentyeight... No, twenty... Double four... Yes.</p><h4><b>SPOT THE WINNER</b></h4><p>Lenehan came out of the inner office with <i>Sport</i>’s tissues.</p><p>&mdash;Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O. Maddenup.</p><p>He tossed the tissues on to the table.</p><p>Screams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was flungopen.</p><p>&mdash;Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.</p><p>Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by thecollar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps. The tissuesrustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air blue scrawls and under thetable came to earth.</p><p>&mdash;It wasn’t me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.</p><p>&mdash;Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There’s a hurricaneblowing.</p><p>Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he stoopedtwice.</p><p>&mdash;Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was PatFarrell shoved me, sir.</p><p>He pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.</p><p>&mdash;Him, sir.</p><p>&mdash;Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.</p><p>He hustled the boy out and banged the door to.</p><p>J. J. O’Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:</p><p>&mdash;Continued on page six, column four.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, <i>Evening Telegraph</i> here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inneroffice. Is the boss...? Yes, <i>Telegraph</i>... To where? Aha! Which auctionrooms?... Aha! I see... Right. I’ll catch him.</p><h4><b>A COLLISION ENSUES</b></h4><p>The bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped againstLenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Pardon, monsieur</i>, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant andmaking a grimace.</p><p>&mdash;My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I’m in ahurry.</p><p>&mdash;Knee, Lenehan said.</p><p>He made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:</p><p>&mdash;The accumulation of the <i>anno Domini</i>.</p><p>&mdash;Sorry, Mr Bloom said.</p><p>He went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O’Molloy slapped theheavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan, echoed in thebare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:</p><p class="poem">We are the boys of Wexford<br/>Who fought with heart and hand.</p><h4><b>EXIT BLOOM</b></h4><p>&mdash;I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this adof Keyes’s. Want to fix it up. They tell me he’s round there in Dillon’s.</p><p>He looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who, leaningagainst the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand, suddenly stretchedforth an arm amply.</p><p>&mdash;Begone! he said. The world is before you.</p><p>&mdash;Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.</p><p>J. J. O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan’s hand and read them, blowing themapart gently, without comment.</p><p>&mdash;He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through hisblackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps after him.</p><p>&mdash;Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window.</p><h4><b>A STREET CORTÈGE</b></h4><p>Both smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr Bloom’swake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a tail of whitebowknots.</p><p>&mdash;Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, andyou’ll kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk. Smallnines. Steal upon larks.</p><p>He began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding feet pastthe fireplace to J. J. O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his receiving hands.</p><p>&mdash;What’s that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other twogone?</p><p>&mdash;Who? the professor said, turning. They’re gone round to the Oval for adrink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.</p><p>&mdash;Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where’s my hat?</p><p>He walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his jacket,jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the air and againstthe wood as he locked his desk drawer.</p><p>&mdash;He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.</p><p>&mdash;Seems to be, J. J. O’Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase inmurmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the mostmatches?</p><h4><b>THE CALUMET OF PEACE</b></h4><p>He offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan promptlystruck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J. J. O’Molloy openedhis case again and offered it.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Thanky vous</i>, Lenehan said, helping himself.</p><p>The editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. Hedeclaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:</p><p class="poem">’Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,<br/>’Twas empire charmed thy heart.</p><p>The professor grinned, locking his long lips.</p><p>&mdash;Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.</p><p>He took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him with quickgrace, said:</p><p>&mdash;Silence for my brandnew riddle!</p><p>&mdash;<i>Imperium romanum</i>, J. J. O’Molloy said gently. It sounds noblerthan British or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.</p><p>Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.</p><p>&mdash;That’s it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire.We haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell.</p><h4><b>THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME</b></h4><p>&mdash;Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. Wemustn’t be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome, imperial,imperious, imperative.</p><p>He extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:</p><p>&mdash;What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers.The Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: <i>It is meet to behere. Let us build an altar to Jehovah</i>. The Roman, like the Englishman whofollows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot(on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. He gazed about himin his toga and he said: <i>It is meet to be here. Let us construct awatercloset.</i></p><p>&mdash;Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient ancestors,as we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s, were partial to the runningstream.</p><p>&mdash;They were nature’s gentlemen, J. J. O’Molloy murmured. But we have alsoRoman law.</p><p>&mdash;And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.</p><p>&mdash;Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. O’Molloy asked.It was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going swimmingly ...</p><p>&mdash;First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?</p><p>Mr O’Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from thehallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Entrez, mes enfants!</i> Lenehan cried.</p><p>&mdash;I escort a suppliant, Mr O’Madden Burke said melodiously. Youth led byExperience visits Notoriety.</p><p>&mdash;How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Yourgovernor is just gone.</p><h4><b>???</b></h4><p>Lenehan said to all:</p><p>&mdash;Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline? Reflect, ponder,excogitate, reply.</p><p>Stephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and signature.</p><p>&mdash;Who? the editor asked.</p><p>Bit torn off.</p><p>&mdash;Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.</p><p>&mdash;That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken?</p><p class="poem">On swift sail flaming<br/>From storm and south<br/>He comes, pale vampire,<br/>Mouth to my mouth.</p><p>&mdash;Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over theirshoulders. Foot and mouth? Are you turned...?</p><p>Bullockbefriending bard.</p><h4><b>SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT</b></h4><p>&mdash;Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. The letter is not mine. MrGarrett Deasy asked me to...</p><p>&mdash;O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. Thebloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouthdisease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter’s face inthe Star and Garter. Oho!</p><p>A woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus,ten years the Greeks. O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.</p><p>&mdash;Is he a widower? Stephen asked.</p><p>&mdash;Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down thetypescript. Emperor’s horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on theramparts of Vienna. Don’t you forget! Maximilian Karl O’Donnell, graf vonTirconnell in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king an Austrianfieldmarshal now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild geese. O yes, everytime. Don’t you forget that!</p><p>&mdash;The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. O’Molloy said quietly, turninga horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thank you job.</p><p>Professor MacHugh turned on him.</p><p>&mdash;And if not? he said.</p><p>&mdash;I’ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. A Hungarian it was oneday...</p><h4><b>LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED</b></h4><p>&mdash;We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for usis the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never loyal tothe successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin language. I speak thetongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is the maxim: time is money.Material domination. <i>Dominus!</i> Lord! Where is the spirituality? LordJesus? Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend club. But the Greek!</p><h4><b>KYRIE ELEISON!</b></h4><p>A smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long lips.</p><p>&mdash;The Greek! he said again. <i>Kyrios!</i> Shining word! The vowels theSemite and the Saxon know not. <i>Kyrie!</i> The radiance of the intellect. Iought to profess Greek, the language of the mind. <i>Kyrie eleison!</i> Theclosetmaker and the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit. We are liegesubjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar and ofthe empire of the spirit, not an <i>imperium,</i> that went under with theAthenian fleets at Aegospotami. Yes, yes. They went under. Pyrrhus, misled byan oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of Greece. Loyal to alost cause.</p><p>He strode away from them towards the window.</p><p>&mdash;They went forth to battle, Mr O’Madden Burke said greyly, but theyalways fell.</p><p>&mdash;Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received inthe latter half of the <i>matinée</i>. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!</p><p>He whispered then near Stephen’s ear:</p><h4><b>LENEHAN’S LIMERICK</b></h4><p>&mdash;<i>There’s a ponderous pundit MacHugh<br/>Who wears goggles of ebony hue.<br/>As he mostly sees double<br/>To wear them why trouble?<br/>I can’t see the Joe Miller. Can you?</i><br/><br/></p><p>In mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.</p><p>Myles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.</p><p>&mdash;That’ll be all right, he said. I’ll read the rest after. That’ll be allright.</p><p>Lenehan extended his hands in protest.</p><p>&mdash;But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railwayline?</p><p>&mdash;Opera? Mr O’Madden Burke’s sphinx face reriddled.</p><p>Lenehan announced gladly:</p><p>&mdash;<i>The Rose of Castile</i>. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!</p><p>He poked Mr O’Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O’Madden Burke fell backwith grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.</p><p>&mdash;Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.</p><p>Lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling tissues.</p><p>The professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across Stephen’sand Mr O’Madden Burke’s loose ties.</p><p>&mdash;Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.</p><p>&mdash;Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. J. O’Molloy said in quietmockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you? Youlook as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff.</p><h4><b>OMNIUM GATHERUM</b></h4><p>&mdash;We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.</p><p>&mdash;All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics...</p><p>&mdash;The turf, Lenehan put in.</p><p>&mdash;Literature, the press.</p><p>&mdash;If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of advertisement.</p><p>&mdash;And Madam Bloom, Mr O’Madden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublin’s primefavourite.</p><p>Lenehan gave a loud cough.</p><p>&mdash;Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a coldin the park. The gate was open.</p><h4><b>“YOU CAN DO IT!”</b></h4><p>The editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen’s shoulder.</p><p>&mdash;I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite init. You can do it. I see it in your face. <i>In the lexicon of youth</i>...</p><p>See it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.</p><p>&mdash;Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Greatnationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the public! Givethem something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn its soul. Father,Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M’Carthy.</p><p>&mdash;We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O’Madden Burke said.</p><p>Stephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.</p><p>&mdash;He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. O’Molloy said.</p><h4><b>THE GREAT GALLAHER</b></h4><p>&mdash;You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.Wait a minute. We’ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say when hewas on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence. Gallaher, thatwas a pressman for you. That was a pen. You know how he made his mark? I’lltell you. That was the smartest piece of journalism ever known. That was ineightyone, sixth of May, time of the invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park,before you were born, I suppose. I’ll show you.</p><p>He pushed past them to the files.</p><p>&mdash;Look at here, he said turning. The <i>New York World</i> cabled for aspecial. Remember that time?</p><p>Professor MacHugh nodded.</p><p>&mdash;<i>New York World</i>, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his strawhat. Where it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Joe Brady and the restof them. Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Whole route, see?</p><p>&mdash;Skin-the-Goat, Mr O’Madden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has that cabman’sshelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me. You knowHolohan?</p><p>&mdash;Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.</p><p>&mdash;And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for thecorporation. A night watchman.</p><p>Stephen turned in surprise.</p><p>&mdash;Gumley? he said. You don’t say so? A friend of my father’s, is it?</p><p>&mdash;Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mind thestones, see they don’t run away. Look at here. What did Ignatius Gallaher do?I’ll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away. Have you <i>WeeklyFreeman</i> of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?</p><p>He flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.</p><p>&mdash;Take page four, advertisement for Bransome’s coffee, let us say. Haveyou got that? Right.</p><p>The telephone whirred.</p><h4><b>A DISTANT VOICE</b></h4><p>&mdash;I’ll answer it, the professor said, going.</p><p>&mdash;B is parkgate. Good.</p><p>His finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.</p><p>&mdash;T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroongate.</p><p>The loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock’s wattles. An illstarched dickyjutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his waistcoat.</p><p>&mdash;Hello? <i>Evening Telegraph</i> here... Hello?... Who’s there?... Yes...Yes... Yes.</p><p>&mdash;F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi, Inchicore,Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F.A.B.P. Got that? X isDavy’s publichouse in upper Leeson street.</p><p>The professor came to the inner door.</p><p>&mdash;Bloom is at the telephone, he said.</p><p>&mdash;Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Davy’s publichouse,see?</p><h4><b>CLEVER, VERY</b></h4><p>&mdash;Clever, Lenehan said. Very.</p><p>&mdash;Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloodyhistory.</p><p>Nightmare from which you will never awake.</p><p>&mdash;I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, thebesthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and myself.</p><p>Lenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:</p><p>&mdash;Madam, I’m Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.</p><p>&mdash;History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Prince’s street wasthere first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of anadvertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the leg up.Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the <i>Star.</i> Now he’sgot in with Blumenfeld. That’s press. That’s talent. Pyatt! He was all theirdaddies!</p><p>&mdash;The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and thebrother-in-law of Chris Callinan.</p><p>&mdash;Hello?... Are you there?... Yes, he’s here still. Come across yourself.</p><p>&mdash;Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried.</p><p>He flung the pages down.</p><p>&mdash;Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O’Madden Burke.</p><p>&mdash;Very smart, Mr O’Madden Burke said.</p><p>Professor MacHugh came from the inner office.</p><p>&mdash;Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkerswere up before the recorder...</p><p>&mdash;O yes, J. J. O’Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home throughthe park to see all the trees that were blown down by that cyclone last yearand thought she’d buy a view of Dublin. And it turned out to be a commemorationpostcard of Joe Brady or Number One or Skin-the-Goat. Right outside theviceregal lodge, imagine!</p><p>&mdash;They’re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said. Psha!Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those fellows, likeWhiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O’Hagan. Eh? Ah, bloodynonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.</p><p>His mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.</p><p>Would anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why did you writeit then?</p><h4><b>RHYMES AND REASONS</b></h4><p>Mouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth? Must be some.South, pout, out, shout, drouth.

J. O’Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.</p><p>&mdash;My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a falseconstruction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised, for the thirdprofession <i>qua</i> profession but your Cork legs are running away with you.Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke?Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of thefarthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not tomention <i>Paddy Kelly’s Budget</i>, <i>Pue’s Occurrences</i> and our watchfulfriend <i>The Skibbereen Eagle</i>. Why bring in a master of forensic eloquencelike Whiteside? Sufficient for the day is the newspaper thereof.</p><h4><b>LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE</b></h4><p>&mdash;Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in hisface. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established 1763. Dr Lucas. Who haveyou now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!</p><p>&mdash;Well, J. J. O’Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.</p><p>&mdash;Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it inhis blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.</p><p>&mdash;He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for.... But no matter.</p><p>J. J. O’Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:</p><p>&mdash;One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my lifefell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide, theChilds murder case. Bushe defended him.</p><p class="poem"><i>And in the porches of mine ear did pour.</i></p><p>By the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the other story,beast with two backs?</p><p>&mdash;What was that? the professor asked.</p><h4><b>ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM</b></h4><p>&mdash;He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. O’Molloy said, of Roman justiceas contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the <i>lex talionis</i>. And hecited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.</p><p>&mdash;Ha.</p><p>&mdash;A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!</p><p>Pause. J. J. O’Molloy took out his cigarettecase.</p><p>False lull. Something quite ordinary.</p><p>Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.</p><p>I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it wasthat small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match, that determinedthe whole aftercourse of both our lives.</p><h4><b>A POLISHED PERIOD</b></h4><p>J. J. O’Molloy resumed, moulding his words:</p><p>&mdash;He said of it: <i>that stony effigy in frozen music, horned andterrible, of the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and ofprophecy which, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor haswrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves tolive, deserves to live.</i></p><p>His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.</p><p>&mdash;Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.</p><p>&mdash;The divine afflatus, Mr O’Madden Burke said.</p><p>&mdash;You like it? J. J. O’Molloy asked Stephen.</p><p>Stephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. He took acigarette from the case. J. J. O’Molloy offered his case to Myles Crawford.Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy, saying:</p><p>&mdash;Muchibus thankibus.</p><h4><b>A MAN OF HIGH MORALE</b></h4><p>&mdash;Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O’Molloy said toStephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets:A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it. She was a nice old bagof tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer that you came to himin the small hours of the morning to ask him about planes of consciousness.Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A. E.’s leg. He is a man of the veryhighest morale, Magennis.</p><p>Speaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say about me?Don’t ask.</p><p>&mdash;No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside. Waita moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I ever heard wasa speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society. Mr JusticeFitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had spoken and the paper underdebate was an essay (new for those days), advocating the revival of the Irishtongue.</p><p>He turned towards Myles Crawford and said:</p><p>&mdash;You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of hisdiscourse.</p><p>&mdash;He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O’Molloy said, rumour has it, on theTrinity college estates commission.</p><p>&mdash;He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’sfrock. Go on. Well?</p><p>&mdash;It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not saythe vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely upon the newmovement. It was then a new movement. We were weak, therefore worthless.</p><p>He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised anoutspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and ringfingertouching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new focus.</p><h4><b>IMPROMPTU</b></h4><p>In ferial tone he addressed J. J. O’Molloy:</p><p>&mdash;Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he hadprepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriterin the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it. He worea loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked (though he was not) adying man.</p><p>His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O’Molloy’s towards Stephen’s faceand then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His unglazed linen collarappeared behind his bent head, soiled by his withering hair. Still seeking, hesaid:</p><p>&mdash;When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply. Briefly,as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.</p><p>He raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more. Witlessshellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.</p><p>He began:</p><p><i>&mdash;Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration inlistening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by mylearned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country faraway from this country, into an age remote from this age, that I stood inancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of thatland addressed to the youthful Moses.</i></p><p>His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes ascending infrail stalks that flowered with his speech. <i>And let our crooked smokes.</i>Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand at it yourself?</p><p><i>&mdash;And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptianhighpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard hiswords and their meaning was revealed to me.</i></p><h4><b>FROM THE FATHERS</b></h4><p>It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted whichneither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could becorrupted. Ah, curse you! That’s saint Augustine.</p><p><i>&mdash;Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and ourlanguage? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. You haveno cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys,trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters ofthe known globe. You have but emerged from primitive conditions: we have aliterature, a priesthood, an agelong history and a polity.</i></p><p>Nile.</p><p>Child, man, effigy.</p><p>By the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple incombat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.</p><p><i>&mdash;You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic andmysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra. Yoursserfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Israel is weak and feware her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms. Vagrants anddaylabourers are you called: the world trembles at our name.</i></p><p>A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it boldly:</p><p><i>&mdash;But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to andaccepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowedhis spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought thechosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed the pillar of thecloud by day. He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings onSinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspirationshining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law,graven in the language of the outlaw.</i></p><p>He ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence.</p><h4><b>OMINOUS&mdash;FOR HIM!</b></h4><p>J. J. O’Molloy said not without regret:</p><p>&mdash;And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.</p><p>&mdash;A&mdash;sudden&mdash;at&mdash;the&mdash;moment&mdash;though&mdash;from&mdash;lingering&mdash;illness&mdash;often&mdash;previously&mdash;expectorated&mdash;demise, Lenehan added. And with a great future behind him.</p><p>The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up thestaircase.</p><p>&mdash;That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted. </p><p>Gone with the wind. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles of earsof porches. The tribune’s words, howled and scattered to the four winds. Apeople sheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic records of all that everanywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me no more.</p><p>I have money.</p><p>&mdash;Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may Isuggest that the house do now adjourn?</p><p>&mdash;You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment? MrO’Madden Burke asked. ’Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug, metaphoricallyspeaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.</p><p>&mdash;That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All that are in favour sayay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To whichparticular boosing shed...? My casting vote is: Mooney’s!</p><p>He led the way, admonishing:</p><p>&mdash;We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? Yes, wewill not. By no manner of means.</p><p>Mr O’Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally’s lunge of his umbrella:</p><p>&mdash;Lay on, Macduff!</p><p>&mdash;Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on theshoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?</p><p>He fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.</p><p>&mdash;Foot and mouth. I know. That’ll be all right. That’ll go in. Where arethey? That’s all right.</p><p>He thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office.</p><h4><b>LET US HOPE</b></h4><p>J. J. O’Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:</p><p>&mdash;I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.</p><p>He went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.</p><p>&mdash;Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isn’t it? It hasthe prophetic vision. <i>Fuit Ilium!</i> The sack of windy Troy. Kingdoms ofthis world. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.</p><p>The first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and rushed outinto the street, yelling:</p><p>&mdash;Racing special!</p><p>Dublin. I have much, much to learn.</p><p>They turned to the left along Abbey street.</p><p>&mdash;I have a vision too, Stephen said.</p><p>&mdash;Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford willfollow.</p><p>Another newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:</p><p>&mdash;Racing special!</p><h4><b>DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN</b></h4><p>Dubliners.</p><p>&mdash;Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fiftyand fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane.</p><p>&mdash;Where is that? the professor asked.</p><p>&mdash;Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.</p><p>Damp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face glistering tallowunder her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records. Quicker, darlint!</p><p>On now. Dare it. Let there be life.</p><p>&mdash;They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar.They save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. They shake outthe threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies with the blade of aknife. Two and three in silver and one and seven in coppers. They put on theirbonnets and best clothes and take their umbrellas for fear it may come on torain.</p><p>&mdash;Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said.</p><h4><b>LIFE ON THE RAW</b></h4><p>&mdash;They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf atthe north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins,proprietress... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at thefoot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. They give twothreepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin to waddle slowly upthe winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each other, afraid of the dark,panting, one asking the other have you the brawn, praising God and the BlessedVirgin, threatening to come down, peeping at the airslits. Glory be to God.They had no idea it was that high.</p><p>Their names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the lumbagofor which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got a bottlefulfrom a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen and a bottle ofdouble X for supper every Saturday.</p><p>&mdash;Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can seethem. What’s keeping our friend?</p><p>He turned.</p><p>A bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in alldirections, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them MylesCrawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet face, talkingwith J. J. O’Molloy.</p><p>&mdash;Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.</p><p>He set off again to walk by Stephen’s side.</p><h4><b>RETURN OF BLOOM</b></h4><p>&mdash;Yes, he said. I see them.</p><p>Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the offices ofthe <i>Irish Catholic</i> and <i>Dublin Penny Journal</i>, called:</p><p>&mdash;Mr Crawford! A moment!</p><p>&mdash;<i>Telegraph</i>! Racing special!</p><p>&mdash;What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.</p><p>A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face:</p><p>&mdash;Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!</p><h4><b>INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR</b></h4><p>&mdash;Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing,and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyes just now. He’llgive a renewal for two months, he says. After he’ll see. But he wants a par tocall attention in the <i>Telegraph</i> too, the Saturday pink. And he wants itcopied if it’s not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the <i>KilkennyPeople</i>. I can have access to it in the national library. House of keys,don’t you see? His name is Keyes. It’s a play on the name. But he practicallypromised he’d give the renewal. But he wants just a little puff. What will Itell him, Mr Crawford?</p><h4><b>K.M.A.</b></h4><p>&mdash;Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing outhis arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.</p><p>A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm. Lenehan’syachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder is that young Dedalusthe moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on him today. Last time I saw himhe had his heels on view. Been walking in muck somewhere. Careless chap. Whatwas he doing in Irishtown?</p><p>&mdash;Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design Isuppose it’s worth a short par. He’d give the ad, I think. I’ll tell him...</p><h4><b>K.M.R.I.A.</b></h4><p>&mdash;He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over hisshoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.</p><p>While Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode onjerkily.</p><h4><b>RAISING THE WIND</b></h4><p>&mdash;<i>Nulla bona</i>, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I’m upto here. I’ve been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to backa bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take the will forthe deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow.</p><p>J. J. O’Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught up on theothers and walked abreast.</p><p>&mdash;When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twentyfingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings.</p><p>&mdash;Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two oldDublin women on the top of Nelson’s pillar.</p><h4><b>SOME COLUMN!&mdash;THAT’S WHAT WADDLER ONE SAID</b></h4><p>&mdash;That’s new, Myles Crawford said. That’s copy. Out for the waxies’Dargle. Two old trickies, what?</p><p>&mdash;But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see theroofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines’ blue dome,Adam and Eve’s, saint Laurence O’Toole’s. But it makes them giddy to look sothey pull up their skirts...</p><h4><b>THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS FEMALES</b></h4><p>&mdash;Easy all, Myles Crawford said. No poetic licence. We’re in thearchdiocese here.</p><p>&mdash;And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue ofthe onehandled adulterer.</p><p>&mdash;Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the idea.I see what you mean.</p><h4><b>DAMES DONATE DUBLIN’S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS AEROLITHS, BELIEF</b></h4><p>&mdash;It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are tootired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums between themand eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with theirhandkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting theplumstones slowly out between the railings.</p><p>He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr O’Madden Burke,hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney’s.</p><p>&mdash;Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse.</p><h4><b>SOPHIST WALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS. SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS.ITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.</b></h4><p>&mdash;You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of Gorgias,the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he were bitterer againstothers or against himself. He was the son of a noble and a bondwoman. And hewrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen andhanded it to poor Penelope.</p><p>Poor Penelope. Penelope Rich.</p><p>They made ready to cross O’Connell street.</p><h4><b>HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!</b></h4><p>At various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless trolleys stoodin their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines, Rathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstownand Dalkey, Sandymount Green, Ringsend and Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook,Palmerston Park and Upper Rathmines, all still, becalmed in short circuit.Hackney cars, cabs, delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams, aeratedmineral water floats with rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled,horsedrawn, rapidly.</p><h4><b>WHAT?&mdash;AND LIKEWISE&mdash;WHERE?</b></h4><p>&mdash;But what do you call it? Myles Crawford asked. Where did they get theplums?</p><h4><b>VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE. SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.</b></h4><p>&mdash;Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide toreflect. Call it, let me see. Call it: <i>deus nobis hæc otia fecit.</i></p><p>&mdash;No, Stephen said. I call it <i>A Pisgah Sight of Palestine</i> or <i>TheParable of The Plums.</i></p><p>&mdash;I see, the professor said.</p><p>He laughed richly.</p><p>&mdash;I see, he said again with new pleasure. Moses and the promised land. Wegave him that idea, he added to J. J. O’Molloy.</p><h4><b>HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS FAIR JUNE DAY</b></h4><p>J. J. O’Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held hispeace.</p><p>&mdash;I see, the professor said.</p><p>He halted on sir John Gray’s pavement island and peered aloft at Nelson throughthe meshes of his wry smile.</p><h4><b>DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO TITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS. ANNE WIMBLES, FLOWANGLES&mdash;YET CAN YOU BLAME THEM?</b></h4><p>&mdash;Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. That tickles me, I mustsay.</p><p>&mdash;Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty’struth was known.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="chap08"></a>[ 8 ]</h3><p>Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch.

Funeral was this morning.</p><p class="poem">Your funeral’s tomorrow<br/>While you’re coming through the rye.<br/>Diddlediddle dumdum<br/>Diddlediddle...</p><p>&mdash;Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen’s womaneyes said melancholily.</p><p>Now that’s quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.</p><p>&mdash;And your lord and master?</p><p>Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn’t lost them anyhow.</p><p>&mdash;O, don’t be talking! she said. He’s a caution to rattlesnakes. He’s inthere now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has meheartscalded. Wait till I show you.</p><p>Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out fromHarrison’s. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom’s gullet. Want tomake good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they’d taste it withthe hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot arab stood over the grating,breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way. Pleasure or pain isit? Penny dinner. Knife and fork chained to the table.</p><p>Opening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on thosethings. Stick it in a chap’s eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open. Money. Pleasetake one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain. Husband barging. Where’sthe ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are you feeding your little brother’sfamily? Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What isshe?...</p><p>&mdash;There must be a new moon out, she said. He’s always bad then. Do youknow what he did last night?</p><p>Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm,yet smiling.</p><p>&mdash;What? Mr Bloom asked.</p><p>Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.</p><p>&mdash;Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.</p><p>Indiges.</p><p>&mdash;Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.</p><p>&mdash;The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.</p><p>She took a folded postcard from her handbag.</p><p>&mdash;Read that, she said. He got it this morning.</p><p>&mdash;What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U. P.?</p><p>&mdash;U. p: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It’s a great shamefor them whoever he is.</p><p>&mdash;Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.</p><p>She took back the card, sighing.</p><p>&mdash;And now he’s going round to Mr Menton’s office. He’s going to take anaction for ten thousand pounds, he says.</p><p>She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.</p><p>Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its bestdays. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three old grapes totake the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a tasty dresser. Linesround her mouth. Only a year or so older than Molly.</p><p>See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.</p><p>He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent. Pungentmockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I’m hungry too. Flakes of pastry on the gussetof her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek. Rhubarb tart withliberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie Powell that was. In Luke Doyle’slong ago. Dolphin’s Barn, the charades. U. p: up.</p><p>Change the subject.</p><p>&mdash;Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.</p><p>&mdash;Mina Purefoy? she said.</p><p>Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers’ Club. Matcham often thinks of themasterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.</p><p>&mdash;Yes.</p><p>&mdash;I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She’s in the lying-inhospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She’s three days bad now.</p><p>&mdash;O, Mr Bloom said. I’m sorry to hear that.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It’s a very stiffbirth, the nurse told me.</p><p>&mdash;O, Mr Bloom said.</p><p>His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in compassion.Dth! Dth!</p><p>&mdash;I’m sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That’s terriblefor her.</p><p>Mrs Breen nodded.</p><p>&mdash;She was taken bad on the Tuesday...</p><p>Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:</p><p>&mdash;Mind! Let this man pass.</p><p>A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gazeinto the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a skullpiece a tinyhat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat, a stick and an umbrelladangled to his stride.</p><p>&mdash;Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch!</p><p>&mdash;Who is he if it’s a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?</p><p>&mdash;His name is Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloomsaid smiling. Watch!</p><p>&mdash;He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of thesedays.</p><p>She broke off suddenly.</p><p>&mdash;There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me toMolly, won’t you?</p><p>&mdash;I will, Mr Bloom said.</p><p>He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen inskimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison’s hugging twoheavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay. Like old times. He suffered herto overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her,his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.</p><p>Meshuggah. Off his chump.</p><p>Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tightskullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two days. Watch him!Out he goes again. One way of getting on in the world. And that other old moseylunatic in those duds. Hard time she must have with him.</p><p>U. p: up. I’ll take my oath that’s Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding.

Oyes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that sold me her old wraps and black underclothes inthe Shelbourne hotel. Divorced Spanish American. Didn’t take a feather out ofher my handling them. As if I was her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregalparty when Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the <i>Express.</i>Scavenging what the quality left. High tea.

That horsepoliceman theday Joe Chamberlain was given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money.My word he did! His horse’s hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. LuckyI had the presence of mind to dive into Manning’s or I was souped. He did comea wallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on the cobblestones. Ioughtn’t to have got myself swept along with those medicals. And the Trinityjibs in their mortarboards. Looking for trouble.

Trams passed one another, ingoing, outgoing, clanging.Useless words. Things go on same, day after day: squads of police marching out,back: trams in, out. Those two loonies mooching about. Dignam carted off. MinaPurefoy swollen belly on a bed groaning to have a child tugged out of her. Oneborn every second somewhere. Other dying every second. Since I fed the birdsfive minutes. Three hundred kicked the bucket.

Charley Kavanagh used to come out on his high horse, cocked hat,puffed, powdered and shaved. Look at the woebegone walk of him. Eaten a badegg. Poached eyes on ghost. I have a pain. Great man’s brother: his brother’sbrother. He’d look nice on the city charger. Drop into the D.B.C. probably forhis coffee, play chess there. His brother used men as pawns. Let them all go topot. Afraid to pass a remark on him. Freeze them up with that eye of his.That’s the fascination: the name. All a bit touched. Mad Fanny and his othersister Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness. Bolt upright likesurgeon M’Ardle. Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath. Apply for theChiltern Hundreds and retire into public life. The patriot’s banquet. Eatingorangepeels in the park.

Yes: completely. Thetip of his little finger blotted out the sun’s disk. Must be the focus wherethe rays cross. If I had black glasses. Interesting.

I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex. Clergymen’sdiscussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal to us ideas,formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a work of art is out ofhow deep a life does it spring. The painting of Gustave Moreau is the paintingof ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley, the words of Hamlet bring our mindsinto contact with the eternal wisdom, Plato’s world of ideas. All the rest isthe speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys.</p><p>A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike me!</p><p>&mdash;The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.Aristotle was once Plato’s schoolboy.</p><p>&mdash;And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. Onecan see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.</p><p>He laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.</p><p>Formless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath.

He bore in his hand with grace anotebook, new, large, clean, bright.</p><p>&mdash;That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet’s musings aboutthe afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant andundramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato’s.</p><p>John Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:</p><p>&mdash;Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotlewith Plato.</p><p>&mdash;Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from hiscommonwealth?</p><p>Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of allhorse.Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the street: veryperipatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see.

Hold to the now, thehere, through which all future plunges to the past.</p><p>Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.</p><p>&mdash;Haines is gone, he said.</p><p>&mdash;Is he?</p><p>&mdash;I was showing him Jubainville’s book. He’s quite enthusiastic, don’t youknow, about Hyde’s <i>Lovesongs of Connacht.</i> I couldn’t bring him in tohear the discussion. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy it.</p><p class="poem">Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick<br/>To greet the callous public.<br/>Writ, I ween, ’twas not my wish<br/>In lean unlovely English.</p><p>&mdash;The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.</p><p>We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green twinklingstone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.</p><p>&mdash;People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg ofRussell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the world areborn out of the dreams and visions in a peasant’s heart on the hillside. Forthem the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother. The rarefiedair of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel, the musichallsong. France produces the finest flower of corruption in Mallarmé but thedesirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart, the life of Homer’sPhæacians.</p><p>From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.</p><p>&mdash;Mallarmé, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prosepoems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about<i>Hamlet.</i> He says: <i>il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même</i>,don’t you know, <i>reading the book of himself</i>. He describes <i>Hamlet</i>given in a French town, don’t you know, a provincial town.

Excellent people, no doubt, butdistressingly shortsighted in some matters.</p><p>Sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.</p><p>&mdash;A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not fornothing was he a butcher’s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting inhis palms. Nine lives are taken off for his father’s one. Our Father who art inpurgatory. Khaki Hamlets don’t hesitate to shoot. The bloodboltered shambles inact five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.</p><p>Cranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.</p><p class="poem">Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none<br/>But we had spared...</p><p>Between the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.</p><p>&mdash;He will have it that <i>Hamlet</i> is a ghoststory, John Eglinton saidfor Mr Best’s behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our fleshcreep.</p><p class="poem">List! List! O List!</p><p>My flesh hears him: creeping, hears.</p><p class="poem">If thou didst ever...</p><p>&mdash;What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has fadedinto impalpability through death, through absence, through change of manners.Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virginDublin. Who is the ghost from <i>limbo patrum</i>, returning to the world thathas forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?</p><p>John Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.</p><p>Lifted.</p><p>&mdash;It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a swiftglance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside. The bearSackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden. Canvasclimbers who sailedwith Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings.</p><p>Local colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.</p><p>&mdash;Shakespeare has left the huguenot’s house in Silver street and walks bythe swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the pen chivyingher game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has other thoughts.</p><p>Composition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!</p><p>&mdash;The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in thecastoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the ghost,the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who has studied<i>Hamlet</i> all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to playthe part of the spectre. He speaks the words to Burbage, the young player whostands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth, calling him by a name:</p><p class="poem">Hamlet, I am thy father’s spirit,</p><p>bidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince, youngHamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has died inStratford that his namesake may live for ever.</p><p>Is it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in thevesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words to his ownson’s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet’stwin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that he did not draw orforesee the logical conclusion of those premises: you are the dispossessed son:I am the murdered father: your mother is the guilty queen, Ann Shakespeare,born Hathaway?</p><p>&mdash;But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell beganimpatiently.</p><p>Art thou there, truepenny?</p><p>&mdash;Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I meanwhen we read the poetry of <i>King Lear</i> what is it to us how the poetlived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l’Isle hassaid. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the poet’s drinking,the poet’s debts. We have <i>King Lear</i>: and it is immortal.</p><p>Mr Best’s face, appealed to, agreed.</p><p class="poem">Flow over them with your waves and with your waters,<br/>Mananaan, Mananaan MacLir...</p><p>How now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?</p><p>Marry, I wanted it.</p><p>Take thou this noble.</p><p>Go to!

I.</p><p>A.E.I.O.U.</p><p>&mdash;Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries? JohnEglinton’s carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid for ever. Shedied, for literature at least, before she was born.</p><p>&mdash;She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She sawhim into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She bore hischildren and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when helay on his deathbed.</p><p>Mother’s deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into this worldlies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. <i>Liliata rutilantium.</i></p><p>I wept alone.</p><p>John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.</p><p>&mdash;The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got outof it as quickly and as best he could.</p><p>&mdash;Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His errorsare volitional and are the portals of discovery.</p><p>Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian, softcreakfooted,bald, eared and assiduous.</p><p>&mdash;A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal ofdiscovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn fromXanthippe?</p><p>&mdash;Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughtsinto the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (<i>absit nomen!</i>),Socratididion’s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know. But neitherthe midwife’s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of SinnFein and their naggin of hemlock.</p><p>&mdash;But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best’s quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seemto be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.</p><p>His look went from brooder’s beard to carper’s skull, to remind, to chide themnot unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless though maligned.</p><p>&mdash;He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory. Hecarried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling <i>The girlI left behind me.</i> If the earthquake did not time it we should know where toplace poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds, the studded bridle andher blue windows. That memory, <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, lay in the bedchamberof every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured? Hortensiocalls her young and beautiful. Do you think the writer of <i>Antony andCleopatra</i>, a passionate pilgrim, had his eyes in the back of his head thathe chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left herand gained the world of men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy. Theirlife, thought, speech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He was chosen, itseems to me. If others have their will Ann hath a way. By cock, she was toblame. She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix. The greyeyed goddesswho bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue to the swellingact, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover youngerthan herself.</p><p>And my turn? When?</p><p>Come!</p><p>&mdash;Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,brightly.</p><p>He murmured then with blond delight for all:</p><p class="poem">Between the acres of the rye<br/>These pretty countryfolk would lie.</p><p>Paris: the wellpleased pleaser.</p><p>A tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its cooperativewatch.</p><p>&mdash;I am afraid I am due at the <i>Homestead.</i></p><p>Whither away? Exploitable ground.</p><p>&mdash;Are you going? John Eglinton’s active eyebrows asked. Shall we see youat Moore’s tonight? Piper is coming.</p><p>&mdash;Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?</p><p>Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.</p><p>&mdash;I don’t know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get awayin time.</p><p>Yogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. <i>Isis Unveiled.</i> Their Pali book we triedto pawn.

Did you hear Miss Mitchell’s joke about Mooreand Martyn? That Moore is Martyn’s wild oats? Awfully clever, isn’t it? Theyremind one of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.

Blushing, his mask said:</p><p>&mdash;Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.</p><p>He creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine,and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:</p><p>&mdash;Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?</p><p>Alarmed face asks me. Why did he come?

And in New Place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely,once as sweet, as fresh as cinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare,frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven.</p><p>&mdash;Yes.

Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of death isin them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak their will.</p><p>&mdash;Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the mostenigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so much.Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.</p><p>&mdash;But <i>Hamlet</i> is so personal, isn’t it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, akind of private paper, don’t you know, of his private life. I mean, I don’tcare a button, don’t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...</p><p>He rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his defiance. Hisprivate papers in the original. <i>Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim in mo shagart</i>.Put beurla on it, littlejohn.</p><p>Quoth littlejohn Eglinton:</p><p>&mdash;I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but Imay as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare isHamlet you have a stern task before you.</p><p>Bear with me.</p><p>Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkledbrows. A basilisk. <i>E quando vede l’uomo l’attosca</i>. Messer Brunetto, Ithank thee for the word.</p><p>&mdash;As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said, fromday to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist weave andunweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when Iwas born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time, sothrough the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looksforth. In the intense instant of imagination, when the mind, Shelley says, is afading coal, that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibilityI may come to be. So in the future, the sister of the past, I may see myself asI sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be.</p><p>Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitternessmight be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son.</p><p>Has the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.</p><p>&mdash;That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.</p><p>John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.</p><p>&mdash;If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a drug inthe market. The plays of Shakespeare’s later years which Renan admired so muchbreathe another spirit.</p><p>&mdash;The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.</p><p>&mdash;There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been asundering.</p><p>Said that.</p><p>&mdash;If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over thehell of time of <i>King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,</i> lookto see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a man,shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles, prince ofTyre?</p><p>Head, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.</p><p>&mdash;A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.</p><p>&mdash;The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constantquantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead to thetown.</p><p>Good Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon’s wild oats. Cypherjugglers going thehighroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town, good masters? Mummed innames: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the sun, west of the moon:<i>Tir na n-og</i>. Booted the twain and staved.</p><p class="poem">How many miles to Dublin?<br/>Three score and ten, sir.<br/>Will we be there by candlelight?</p><p>&mdash;Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closingperiod.</p><p>&mdash;Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver hisname is, say of it?</p><p>&mdash;Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita, thatwhich was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter’s child. <i>Mydearest wife</i>, Pericles says, <i>was like this maid.</i> Will any man lovethe daughter if he has not loved the mother?</p><p>&mdash;The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. <i>L’art d’êtregrand</i>...</p><p>&mdash;Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,another image?</p><p>Do you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all men.<i>Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus ...</i></p><p>&mdash;His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard ofall experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The imagesof other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them grotesqueattempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.</p><p>The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.</p><p>&mdash;I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of thepublic. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George BernardShaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles on Shakespeare in the<i>Saturday Review</i> were surely brilliant. Oddly enough he too draws for usan unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets. The favoured rival isWilliam Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own that if the poet must be rejected sucha rejection would seem more in harmony with&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;ournotions of what ought not to have been.</p><p>Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk’s egg, prize oftheir fray.</p><p>He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost lovethy man?</p><p>&mdash;That may be too, Stephen said. There’s a saying of Goethe’s which MrMagee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you will getit in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a <i>buonaroba,</i> a baywhere all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a lordling towoo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrelgentleman and he had written <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Why? Belief in himselfhas been untimely killed. He was overborne in a cornfield first (ryefield, Ishould say) and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor playvictoriously the game of laugh and lie down. Assumed dongiovannism will notsave him. No later undoing will undo the first undoing. The tusk of the boarhas wounded him there where love lies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yetthere remains to her woman’s invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words,some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of thefirst, darkening even his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits himand the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.</p><p>They list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.</p><p>&mdash;The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the porchof a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know themanner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with thatknowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast with two backs thaturged it King Hamlet’s ghost could not know of were he not endowed withknowledge by his creator. That is why the speech (his lean unlovely English) isalways turned elsewhere, backward. Ravisher and ravished, what he would butwould not, go with him from Lucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen’sbreast, bare, with its mole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creationhe has piled up to hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But,because loss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminishedpersonality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he hasrevealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by Elsinore’srocks or what you will, the sea’s voice, a voice heard only in the heart of himwho is the substance of his shadow, the son consubstantial with the father.</p><p>&mdash;Amen! was responded from the doorway.</p><p>Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?</p><p><i>Entr’acte</i>.</p><p>A ribald face, sullen as a dean’s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then blithe inmotley, towards the greeting of their smiles.

A most instructive discussion.Mr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare.All sides of life should be represented.</p><p>He smiled on all sides equally.</p><p>Buck Mulligan thought, puzzled:</p><p>&mdash;Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.</p><p>A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.</p><p>&mdash;To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes likeSynge.</p><p>Mr Best turned to him.</p><p>&mdash;Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He’ll see you after at theD. B. C. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s <i>Lovesongs of Connacht</i>.</p><p>&mdash;I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?</p><p>&mdash;The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tiredperhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played Hamletfor the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining held that theprince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an Irishman? Judge Barton, Ibelieve, is searching for some clues. He swears (His Highness not His Lordship)by saint Patrick.</p><p>&mdash;The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said,lifting his brilliant notebook. That <i>Portrait of Mr W. H.</i> where heproves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.</p><p>&mdash;For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.</p><p>Or Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?</p><p>&mdash;I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Ofcourse it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues, the colour,but it’s so typical the way he works it out. It’s the very essence of Wilde,don’t you know. The light touch.</p><p>His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe. Tameessence of Wilde.</p><p>You’re darned witty.

Themocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.</p><p>They talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness.</p><p>Buck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head wagging,he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His mobile lips read,smiling with new delight.</p><p>&mdash;Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!</p><p>He sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:</p><p>&mdash;<i>The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring theimmense debtorship for a thing done.</i> Signed: Dedalus. Where did you launchit from? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four quid? The aunt isgoing to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram! Malachi Mulligan, TheShip, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you priestified Kinchite!</p><p>Joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulousbrogue:</p><p>&mdash;It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were,Haines and myself, the time himself brought it in. ’Twas murmur we did for agallus potion would rouse a friar, I’m thinking, and he limp with leching.

He heardyou pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He’s out in pampooties to murder you.</p><p>&mdash;Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.</p><p>Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling.</p><p>&mdash;Murder you! he laughed.</p><p>Harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights inrue Saint-André-des-Arts.

So Mr Justice Madden in his<i>Diary of Master William Silence</i> has found the hunting terms... Yes? Whatis it?</p><p>&mdash;There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward andoffering a card. From the <i>Freeman.</i> He wants to see the files of the<i>Kilkenny People</i> for last year.</p><p>&mdash;Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...</p><p>He took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked, asked,creaked, asked:</p><p>&mdash;Is he?... O, there!</p><p>Brisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked withvoluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most honestbroadbrim.</p><p>&mdash;This gentleman? <i>Freeman’s Journal?

This way...Please, sir...</p><p>Voluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing darkfigure following his hasty heels.</p><p>The door closed.</p><p>&mdash;The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.</p><p>He jumped up and snatched the card.</p><p>&mdash;What’s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.</p><p>He rattled on:</p><p>&mdash;Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in themuseum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that hasnever been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her. <i>Life oflife, thy lips enkindle.</i></p><p>Suddenly he turned to Stephen:</p><p>&mdash;He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker thanthe Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove. VenusKallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! <i>The god pursuing the maidenhid</i>.</p><p>&mdash;We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best’s approval. Webegin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if at all, asa patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.</p><p>&mdash;Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beautyfrom Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy in whom ascore of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty years he lived inLondon and, during part of that time, he drew a salary equal to that of thelord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His art, more than the art offeudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the art of surfeit. Hot herringpies,green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar of roses, marchpane, gooseberriedpigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter Raleigh, when they arrested him, had half amillion francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays. The gombeenwomanEliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years hedallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatorylove and its foul pleasures. You know Manningham’s story of the burgher’s wifewho bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in <i>Richard III</i>and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing, took the cowby the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate, answered from thecapon’s blankets: <i>William the conqueror came before Richard III</i>. And thegay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and his dainty birdsnies, ladyPenelope Rich, a clean quality woman is suited for a player, and the punks ofthe bankside, a penny a time.</p><p>Cours la Reine. <i>Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites cochonneries.Minette? Tu veux?</i></p><p>&mdash;The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of Oxford’s motherwith her cup of canary for any cockcanary.</p><p>Buck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:</p><p>&mdash;Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!</p><p>&mdash;And Harry of six wives’ daughter. And other lady friends from neighbourseats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those twenty years whatdo you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes?</p><p>Do and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist, hewalks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of Juno’s eyes,violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do. Afar, in a reek oflust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.</p><p>Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton’s desk sharply.</p><p>&mdash;Whom do you suspect? he challenged.</p><p>&mdash;Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twicespurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.</p><p>Love that dare not speak its name.</p><p>&mdash;As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved alord.</p><p>Old wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.</p><p>&mdash;It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for allother and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for thestallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew towife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two deeds are rank inthat ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favourhas declined, deceased husband’s brother. Sweet Ann, I take it, was hot in theblood. Once a wooer, twice a wooer.</p><p>Stephen turned boldly in his chair.</p><p>&mdash;The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If youdeny that in the fifth scene of <i>Hamlet</i> he has branded her with infamytell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between theday she married him and the day she buried him. All those women saw their mendown and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her poor dear Willun, when he wentand died on her, raging that he was the first to go, Joan, her four brothers,Judith, her husband and all her sons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan’sdaughter, Elizabeth, to use granddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killedher first.</p><p>O, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in royalLondon to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her father’sshepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he has commendedher to posterity.</p><p>He faced their silence.</p><p class="letter">To whom thus Eglinton: You mean the will.<br/>But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.<br/>She was entitled to her widow’s dower<br/>At common law.

Why did he not leave her his bestbed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace?</p><p>&mdash;It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, MrSecondbest Best said finely.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Separatio a mensa et a thalamo</i>, bettered Buck Mulligan and wassmiled on.</p><p>&mdash;Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.Let me think.</p><p>&mdash;Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,Stephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays tributeto his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife andbids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don’t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis)and let her live in his villa.</p><p>&mdash;Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean...</p><p>&mdash;He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for aking. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!</p><p>&mdash;What? asked Besteglinton.</p><p>William Shakespeare and company, limited. The people’s William. For termsapply: E. Dowden, Highfield house...</p><p>&mdash;Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought ofthe charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his hands and said:<i>All we can say is that life ran very high in those days.</i> Lovely!</p><p>Catamite.</p><p>&mdash;The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best tougling Eglinton.</p><p>Steadfast John replied severe:</p><p>&mdash;The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cakeand have it.</p><p>Sayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?</p><p>&mdash;And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his ownlong pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself acornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots.His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by ChettleFalstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued a fellowplayer forthe price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest forevery money lent. How else could Aubrey’s ostler and callboy get rich quick?All events brought grist to his mill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting thatfollowed the hanging and quartering of the queen’s leech Lopez, his jew’s heartbeing plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive: <i>Hamlet</i> and<i>Macbeth</i> with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with aturn for witchroasting. The lost armada is his jeer in <i>Love’s LabourLost</i>. His pageants, the histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafekingenthusiasm. Warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter’s theory ofequivocation. The <i>Sea Venture</i> comes home from Bermudas and the playRenan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin. The sugaredsonnets follow Sidney’s. As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise carrotty Bess, thegross virgin who inspired <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, let some meinherrfrom Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of thebuckbasket.</p><p>I think you’re getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture oftheolologicophilolological. <i>Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere.</i></p><p>&mdash;Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly. Your dean ofstudies holds he was a holy Roman.</p><p><i>Sufflaminandus sum.</i></p><p>&mdash;He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French polisherof Italian scandals.</p><p>&mdash;A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him myriadminded.</p><p><i>Amplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitiainter multos.</i></p><p>&mdash;Saint Thomas, Stephen began...</p><p>&mdash;<i>Ora pro nobis</i>, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.</p><p>There he keened a wailing rune.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Pogue mahone! Acushla machree!</i> It’s destroyed we are from thisday! It’s destroyed we are surely!</p><p>All smiled their smiles.</p><p>&mdash;Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoyreading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different fromthat of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his wise andcurious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that the love so given toone near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who, it may be,hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with avarice, are of all races themost given to intermarriage. Accusations are made in anger. The christian lawswhich built up the hoards of the jews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm wasshelter) bound their affections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sinsor virtues old Nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds sotightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will holdtightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife. Nosir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or hismaidservant or his jackass.</p><p>&mdash;Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.</p><p>&mdash;Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.</p><p>&mdash;Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.</p><p>&mdash;The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will’swidow, is the will to die.</p><p><i>&mdash;Requiescat!</i> Stephen prayed.</p><p class="poem">What of all the will to do?<br/>It has vanished long ago...</p><p>&mdash;She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobledqueen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcaris now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes. In old age shetakes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at New Place and drank a quart ofsack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask)and heard she had a soul. She read or had read to her his chapbooks preferringthem to the <i>Merry Wives</i> and, loosing her nightly waters on the jordan,she thought over <i>Hooks and Eyes for Believers’ Breeches</i> and <i>The mostSpiritual Snuffbox to Make the Most Devout Souls Sneeze</i>. Venus has twistedher lips in prayer. Agenbite of inwit: remorse of conscience. It is an age ofexhausted whoredom groping for its god.</p><p>&mdash;History shows that to be true, <i>inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos</i>.The ages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man’sworst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that Russellis right. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say that only familypoets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man. I feel that the fatknight is his supreme creation.</p><p>Lean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping with thegodless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him. Visits himhere on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there’s a gentleman to see you. Me? Sayshe’s your father, sir. Give me my Wordsworth. Enter Magee Mor Matthew, a ruggedrough rugheaded kern, in strossers with a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocksbemired with clauber of ten forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.</p><p>Your own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.</p><p>Hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I touched hishand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is attending her. The eyesthat wish me well. But do not know me.</p><p>&mdash;A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessaryevil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father’s death. If youhold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters, with thirtyfiveyears of life, <i>nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita</i>, with fifty ofexperience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then you must holdthat his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No. The corpse of JohnShakespeare does not walk the night. From hour to hour it rots and rots. Herests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised that mystical estate upon hisson. Boccaccio’s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself withchild. Fatherhood, in the sense of conscious begetting, is unknown to man. Itis a mystical estate, an apostolic succession, from only begetter to onlybegotten. On that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italianintellect flung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and foundedirremovably because founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon thevoid. Upon incertitude, upon unlikelihood. <i>Amor matris</i>, subjective andobjective genitive, may be the only true thing in life. Paternity may be alegal fiction. Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or heany son?</p><p>What the hell are you driving at?</p><p>I know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.</p><p><i>Amplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea.</i></p><p>Are you condemned to do this?</p><p>&mdash;They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminalannals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities, hardlyrecord its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters, lesbic sisters,loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with grandmothers, jailbirds withkeyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son unborn mars beauty: born, he bringspain, divides affection, increases care. He is a new male: his growth is hisfather’s decline, his youth his father’s envy, his friend his father’s enemy.</p><p>In rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.</p><p>&mdash;What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.</p><p>Am I a father? If I were?</p><p>Shrunken uncertain hand.</p><p>&mdash;Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of thefield, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of Aquin, withwhom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if the father who has nota son be not a father can the son who has not a father be a son? WhenRutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in thecomedy of errors wrote <i>Hamlet</i> he was not the father of his own sonmerely but, being no more a son, he was and felt himself the father of all hisrace, the father of his own grandfather, the father of his unborn grandson who,by the same token, never was born, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her,abhors perfection.</p><p>Eglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladly glancing, amerry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.</p><p>Flatter. Rarely. But flatter.</p><p>&mdash;Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big withchild. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! The play’sthe thing! Let me parturiate!</p><p>He clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.</p><p>&mdash;As for his family, Stephen said, his mother’s name lives in the forestof Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in<i>Coriolanus.</i> His boyson’s death is the deathscene of young Arthur in<i>King John.</i> Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who thegirls in <i>The Tempest</i>, in <i>Pericles,</i> in <i>Winter’s Tale</i> are weknow. Who Cleopatra, fleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may guess.But there is another member of his family who is recorded.</p><p>&mdash;The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.</p><p>The quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with haste,quake, quack.</p><p>Door closed.

Like John o’Gaunt his name is dear to him, as dearas the coat and crest he toadied for, on a bend sable a spear or steeledargent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer than his glory of greatestshakescene in the country. What’s in a name? That is what we ask ourselves inchildhood when we write the name that we are told is ours. A star, a daystar, afiredrake, rose at his birth. It shone by day in the heavens alone, brighterthan Venus in the night, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, therecumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars.His eyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as hewalked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from Shottery andfrom her arms.</p><p>Both satisfied.

Father Dineen wants...</p><p>&mdash;O, Father Dineen! Directly.</p><p>Swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.</p><p>John Eglinton touched the foil.</p><p>&mdash;Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.You kept them for the last, didn’t you?</p><p>&mdash;In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie andnuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A brotheris as easily forgotten as an umbrella.</p><p>Lapwing.</p><p>Where is your brother? Apothecaries’ hall. My whetstone. Him, then Cranly,Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They mock to try you.Act. Be acted on.</p><p>Lapwing.</p><p>I am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.</p><p>On.</p><p>&mdash;You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which hetook the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others? Richard,a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann (what’s in aname?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard the conqueror, thirdbrother, came after William the conquered. The other four acts of that playhang limply from that first. Of all his kings Richard is the only kingunshielded by Shakespeare’s reverence, the angel of the world. Why is theunderplot of <i>King Lear</i> in which Edmund figures lifted out of Sidney’s<i>Arcadia</i> and spatchcocked on to a Celtic legend older than history?</p><p>&mdash;That was Will’s way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine aNorse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. <i>Quevoulez-vous?</i> Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makesUlysses quote Aristotle.</p><p>&mdash;Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or theusurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to Shakespeare, whatthe poor are not, always with him. The note of banishment, banishment from theheart, banishment from home, sounds uninterruptedly from <i>The Two Gentlemenof Verona</i> onward till Prospero breaks his staff, buries it certain fathomsin the earth and drowns his book. It doubles itself in the middle of his life,reflects itself in another, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis,catastrophe. It repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when hismarried daughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But itwas the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will andleft in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of my lordsbishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin, committed byanother in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the lines of his lastwritten words, it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones arenot to be laid. Age has not withered it. Beauty and peace have not done itaway. It is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created, in<i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, twice in <i>As you like It</i>, in <i>TheTempest</i>, in <i>Hamlet,</i> in <i>Measure for Measure</i>&mdash;and in allthe other plays which I have not read.</p><p>He laughed to free his mind from his mind’s bondage.</p><p>Judge Eglinton summed up.</p><p>&mdash;The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He isall in all.</p><p>&mdash;He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.All in all. In <i>Cymbeline,</i> in <i>Othello</i> he is bawd and cuckold. Heacts and is acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he kills thereal Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly willingthat the moor in him shall suffer.</p><p>&mdash;Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!</p><p>Dark dome received, reverbed.</p><p>&mdash;And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed. Whenall is said Dumas <i>fils</i> (or is it Dumas <i>père?)</i> is right. After GodShakespeare has created most.</p><p>&mdash;Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after alife of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has alwaysbeen, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of life ended, heplants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The motion is ended.Gravediggers bury Hamlet <i>père</i> and Hamlet <i>fils.</i> A king and aprince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what though murdered andbetrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or Dubliner, sorrow forthe dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced. If you likethe epilogue look long on it: prosperous Prospero, the good man rewarded,Lizzie, grandpa’s lump of love, and nuncle Richie, the bad man taken off bypoetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He foundin the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible.Maeterlinck says: <i>If Socrates leave his house today he will find the sageseated on his doorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps willtend.</i> Every life is many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves,meeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows,brothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright who wrote thefolio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and the sun twodays later), the lord of things as they are whom the most Roman of catholicscall <i>dio boia</i>, hangman god, is doubtless all in all in all of us, ostlerand butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy ofheaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more marriages, glorified man, anandrogynous angel, being a wife unto himself.</p><p><i>&mdash;Eureka!</i> Buck Mulligan cried. <i>Eureka!</i></p><p>Suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton’s desk.</p><p>&mdash;May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.</p><p>He began to scribble on a slip of paper.</p><p>Take some slips from the counter going out.</p><p>&mdash;Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shalllive. The rest shall keep as they are.</p><p>He laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.</p><p>Unwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his variorumedition of <i>The Taming of the Shrew.</i></p><p>&mdash;You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You havebrought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe your owntheory?</p><p>&mdash;No, Stephen said promptly.</p><p>&mdash;Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it adialogue, don’t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.</p><p>John Eclecticon doubly smiled.</p><p>&mdash;Well, in that case, he said, I don’t see why you should expect paymentfor it since you don’t believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is somemystery in <i>Hamlet</i> but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man Pipermet in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes that the secretis hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to visit the present duke,Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays. It will come asa surprise to his grace. But he believes his theory.</p><p>I believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help me tounbelieve? Who helps to believe? <i>Egomen.</i> Who to unbelieve? Other chap.</p><p>&mdash;You are the only contributor to <i>Dana</i> who asks for pieces ofsilver. Then I don’t know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for anarticle on economics.</p><p>Fraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.</p><p>&mdash;For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.</p><p>Buck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then gravelysaid, honeying malice:</p><p>&mdash;I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upperMecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the <i>Summa contraGentiles</i> in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and Rosalie,the coalquay whore.</p><p>He broke away.</p><p>&mdash;Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.</p><p>Come, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts andoffals.</p><p>Stephen rose.</p><p>Life is many days. This will end.</p><p>&mdash;We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. <i>Notre ami</i> Mooresays Malachi Mulligan must be there.</p><p>Buck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.</p><p>&mdash;Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth ofIreland. I’ll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walkstraight?</p><p>Laughing, he...</p><p>Swill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.</p><p>Lubber...</p><p>Stephen followed a lubber...</p><p>One day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After. His lubback: I followed. I gall his kibe.</p><p>Stephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt head,newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of no thought.</p><p>What have I learned?

J. reset his smooth watch in hisinterior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to three. Just nicetime to walk to Artane. What was that boy’s name again? Dignam. Yes. <i>Veredignum et iustum est.</i> Brother Swan was the person to see. Mr Cunningham’sletter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical catholic: useful atmission time.</p><p>A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches,growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters ofcharity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend JohnConmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew,one silver crown.</p><p>Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long, ofsoldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending theirdays in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words: <i>If I had served myGod as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days.</i>He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came thewife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.</p><p>&mdash;Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?</p><p>Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably forthe waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that so?Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Sheehy himself? Stillin London. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather itwas, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughanwould come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful manreally.</p><p>Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. Iooking sowell and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he wouldcertainly call.</p><p>&mdash;Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.</p><p>Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jetbeads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, in going. Hehad cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.</p><p>Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father BernardVaughan’s droll eyes and cockney voice.</p><p>&mdash;Pilate! Wy don’t you old back that owlin mob?</p><p>A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his way.Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish. Of goodfamily too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?</p><p>O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.</p><p>Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square.Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were they good boysat school? O. That was very good now. And what was his name? Jack Sohan. Andhis name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was Brunny Lynam.O, that was a very nice name to have.</p><p>Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointedto the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.</p><p>&mdash;But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.</p><p>The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:</p><p>&mdash;O, sir.</p><p>&mdash;Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.</p><p>Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter tofather provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father Conmeesmiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.</p><p>Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &amp;c, in silk hat, slate frockcoatwith silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary glovesand pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully tookthe curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court.</p><p>Was that not Mrs M’Guinness?</p><p>Mrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the fartherfootpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. How didshe do?</p><p>A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to thinkthat she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he say?... such aqueenly mien.</p><p>Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup freechurch on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will (D.V.) speak. Theincumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words. Butone should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted according to theirlights.</p><p>Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. Itwas a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare.Surely, there ought to be.</p><p>A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All raised untidycaps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brotherboys.</p><p>Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint Joseph’schurch, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee raised hishat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were alsobadtempered.</p><p>Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. Andnow it was an office or something.</p><p>Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by MrWilliam Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee salutedMr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches andample cools of butter. He passed Grogan’s the Tobacconist against whichnewsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In Americathose things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that,unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.</p><p>Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of whichtwo unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.</p><p>Father Conmee passed H. J. O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny Kellehertotted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. A constable onhis beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable. InYoukstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee observed pig’s puddings, whiteand black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.</p><p>Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, atowhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seatedamidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. It was idyllic:and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turfto be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet tomake fires in the houses of poor people.</p><p>On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint FrancisXavier’s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.</p><p>Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saintAgatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.</p><p>At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for hedisliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.</p><p>Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care inthe eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and fivepennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse. Passing the ivychurch he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when onehad carelessly thrown away the ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of thecar seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. FatherConmee liked cheerful decorum.</p><p>It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmeehad finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee supposed. Atiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses. Sheraised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her smallgloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.</p><p>Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that theawkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.</p><p>Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth ofthe awkward old man who had the shaky head.</p><p>At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old womanrose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the bellstrap tostay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: andFather Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and FatherConmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, shewas one of those good souls who had always to be told twice <i>bless you, mychild,</i> that they have been absolved, <i>pray for me.</i> But they had somany worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.</p><p>From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at FatherConmee.</p><p>Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of hissermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission and of thepropagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellowsouls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came likea thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, <i>Le Nombre desÉlus,</i> seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were millions ofhuman souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.)been brought. But they were God’s souls, created by God. It seemed to FatherConmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.</p><p>At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor andsaluted in his turn.</p><p>The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name. Thejoybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediatehereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. Then came the callto arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. Those were old worldishdays, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.</p><p>Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book <i>Old Times in theBarony</i> and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and ofMary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.</p><p>A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary,first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startledwhen an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedereand not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, <i>eiaculatioseminis inter vas naturale mulieris,</i> with her husband’s brother? She wouldhalf confess if she had not all sinned as women did. Only God knew and she andhe, her husband’s brother.</p><p>Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man’srace on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.</p><p>Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and honouredthere. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble facesin a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And the hands of abride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.</p><p>It was a charming day.</p><p>The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseyingto him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small white cloudsgoing slowly down the wind. <i>Moutonner,</i> the French said. A just andhomely word.</p><p>Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds overRathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowesfield. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of theboys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was theirrector: his reign was mild.</p><p>Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An ivorybookmark told him the page.</p><p>Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.</p><p>Father Conmee read in secret <i>Pater</i> and <i>Ave</i> and crossed hisbreast. <i>Deus in adiutorium.</i></p><p>He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to<i>Res</i> in <i>Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: ineternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ.</i></p><p>A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young womanwith wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised his cap abruptly:the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirta clinging twig.</p><p>Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary.<i>Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cormeum.</i></p><p class="asterism">*    *    *</p><p>Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at apine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and,spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. Chewing hisblade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway. There he tiltedhis hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, lookingidly out.</p><p>Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.</p><p>Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted,chewing his blade of hay.</p><p>Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.</p><p>&mdash;That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.</p><p>&mdash;Ay, Corny Kelleher said.</p><p>&mdash;It’s very close, the constable said.</p><p>Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while agenerous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.</p><p>&mdash;What’s the best news? he asked.</p><p>&mdash;I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with batedbreath.</p><p class="asterism">*    *    *</p><p>A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirtingRabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards LarryO’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:</p><p>&mdash;<i>For England</i>...</p><p>He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted andgrowled:</p><p>&mdash;<i>home and beauty.</i></p><p>J.

Where theforeleg of King Billy’s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hasteninghusband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear thetidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted thesecond carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C., agreeably surprised, madehaste to reply. At Ponsonby’s corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and fourtallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y.’S, while outriders prancedpast and carriages. Opposite Pigott’s music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni,professor of dancing &amp;c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by aviceroy and unobserved. By the provost’s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan,stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of <i>Mygirl’s a Yorkshire girl.</i></p><p>Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders’ skyblue frontlets and high action askyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigoserge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to thethree ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between hislips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention ofhis bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed inCollege park. Unseen brazen highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the<i>cortège</i>:</p><p class="poem">But though she’s a factory lass<br/>And wears no fancy clothes.<br/>Baraabum.<br/>Yet I’ve a sort of a<br/>Yorkshire relish for<br/>My little Yorkshire rose.<br/>Baraabum.</p><p>Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H. Shrift,T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson, C. Adderly andW. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn’s hotel Cashel BoyleO’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a fierce eyeglass acrossthe carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons in the window of theAustro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster street by Trinity’s postern aloyal king’s man, Hornblower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horsespranced by Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutesbeing given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black cap withfingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, onhis way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer’s hospital,drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blindstripling opposite Broadbent’s. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brownmacintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy’spath. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, hisblub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddingtonroad corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in whicheleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoresswithout his golden chain. On Northumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellencyacknowledged punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two smallschoolboys at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired by thelate queen when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the princeconsort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano Artifoni’s sturdy trousersswallowed by a closing door.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="chap11"></a>[ 11 ]</h3><p>Bronze by gold heard the hoofirons, steelyringing.</p><p>Imperthnthn thnthnthn.</p><p>Chips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips.</p><p>Horrid!

Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair,stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea,choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:</p><p>&mdash;O greasy eyes!

I think I’ll trouble youfor some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.</p><p>Jingle.</p><p>&mdash;With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.</p><p>With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane’s sheturned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystalkeg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe.Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.</p><p>&mdash;By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must be agreat tonic in the air down there.

I didn’t recognise him for the moment. I hear he iskeeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?</p><p>He had.</p><p>&mdash;I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan.

The real classical, you know. And blind too,poor fellow. Not twenty I’m sure he was.</p><p>&mdash;Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.</p><p>He drank and strayed away.</p><p>&mdash;So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.</p><p>God’s curse on bitch’s bastard.</p><p>Tink to her pity cried a diner’s bell.

Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaidsmoking mid nice waves. Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming:lovelorn. For some man. For Raoul.

In the mild breezes of thewest and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions theirfirstclass foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exaltedplanetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal worldwith which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in closeproximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs whilethey play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden ingots,silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels offingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar towoo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfetteredMunster and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of Cruachan’sland and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district of Boyle, princes,the sons of kings.</p><p>And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen bymariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for thatpurpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that landfor O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain descended fromchieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring foison of the fields,flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans,strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes andtallies of iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of theearth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bereand rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellatedapples and chips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy andpelurious, and strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.</p><p>I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him.

Be acorporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog. I’mtold for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man inSantry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence.</p><p>&mdash;Stand and deliver, says he.</p><p>&mdash;That’s all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.</p><p>&mdash;Pass, friends, says he.</p><p>Then he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:</p><p>&mdash;What’s your opinion of the times?</p><p>Doing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to theoccasion.</p><p>&mdash;I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down hisfork.</p><p>So begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:</p><p>&mdash;Foreign wars is the cause of it.</p><p>And says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:</p><p>&mdash;It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise.</p><p>&mdash;Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I.

Are we going to win?Eh?</p><p>And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and, byJesus, he near throttled him.</p><p>The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of abroadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckledshaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneedbrawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero. From shoulder to shoulderhe measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered, aswas likewise the rest of his body wherever visible, with a strong growth oftawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (<i>UlexEuropeus</i>). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawnyhue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscuritythe fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes in which a tear and asmile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsizedcauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals fromthe profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud stronghale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing theground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the caveto vibrate and tremble.</p><p>He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to theknees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle ofplaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin, roughlystitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased in high Balbrigganbuskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod with brogues of saltedcowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast.

A couched spear ofacuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal ofthe canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasyslumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements whichhis master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mightycudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone.</p><p>So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the sightnearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid.

The long fellowgave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old lunatic is goneround to Green street to look for a G man.</p><p>&mdash;When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up.

Who’s talking about...?</p><p>&mdash;Dead! says Alf. He’s no more dead than you are.</p><p>&mdash;Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morninganyhow.</p><p>&mdash;Paddy? says Alf.</p><p>&mdash;Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.</p><p>&mdash;Good Christ! says Alf.</p><p>Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted.</p><p>In the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by tantrashad been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing luminosity ofruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of the etheric double beingparticularly lifelike owing to the discharge of jivic rays from the crown ofthe head and face. Communication was effected through the pituitary body andalso by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacralregion and solar plexus. Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts inthe heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of pr&#257;l&#257;y&#257;or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirstyentities on the lower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his firstsensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen asin a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilitiesof atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life thereresembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from morefavoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with everymodern home comfort such as t&#257;l&#257;f&#257;n&#257;,&#257;l&#257;v&#257;t&#257;r, h&#257;t&#257;k&#257;ld&#257;,w&#257;t&#257;kl&#257;s&#257;t and that the highest adepts were steeped inwaves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart ofbuttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he had anymessage for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side ofM&#257;y&#257; to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devaniccircles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle wherethe ram has power. It was then queried whether there were any special desireson the part of the defunct and the reply was: <i>We greet you, friends ofearth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K. doesn’t pile it on.</i> It wasascertained that the reference was to Mr Cornelius Kelleher, manager of MessrsH. J. O’Neill’s popular funeral establishment, a personal friend of thedefunct, who had been responsible for the carrying out of the intermentarrangements. Before departing he requested that it should be told to his dearson Patsy that the other boot which he had been looking for was at presentunder the commode in the return room and that the pair should be sent toCullen’s to be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this hadgreatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly requestedthat his desire should be made known.</p><p>Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimatedthat this had given satisfaction.</p><p>He is gone from mortal haunts: O’Dignam, sun of our morning.

Here, says he, take themto hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?</p><p>So they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and hecouldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he’djust take a cigar. Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake.</p><p>&mdash;Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.</p><p>And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a blackborder round it.</p><p>&mdash;They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hangtheir own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.</p><p>And he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels downwhen he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the ropeafter and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.</p><p>In the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their deadlycoil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hathdone a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord.</p><p>So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes outwith the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the olddog smelling him all the time I’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queerodour coming off them for dogs about I don’t know what all deterrent effect andso forth and so on.</p><p>&mdash;There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.</p><p>&mdash;What’s that? says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf.</p><p>&mdash;That so? says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;God’s truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was inKilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when they cuthim down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker.</p><p>&mdash;Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.</p><p>&mdash;That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It’s only a naturalphenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the...</p><p>And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and thisphenomenon and the other phenomenon.</p><p>The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medicalevidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervicalvertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would, according to thebest approved tradition of medical science, be calculated to inevitably producein the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of thegenital apparatus, thereby causing the elastic pores of the <i>corporacavernosa</i> to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitatethe flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or maleorgan resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty amorbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection <i>in articulo mortis perdiminutionem capitis.</i></p><p>So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and hestarts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the menof sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about allthe fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for the cause by drumheadcourtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that and the other. Talking aboutnew Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brutesniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs. And roundhe goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what hecould get. So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:</p><p>&mdash;Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw here!Give us the paw!</p><p>Arrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumblingoff the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds ofdrivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog:give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit outof the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to bring. Gob, he golloped it downlike old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more. Near atethe tin and all, hungry bloody mongrel.</p><p>And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the brothersSheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for yourcountry, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she’s far from the land.And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with hislardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with aback on her like a ballalley. Time they were stopping up in the <i>CityArms</i> pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a crackedloodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing themollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will andnot eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her crawand taking the lout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds ofDublin and, by the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him homeas drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils ofalcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near roast him, it’s a queerstory, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd that kept the hotel. Jesus, Ihad to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat. And Bloom withhis <i>but don’t you see?</i> and <i>but on the other hand</i>. And sure, morebe token, the lout I’m told was in Power’s after, the blender’s, round in Copestreet going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking hisway through all the samples in the bloody establishment. Phenomenon!</p><p>&mdash;The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass andglaring at Bloom.</p><p>&mdash;Ay, ay, says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...</p><p>&mdash;<i>Sinn Fein!</i> says the citizen. <i>Sinn Fein amhain!</i> The friendswe love are by our side and the foes we hate before us.</p><p>The last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far and nearthe funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precinctsrolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollowbooming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzlingflashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that theartillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesomespectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angryheavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at thelowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of DublinMetropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in personmaintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reedband whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on theirblackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from the cradle bySperanza’s plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholsteredcharabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whomthere were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by thefavourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang <i>The Nightbefore Larry was stretched</i> in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our twoinimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers ofthe comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish funwithout vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children ofthe Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking thescene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainmentand a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for theirexcellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children agenuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included manywellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourablepositions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known asthe Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directlyopposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of CommendatoreBacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed <i>doyen</i> of the party who had tobe assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), MonsieurPierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, theArchjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha VirágaKisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y.

All the delegates without exception expressedthemselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning thenameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animatedaltercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O. T. E. I. as towhether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth ofIreland’s patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars,boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults,knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows werefreely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by specialcourier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitudeproposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for bothcontending parties. The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at once appealed toall and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartilycongratulated by all the F. O. T. E. I., several of whom were bleedingprofusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath thepresidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimithat the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstractedby him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hopeof bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundredladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored totheir rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.</p><p>Quietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morningdress and wearing his favourite flower, the <i>Gladiolus Cruentus</i>. Heannounced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many have tried(unsuccessfully) to imitate&mdash;short, painstaking yet withal socharacteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman wasgreeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal ladieswaving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitableforeign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries, <i>hoch, banzai,eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive, Allah</i>, amid which theringing <i>evviva</i> of the delegate of the land of song (a high double Frecalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalanibeglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily distinguishable. It wasexactly seventeen o’clock. The signal for prayer was then promptly given bymegaphone and in an instant all heads were bared, the commendatore’spatriarchal sombrero, which has been in the possession of his family since therevolution of Rienzi, being removed by his medical adviser in attendance, DrPippi. The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religionto the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a mostchristian spirit in a pool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, andoffered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hard by theblock stood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in atengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyesglowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of hishorrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapidsuccession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fellbut necessary office. On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatlyarranged the quartering knife, the various finely tempered disembowellingappliances (specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs JohnRound and Sons, Sheffield), a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of theduodenum, colon, blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extractedand two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of themost precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and dogs’ homewas in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished to that beneficentinstitution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs, friedsteak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious hot breakfast rolls andinvigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for theconsumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spiritswhen prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedingsfrom beginning to end but he, with an abnegation rare in these our times, rosenobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to)that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sickand indigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem. The<i>nec</i> and <i>non plus ultra</i> of emotion were reached when the blushingbride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flungherself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched intoeternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embracemurmuring fondly <i>Sheila, my own</i>. Encouraged by this use of her christianname she kissed passionately all the various suitable areas of his person whichthe decencies of prison garb permitted her ardour to reach. She swore to him asthey mingled the salt streams of their tears that she would ever cherish hismemory, that she would never forget her hero boy who went to his death with asong on his lips as if he were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park.She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhoodtogether on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocentpastimes of the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughedheartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in thegeneral merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight. But anonthey were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time. Afresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourseof people, touched to the inmost core, broke into heartrending sobs, not theleast affected being the aged prebendary himself. Big strong men, officers ofthe peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary, were making frankuse of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eyein that record assemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsomeyoung Oxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, steppedforward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical tree,solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to name the day,and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience was presented with atasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbonesbrooch, a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion: andwhen the gallant young Oxonian (the bearer, by the way, of one of the mosttimehonoured names in Albion’s history) placed on the finger of his blushing<i>fiancée</i> an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of afourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the sternprovostmarshal, lieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, whopresided on the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoysfrom the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his naturalemotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and wasoverheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate<i>entourage,</i> to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:</p><p>&mdash;God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey itmakes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause Ithinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way.</p><p>So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporationmeeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak their own languageand Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting inhis old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking aboutthe Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland.Antitreating is about the size of it. Gob, he’d let you pour all manner ofdrink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see thefroth of his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of theirmusical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of hay shecould my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly blue ribbon badgespiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen bawns going about withtemperance beverages and selling medals and oranges and lemonade and a few olddry buns, gob, flahoolagh entertainment, don’t be talking. Ireland sober isIreland free. And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and allthe gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one ortwo sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with thefemales, hitting below the belt.</p><p>So howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty startsmousing around by Joe and me. I’d train him by kindness, so I would, if he wasmy dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn’t blind him.</p><p>&mdash;Afraid he’ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.</p><p>&mdash;No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.</p><p>So he calls the old dog over.</p><p>&mdash;What’s on you, Garry? says he.</p><p>Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the oldtowser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera. Such growlingyou never heard as they let off between them. Someone that has nothing betterto do ought to write a letter <i>pro bono publico</i> to the papers about themuzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling and grousing and his eyeall bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of hisjaws.</p><p>All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the loweranimals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not missing thereally marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish redsetter wolfdog formerly known by the <i>sobriquet</i> of Garryowen and recentlyrechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry. Theexhibition, which is the result of years of training by kindness and acarefully thoughtout dietary system, comprises, among other achievements, therecitation of verse. Our greatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall notdrag it from us!) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate andcompare the verse recited and has found it bears a <i>striking</i> resemblance(the italics are ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are notspeaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer whoconceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branchhas familiarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O. C.points out in an interesting communication published by an eveningcontemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in thesatirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to saynothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye. Wesubjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholarwhose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believethat our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication.The metrical system of the canine original, which recalls the intricatealliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely morecomplicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been wellcaught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased ifOwen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive ofsuppressed rancour.</p><p class="poem">The curse of my curses<br/>Seven days every day<br/>And seven dry Thursdays<br/>On you, Barney Kiernan,<br/>Has no sup of water<br/>To cool my courage,<br/>And my guts red roaring<br/>After Lowry’s lights.</p><p>So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could hear himlapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have another.</p><p>&mdash;I will, says he, <i>a chara</i>, to show there’s no ill feeling.</p><p>Gob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one pub toanother, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog and getting fedup by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for man and beast. And saysJoe:</p><p>&mdash;Could you make a hole in another pint?</p><p>&mdash;Could a swim duck? says I.</p><p>&mdash;Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won’t have anything in theway of liquid refreshment? says he.</p><p>&mdash;Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meetMartin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam’s. Martinasked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn’t serve anynotice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the actthe mortgagee can’t recover on the policy.</p><p>&mdash;Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock islanded. So the wife comes out top dog, what?</p><p>&mdash;Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers.</p><p>&mdash;Whose admirers? says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.</p><p>Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act likethe lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wifeand that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgemanthe money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee’s right tillhe near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act. He wasbloody safe he wasn’t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue andvagabond only he had a friend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do youcall it royal Hungarian privileged lottery. True as you’re there. O, commend meto an israelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.</p><p>So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorryfor her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that hesaid and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer, a finer thanpoor little Willy that’s dead to tell her. Choking with bloody foolery. Andshaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic to tell her that. Shake hands, brother.You’re a rogue and I’m another.</p><p>&mdash;Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, howeverslight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded, as Ihope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you thisfavour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerityof my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.</p><p>&mdash;No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives whichactuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to meconsoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow, this proofof your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup.</p><p>&mdash;Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart, Ifeel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressionswhich are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy, were I to givevent to my feelings, would deprive me even of speech.</p><p>And off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five o’clock. Nighthe was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby, 14A. Blind to theworld up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time, fornicating with twoshawls and a bully on guard, drinking porter out of teacups. And callinghimself a Frenchy for the shawls, Joseph Manuo, and talking against theCatholic religion, and he serving mass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young withhis eyes shut, who wrote the new testament, and the old testament, and huggingand smugging. And the two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets,the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawlsscreeching laughing at one another. <i>How is your testament? Have you got anold testament?</i> Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then see himof a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging her tail upthe aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no less, and her violets,nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney’s sister. And the oldprostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples. Gob, Jack made himtoe the line. Told him if he didn’t patch up the pot, Jesus, he’d kick theshite out of him.</p><p>So Terry brought the three pints.</p><p>&mdash;Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Slan leat</i>, says he.</p><p>&mdash;Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.</p><p>Gob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small fortuneto keep him in drinks.</p><p>&mdash;Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;Friend of yours, says Alf.</p><p>&mdash;Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?</p><p>&mdash;I won’t mention any names, says Alf.</p><p>&mdash;I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with WilliamField, M. P., the cattle traders.</p><p>&mdash;Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of allcountries and the idol of his own.</p><p>So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and thecattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them allto the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and ahoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue.Because he was up one time in a knacker’s yard.

Because the poor animals suffer andexperts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t cause pain to the animal andon the sore spot administer gently.

Klook Klook Klook.</p><p>&mdash;Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London toask about it on the floor of the house of commons.</p><p>&mdash;Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him,as it happens.</p><p>&mdash;Well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.</p><p>&mdash;That’s too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr Fieldis going. I couldn’t phone. No. You’re sure?</p><p>&mdash;Nannan’s going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a questiontomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the park.What do you think of that, citizen? <i>The Sluagh na h-Eireann</i>.</p><p>Mr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of myhonourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right honourablegentleman whether the government has issued orders that these animals shall beslaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming as to their pathologicalcondition?</p><p>Mr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in possession ofthe evidence produced before a committee of the whole house. I feel I cannotusefully add anything to that. The answer to the honourable member’s questionis in the affirmative.</p><p>Mr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued for theslaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the Phoenix park?</p><p>Mr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.</p><p>Mr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman’s famous Mitchelstowntelegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench? (O! O!)</p><p>Mr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.</p><p>Mr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don’t hesitate to shoot.</p><p>(Ironical opposition cheers.)</p><p>The speaker: Order! Order!</p><p>(The house rises. Cheers.)</p><p>&mdash;There’s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There heis sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion of allIreland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best throw, citizen?</p><p>&mdash;<i>Na bacleis</i>, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There wasa time I was as good as the next fellow anyhow.</p><p>&mdash;Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.</p><p>&mdash;Is that really a fact? says Alf.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, says Bloom. That’s well known. Did you not know that?</p><p>So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of lawntennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and buildingup a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom had to have his saytoo about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent exercise was bad. I declareto my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you saidto Bloom: <i>Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That’s a straw</i>. Declareto my aunt he’d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.</p><p>A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of <i>BrianO’Ciarnain’s</i> in <i>Sraid na Bretaine Bheag</i>, under the auspices of<i>Sluagh na h-Eireann</i>, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and theimportance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancientRome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerablepresident of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of largedimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman, a magnificentoration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most interesting and instructivediscussion of the usual high standard of excellence ensued as to thedesirability of the revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancientPanceltic forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the causeof our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for theresuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning andevening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manlystrength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who metwith a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the negative thevocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in response to repeatedrequests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkablynoteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses(happily too familiar to need recalling here) <i>A nation once again</i> in theexecution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said without fear ofcontradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi wasin superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatestadvantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it. Hissuperb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly enhanced hisalready international reputation, was vociferously applauded by the largeaudience among which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy aswell as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learnedprofessions. The proceedings then terminated.</p><p>Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L. L. D.;the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S. Sp.; the rev.T.

Blazes? says Joe.</p><p>And says Bloom:</p><p>&mdash;What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training theeye.</p><p>&mdash;Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run upthe odds and he swatting all the time.</p><p>&mdash;We know him, says the citizen. The traitor’s son. We know what putEnglish gold in his pocket.</p><p>&mdash;True for you, says Joe.</p><p>And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood,asking Alf:</p><p>&mdash;Now, don’t you think, Bergan?</p><p>&mdash;Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only abloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See thelittle kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God, he gave himone last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made him puke what henever ate.</p><p>It was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled to donthe gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he was by lack ofpoundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft.The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both champions. Thewelterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixupduring which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts, theartilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet’s nose, and Myler came onlooking groggy. The soldier got to business, leading off with a powerful leftjab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flushto the point of Bennett’s jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted himwith a left hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips.Myler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with thebulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose right eyewas nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally drenched with waterand when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck, confident ofknocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was a fight to a finish and thebest man for it. The two fought like tigers and excitement ran fever high. Thereferee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky andhis footwork a treat to watch. After a brisk exchange of courtesies duringwhich a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from hisopponent’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed aterrific left to Battling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him flat. It was aknockout clean and clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser wasbeing counted out when Bennett’s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the toweland the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public whobroke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight.</p><p>&mdash;He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he’s runninga concert tour now up in the north.</p><p>&mdash;He is, says Joe. Isn’t he?</p><p>&mdash;Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That’s quite true. Yes, a kind of summer tour,you see. Just a holiday.</p><p>&mdash;Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn’t she? says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;My wife? says Bloom. She’s singing, yes. I think it will be a successtoo.

God, I’d give anything to hearhim before a judge and jury.</p><p>&mdash;Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and nothingbut the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.</p><p>&mdash;Me? says Alf. Don’t cast your nasturtiums on my character.</p><p>&mdash;Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidenceagainst you.</p><p>&mdash;Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not<i>compos mentis</i>. U. p: up.</p><p><i>&mdash;Compos</i> your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he’s balmy?Look at his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on witha shoehorn.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictmentfor publishing it in the eyes of the law.</p><p>&mdash;Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.</p><p>&mdash;Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half andhalf.</p><p>&mdash;How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...</p><p>&mdash;Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that’s neither fish norflesh.</p><p>&mdash;Nor good red herring, says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;That what’s I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what thatis.</p><p>Begob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on accountof it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stutteringfool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen outon grass with his beard out tripping him, bringing down the rain. And she withher nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow’swas pewopener to the pope. Picture of him on the wall with his SmashallSweeney’s moustaches, the signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papalZouave to the Holy Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And whowas he, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings aweek, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to theworld.</p><p>&mdash;And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to besufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my opinionan action might lie.</p><p>Six and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our pints inpeace. Gob, we won’t be let even do that much itself.</p><p>&mdash;Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.</p><p>&mdash;Good health, Ned, says J. J.</p><p>&mdash;-There he is again, says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;Where? says Alf.</p><p>And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and thewife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they wentpast, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a secondhand coffin.</p><p>&mdash;How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;Remanded, says J. J.</p><p>One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought aliasSaphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers saying he’d give apassage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see any green in the white of myeye? Course it was a bloody barney. What? Swindled them all, skivvies andbadhachs from the county Meath, ay, and his own kidney too. J. J. was tellingus there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessboxwith his hat on him, swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.</p><p>&mdash;Who tried the case? says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;Recorder, says Ned.</p><p>&mdash;Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.</p><p>&mdash;Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrearsof rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve in tearson the bench.</p><p>&mdash;Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dockthe other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for thecorporation there near Butt bridge.</p><p>And he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:</p><p>&mdash;A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?Ten, did you say?</p><p>&mdash;Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.</p><p>&mdash;And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the courtimmediately, sir. No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment. How dare you, sir,come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking industriousman! I dismiss the case.</p><p>And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in thethird week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, the daughterof the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first quarter, it came to passthat those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law. There masterCourtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave his rede and master JusticeAndrews, sitting without a jury in the probate court, weighed well and ponderedthe claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the willpropounded and final testamentary disposition <i>in re</i> the real andpersonal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versusLivingstone, an infant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn courtof Green street there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him thereabout the hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the brehons at thecommission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county ofthe city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelvetribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of Patrick and of thetribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the tribe of Conn and of thetribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and of the tribe of Finn and of thetribe of Dermot and of the tribe of Cormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of thetribe of Caolte and of the tribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good menand true. And he conjured them by Him who died on rood that they should welland truly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between theirsovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict giveaccording to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And they rose intheir seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by the name of Him Who is fromeverlasting that they would do His rightwiseness. And straightway the minionsof the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds ofjustice had apprehended in consequence of information received. And theyshackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise butpreferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor.</p><p>&mdash;Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Irelandfilling the country with bugs.</p><p>So Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe, telling himhe needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first but if he would justsay a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by thathe’d do the devil and all.</p><p>&mdash;Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must haverepetition. That’s the whole secret.</p><p>&mdash;Rely on me, says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. Wewant no more strangers in our house.</p><p>&mdash;O, I’m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It’s just thatKeyes, you see.</p><p>&mdash;Consider that done, says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;Very kind of you, says Bloom.</p><p>&mdash;The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in. Webrought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbershere.</p><p>&mdash;Decree <i>nisi,</i> says J. J.</p><p>And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a spider’s webin the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling after him and the olddog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when.</p><p>&mdash;A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all ourmisfortunes.</p><p>&mdash;And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the <i>PoliceGazette</i> with Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.</p><p>&mdash;Give us a squint at her, says I.</p><p>And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off ofCorny Kelleher.

Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off ofthat one, what?</p><p>So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him aslong as a late breakfast.</p><p>&mdash;Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action? Whatdid those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about theIrish language?</p><p>O’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the puissant andhigh and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which hadbefallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient city, second of therealm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after due prayers to the godswho dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn counsel whereby they might, if sobe it might be, bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speechof the seadivided Gael.</p><p>&mdash;It’s on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutalSassenachs and their <i>patois.</i></p><p>So J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till you heardanother and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your blind eye to thetelescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation, and Bloomtrying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and theircivilisation.</p><p>&mdash;Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! Thecurse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged sons ofwhores’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of the name. Anycivilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons of bastards’ ghosts.</p><p>&mdash;The European family, says J. J....</p><p>&mdash;They’re not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Eganof Paris. You wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in Europeexcept in a <i>cabinet d’aisance.</i></p><p>And says John Wyse:</p><p>&mdash;Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.</p><p>And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:</p><p>&mdash;<i>Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!</i></p><p>He said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the medherof dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan <i>Lamh Dearg Abu</i>,he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty valorous heroes, rulersof the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster silent as the deathless gods.</p><p>&mdash;What’s up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that hadlost a bob and found a tanner.</p><p>&mdash;Gold cup, says he.</p><p>&mdash;Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.</p><p><i>&mdash;Throwaway,</i> says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And therest nowhere.</p><p>&mdash;And Bass’s mare? says Terry.</p><p>&mdash;Still running, says he. We’re all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid onmy tip <i>Sceptre</i> for himself and a lady friend.</p><p>&mdash;I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on <i>Zinfandel</i> that Mr Flynngave me. Lord Howard de Walden’s.</p><p>&mdash;Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse.<i>Throwaway,</i> says he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions.Frailty, thy name is <i>Sceptre.</i></p><p>So he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was anythinghe could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his luck with his mangysnout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.</p><p>&mdash;Not there, my child, says he.</p><p>&mdash;Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She’d have won the money only for theother dog.</p><p>And J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom sticking inan odd word.</p><p>&mdash;Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others’ eyes but they can’tsee the beam in their own.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Raimeis</i>, says the citizen. There’s no-one as blind as the fellowthat won’t see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twentymillions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes? Andour potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our wool thatwas sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our damask from thelooms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and our white flint glassdown there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin that we have since Jacquard deLyon and our woven silk and our Foxford tweeds and ivory raised point from theCarmelite convent in New Ross, nothing like it in the whole wide world. Whereare the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules, theGibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple tosell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even GiraldusCambrensis. Wine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second tonone, our farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip ofSpain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our waters. Whatdo the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade and our ruinedhearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they won’t deepen with millionsof acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption?</p><p>&mdash;As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligolandwith its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land. Larches,firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was reading areport of lord Castletown’s...</p><p>&mdash;Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftainelm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the trees ofIreland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of Eire, O.</p><p>&mdash;Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.</p><p>The fashionable international world attended <i>en masse</i> this afternoon atthe wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief ranger ofthe Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine Valley.

The bride who was given away by herfather, the M’Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in a creationcarried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip of gloaming grey,sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with a triple flounce ofdarkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by bretelles and hip insertions ofacorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss Larch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer,sisters of the bride, wore very becoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty<i>motif</i> of plume rose being worked into the pleats in a pinstripe andrepeated capriciously in the jadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers ofpaletinted coral. Senhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknownability and, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, playeda new and striking arrangement of <i>Woodman, spare that tree</i> at theconclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre <i>inHorto</i> after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a playfulcrossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow, ivytod,hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs Wyse ConiferNeaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.</p><p>&mdash;And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade withSpain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were pupped,Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.</p><p>&mdash;And will again, says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says thecitizen, clapping his thigh. Our harbours that are empty will be full again,Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom of Kerry,Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with a fleet of masts ofthe Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the O’Kennedys of Dublin whenthe earl of Desmond could make a treaty with the emperor Charles the Fifthhimself. And will again, says he, when the first Irish battleship is seenbreasting the waves with our own flag to the fore, none of your Henry Tudor’sharps, no, the oldest flag afloat, the flag of the province of Desmond andThomond, three crowns on a blue field, the three sons of Milesius.</p><p>And he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like atanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody life isworth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude inShanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking forhim to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant.</p><p>&mdash;Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?</p><p>&mdash;An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.</p><p>&mdash;Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?</p><p>&mdash;Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.</p><p>Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead ofattending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to cracktheir bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head down like abull at a gate. And another one: <i>Black Beast Burned in Omaha, Ga</i>. A lotof Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a Sambo strung up in a treewith his tongue out and a bonfire under him. Gob, they ought to drown him inthe sea after and electrocute and crucify him to make sure of their job.</p><p>&mdash;But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?</p><p>&mdash;I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is.Read the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on thetraining ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself <i>DisgustedOne</i>.</p><p>So he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew of tarsand officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the parson with hisprotestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad brought out, howling forhis ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of a gun.</p><p>&mdash;A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir JohnBeresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on thebreech.</p><p>And says John Wyse:</p><p>&mdash;’Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.</p><p>Then he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane and hedraws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad till he yellsmeila murder.</p><p>&mdash;That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses theearth. The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary chamberon the face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a dozen gamehogs andcottonball barons. That’s the great empire they boast about of drudges andwhipped serfs.</p><p>&mdash;On which the sun never rises, says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. Theunfortunate yahoos believe it.</p><p>They believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth, and inJacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast, born of thefighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified, flayed andcurried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose again from the bed,steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till further orders whence he shallcome to drudge for a living and be paid.</p><p>&mdash;But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn’tit be the same here if you put force against force?</p><p>Didn’t I tell you? As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his lastgasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.</p><p>&mdash;We’ll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greaterIreland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the black 47.Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid low by thebatteringram and the <i>Times</i> rubbed its hands and told the whiteliveredSaxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as redskins in America. Eventhe Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the Sassenach tried to starve thenation at home while the land was full of crops that the British hyenas boughtand sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay, they drove out the peasants in hordes. Twentythousand of them died in the coffinships. But those that came to the land ofthe free remember the land of bondage. And they will come again and with avengeance, no cravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen niHoulihan.</p><p>&mdash;Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...</p><p>&mdash;We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since thepoor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala.</p><p>&mdash;Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged usagainst the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the brokentreatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the wild geese.Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan in Spain, and UlyssesBrowne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria Teresa. But what did we ever getfor it?</p><p>&mdash;The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know whatit is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren’t they trying tomake an <i>Entente cordiale</i> now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with perfidiousAlbion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Conspuez les Français</i>, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.</p><p>&mdash;And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we hadenough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the electordown to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s dead?</p><p>Jesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one withthe winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God, oldVic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body andbones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him oldbits of songs about <i>Ehren on the Rhine</i> and come where the boose ischeaper.</p><p>&mdash;Well, says J.

Edward Guelph-Wettin!</p><p>&mdash;And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests andbishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty’sracing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode.

A nation is the same people living in the sameplace.</p><p>&mdash;By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’mliving in the same place for the past five years.</p><p>So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck out ofit:</p><p>&mdash;Or also living in different places.</p><p>&mdash;That covers my case, says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.</p><p>&mdash;Ireland, says Bloom.

Take that in your right hand and repeatafter me the following words.</p><p>The muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish faceclothattributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors of theBook of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth prolongedadmiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the cornerpieces, theacme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each of the four evangelists inturn presenting to each of the four masters his evangelical symbol, a bogoaksceptre, a North American puma (a far nobler king of beasts than the Britisharticle, be it said in passing), a Kerry calf and a golden eagle fromCarrantuohill. The scenes depicted on the emunctory field, showing our ancientduns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning andmaledictive stones, are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicateas when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy longlong ago in the time of the Barmecides.

Which is which?</p><p>&mdash;That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.</p><p>&mdash;And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.Also now. This very moment. This very instant.</p><p>Gob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.</p><p>&mdash;Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs tous by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auctionin Morocco like slaves or cattle.</p><p>&mdash;Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.</p><p>&mdash;I’m talking about injustice, says Bloom.</p><p>&mdash;Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.</p><p>That’s an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old lardyfacestanding up to the business end of a gun.

Did you read that skit in the <i>UnitedIrishman</i> today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting England?</p><p>&mdash;What’s that? says Joe.</p><p>So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts readingout:</p><p>&mdash;A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presentedyesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting, LordWalkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks ofBritish traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions. Thedelegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate,in the course of a happy speech, freely translated by the British chaplain, thereverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones, tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkupand emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the Britishempire, stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions anilluminated bible, the volume of the word of God and the secret of England’sgreatness, graciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the greatsquaw Victoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the RoyalDonor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast<i>Black and White</i> from the skull of his immediate predecessor in thedynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the chieffactory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book, subsequentlyexecuting a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course of which heswallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause from the girlhands.</p><p>&mdash;Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn’t doubt her. Wonder did he put thatbible to the same use as I would.</p><p>&mdash;Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful landthe broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.</p><p>&mdash;Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.</p><p>&mdash;No, says the citizen. It’s not signed Shanganagh. It’s only initialled:P.</p><p>&mdash;And a very good initial too, says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;That’s how it’s worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.</p><p>&mdash;Well, says J. J., if they’re any worse than those Belgians in the CongoFree State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what’s this hisname is?</p><p>&mdash;Casement, says the citizen. He’s an Irishman.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, that’s the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and floggingthe natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them.</p><p>&mdash;I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.</p><p>&mdash;Who? says I.</p><p>&mdash;Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on<i>Throwaway</i> and he’s gone to gather in the shekels.</p><p>&mdash;Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a horsein anger in his life?</p><p>&mdash;That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to backthat horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip. Bet youwhat you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He’s the only man inDublin has it. A dark horse.</p><p>&mdash;He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.</p><p>&mdash;There you are, says Terry.</p><p>Goodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort. So I just went round the back of the yard topumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was letting off my<i>(Throwaway</i> twenty to) letting off my load gob says I to myself I knew hewas uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in Slattery’s off) in his mindto get off the mark to (hundred shillings is five quid) and when they were inthe (dark horse) pisser Burke was telling me card party and letting on thechild was sick (gob, must have done about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wifespeaking down the tube <i>she’s better</i> or <i>she’s</i> (ow!) all a plan sohe could vamoose with the pool if he won or (Jesus, full up I was) tradingwithout a licence (ow!) Ireland my nation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be upto those bloody (there’s the last of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.</p><p>So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it wasBloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds ofjerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government andappointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries.Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that puts the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppyeyes is mucking up the show. Give us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from thelikes of that bloody mouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his oldfellow before him perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbingbagman, that poisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping thecountry with his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms.Any amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No security.Gob, he’s like Lanty MacHale’s goat that’d go a piece of the road with everyone.</p><p>&mdash;Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse. And there’s the man now that’ll tellyou all about it, Martin Cunningham.</p><p>Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with himand a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of the collectorgeneral’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawinghis pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king’s expense.</p><p>Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys.</p><p>&mdash;Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.Saucy knave! To us!</p><p>So saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.</p><p>Mine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.</p><p>&mdash;Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.</p><p>&mdash;Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds.And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.</p><p>&mdash;Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a barelarder. I know not what to offer your lordships.</p><p>&mdash;How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasantcountenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun?</p><p>An instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage.</p><p>&mdash;Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king’smessengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The king’sfriends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my house I warrantme.</p><p>&mdash;Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trenchermanby his aspect. Hast aught to give us?</p><p>Mine host bowed again as he made answer:</p><p>&mdash;What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops ofvenison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s head withpistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon of oldRhenish?</p><p>&mdash;Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!</p><p>&mdash;Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a barelarder, quotha! ’Tis a merry rogue.</p><p>So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.</p><p>&mdash;Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.</p><p>&mdash;Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen aboutBloom and the Sinn Fein?</p><p>&mdash;That’s so, says Martin. Or so they allege.</p><p>&mdash;Who made those allegations? says Alf.</p><p>&mdash;I, says Joe. I’m the alligator.</p><p>&mdash;And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like thenext fellow?</p><p>&mdash;Why not? says J. J., when he’s quite sure which country it is.</p><p>&mdash;Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hellis he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.</p><p>&mdash;Who is Junius? says J. J.</p><p>&mdash;We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.</p><p>&mdash;He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was hedrew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that in thecastle.</p><p>&mdash;Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.</p><p>&mdash;Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, thefather’s name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the father did.</p><p>&mdash;That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saintsand sages!</p><p>&mdash;Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For thatmatter so are we.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, says J. J., and every male that’s born they think it may be theirMessiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till heknows if he’s a father or a mother.</p><p>&mdash;Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.</p><p>&mdash;O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of histhat died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a tin ofNeave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.</p><p>&mdash;<i>En ventre sa mère</i>, says J. J.</p><p>&mdash;Do you call that a man? says the citizen.</p><p>&mdash;I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.</p><p>&mdash;Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.</p><p>&mdash;And who does he suspect? says the citizen.</p><p>Gob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed middlings heis. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a month with headache likea totty with her courses. Do you know what I’m telling you? It’d be an act ofGod to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloodysea. Justifiable homicide, so it would. Then sloping off with his five quidwithout putting up a pint of stuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not asmuch as would blind your eye.</p><p>&mdash;Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can’t wait.</p><p>&mdash;A wolf in sheep’s clothing, says the citizen. That’s what he is. Viragfrom Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.</p><p>&mdash;Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.</p><p>&mdash;Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.</p><p>&mdash;You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.</p><p>&mdash;Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,says the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores.</p><p>&mdash;Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is myprayer.</p><p>&mdash;Amen, says the citizen.</p><p>&mdash;And I’m sure He will, says Joe.</p><p>And at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with acolytes,thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and subdeacons, the blessedcompany drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors and guardians and monks andfriars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto, Carthusians and Camaldolesi,Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians and Vallombrosans, and the friars ofAugustine, Brigittines, Premonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and thechildren of Peter Nolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children ofElijah prophet led by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other:and friars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers,minimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of Dominic, thefriars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks of S.

And last, beneath a canopy of cloth of gold came thereverend Father O’Flynn attended by Malachi and Patrick. And when the goodfathers had reached the appointed place, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co,limited, 8, 9 and 10 little Britain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandyshippers, licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption onthe premises, the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windowsand the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and thepediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and thecupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed thatGod might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac andJacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein. And entering heblessed the viands and the beverages and the company of all the blessedanswered his prayers.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.</i></p><p>&mdash;<i>Qui fecit cœlum et terram.</i></p><p>&mdash;<i>Dominus vobiscum.</i></p><p>&mdash;<i>Et cum spiritu tuo.</i></p><p>And he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed andthey all with him prayed:</p><p>&mdash;<i>Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effundesuper creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et voluntatemTuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem sanctissimi nominis Tuicorporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominumnostrum.</i></p><p>&mdash;And so say all of us, says Jack.</p><p>&mdash;Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.</p><p>&mdash;Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson.

Come along now.</p><p>&mdash;Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It’s asecret.</p><p>And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.</p><p>&mdash;Bye bye all, says Martin.</p><p>And he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or whateveryou call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all at sea and upwith them on the bloody jaunting car.</p><p>&mdash;Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.</p><p>The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop thehelmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with allsail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew nigh tostarboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of the noble bark, theylinked their shining forms as doth the cunning wheelwright when he fashionsabout the heart of his wheel the equidistant rays whereof each one is sister toanother and he binds them all with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feetof men whenas they ride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair.Even so did they come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters.And they laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave thewaves.</p><p>But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizengetting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the dropsy, and hecursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and candle in Irish, spittingand spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechauntrying to peacify him.</p><p>&mdash;Let me alone, says he.</p><p>And begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls out ofhim:</p><p>&mdash;Three cheers for Israel!</p><p>Arrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake anddon’t be making a public exhibition of yourself.

Your fly is open, mister!</p><p>And says he:</p><p>&mdash;Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And theSaviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.</p><p>&mdash;He had no father, says Martin. That’ll do now. Drive ahead.</p><p>&mdash;Whose God? says the citizen.</p><p>&mdash;Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a jewlike me.</p><p>Gob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.</p><p>&mdash;By Jesus, says he, I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holyname.By Jesus, I’ll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.</p><p>&mdash;Stop! Stop! says Joe.</p><p>A large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from themetropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid farewell toNagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander Thom’s, printers to HisMajesty, on the occasion of his departure for the distant clime ofSzázharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás (Meadow of Murmuring Waters). The ceremonywhich went off with great <i>éclat</i> was characterised by the most affectingcordiality. An illuminated scroll of ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irishartists, was presented to the distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of alarge section of the community and was accompanied by the gift of a silvercasket, tastefully executed in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a workwhich reflects every credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob <i>agus</i> Jacob. Thedeparting guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who werepresent being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck upthe wellknown strains of <i>Come Back to Erin</i>, followed immediately by<i>Rakóczsy’s March</i>. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along thecoastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three RockMountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the Galtees, the Oxand Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the Bograghs, the Connemarahills, the reeks of M’Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty, Slieve Bernagh and SlieveBloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin, responded to by answering cheers froma big muster of henchmen on the distant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, themastodontic pleasureship slowly moved away saluted by a final floral tributefrom the representatives of the fair sex who were present in large numberswhile, as it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, theflags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as were alsothose of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and the Poolbeg Light.<i>Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra!</i> Gone but notforgotten.</p><p>Gob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow andout with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like astuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s royal theatre:</p><p>&mdash;Where is he till I murder him?</p><p>And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.</p><p>&mdash;Bloody wars, says I, I’ll be in for the last gospel.</p><p>But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other way andoff with him.</p><p>&mdash;Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!</p><p>Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the sun wasin his eyes or he’d have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it into thecounty Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the carlike bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinboxclattering along the street.</p><p>The catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The observatoryof Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth grade ofMercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar seismicdisturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year of therebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been that part of themetropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay ward and parish of Saint Michancovering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods and one square pole or perch.All the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice weredemolished and that noble edifice itself, in which at the time of thecatastrophe important legal debates were in progress, is literally a mass ofruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buriedalive. From the reports of eyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waveswere accompanied by a violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character.An article of headgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerkof the crown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handlewith the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of the eruditeand worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder ofDublin, have been discovered by search parties in remote parts of the islandrespectively, the former on the third basaltic ridge of the giant’s causeway,the latter embedded to the extent of one foot three inches in the sandy beachof Holeopen bay near the old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose thatthey observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling throughthe atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest bywest. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from allparts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciouslypleased to decree that a special <i>missa pro defunctis</i> shall be celebratedsimultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all theepiscopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See insuffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedlycalled away from our midst. The work of salvage, removal of <i>débris,</i>human remains etc has been entrusted to Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 GreatBrunswick street, and Messrs T. and C.

Gob, if he got that lotteryticket on the side of his poll he’d remember the gold cup, he would so, butbegob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe foraiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure asGod made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did.

And they beheld Him in the chariot,clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment as of the sun, fairas the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him. And therecame a voice out of heaven, calling: <i>Elijah! Elijah!</i> And He answeredwith a main cry: <i>Abba!

Faraway in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting daylingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howthguarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymountshore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forthat times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pureradiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.</p><p>The three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene andthe air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and oft were they wontto come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparklingwaves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with thebaby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys,dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name <i>H. M. S.Belleisle</i> printed on both. For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarcefour years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all thatdarling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them.They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castlesas children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day waslong. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcarwhile that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but elevenmonths and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginningto lisp his first babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease hisfat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.</p><p>&mdash;Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink ofwater.</p><p>And baby prattled after her:</p><p>&mdash;A jink a jink a jawbo.</p><p>Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, sopatient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take hiscastor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him thescatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on. What a persuasivepower that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, aperfect little dote in his new fancy bib. None of your spoilt beauties, FloraMacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath oflife, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on hercherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughedtoo at the quaint language of little brother.</p><p>But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and MasterJacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this goldenrule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky hadbuilt and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to bearchitecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had. But ifMaster Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to themaxim that every little Irishman’s house is his castle, he fell upon his hatedrival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas torelate!) the coveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfitedMaster Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.</p><p>&mdash;Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch youfor that.</p><p>His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their bigsister’s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was too after hismisadventure. His little man-o’-war top and unmentionables were full of sandbut Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life’s tiny troublesand very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit.Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so shekissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit andsaid if she was near him she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing inadmonition.</p><p>&mdash;Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.</p><p>She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:</p><p>&mdash;What’s your name? Butter and cream?</p><p>&mdash;Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy yoursweetheart?</p><p>&mdash;Nao, tearful Tommy said.</p><p>&mdash;Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.</p><p>&mdash;Nao, Tommy said.</p><p>&mdash;I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from hershortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart. Gerty is Tommy’ssweetheart.</p><p>&mdash;Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.</p><p>Cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to EdyBoardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn’t seeand to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.</p><p>But who was Gerty?</p><p>Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing faraway into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irishgirlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced beautiful by all who knewher though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Herfigure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those ironjelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much betterthan the Widow Welch’s female pills and she was much better of those dischargesshe used to get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almostspiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuineCupid’s bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster withtapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could makethem though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take amilk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, adeliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girlchums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest ofmortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her thattold her or she’d never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due.There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly <i>hauteur</i> about Gertywhich was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep.Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her ownright and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowellmight easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seenherself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at herfeet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her. Mayhap it was this,the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles alook, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendencyto the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist. Why have women such eyes ofwitchery? Gerty’s were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes anddark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive.It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of thePrincess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gavethat haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, andshe had never regretted it. Then there was blushing scientifically cured andhow to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but yournose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But Gerty’scrowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown with anatural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moonand it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters andpared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy’s words as atelltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks shelooked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God’s fair landof Ireland did not hold her equal.</p><p>For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was about toretort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination prompted herto speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips pouted awhile butthen she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in itall the freshness of a young May morning. She knew right well, no-one better,what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when itwas simply a lovers’ quarrel. As per usual somebody’s nose was out of jointabout the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding upand down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in theevenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on andhe was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left thehigh school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races inTrinity college university. Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, thatdull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was youngand perchance he might learn to love her in time. They were protestants in hisfamily and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virginand then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite noseand he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too atthe back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off thecommon and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off thebars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they wereboth of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was sofrightfully clever because he didn’t go and ride up and down in front of herbit of a garden.</p><p>Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of DameFashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out. A neatblouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected inthe <i>Lady’s Pictorial</i> that electric blue would be worn) with a smart veeopening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept apiece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchiefspoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off herslim graceful figure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hatof wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggbluechenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday weekafternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what shewanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you wouldnever notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by herself andwhat joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflectionwhich the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keepthe shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew.Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself thatshe was very <i>petite</i> but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, afive, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smartbuckle over her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfectproportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of hershapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide gartertops. As for undies they were Gerty’s chief care and who that knows thefluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never seeseventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four dinky setswith awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each setslotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve andpeagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home fromthe wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because shewouldn’t trust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things.She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour andlucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the greenshe wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to studyfor the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be outbecause when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pairon her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put thosethings on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you solong as it wasn’t of a Friday.</p><p>And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there allthe time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in theprivacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could havea good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knewhow to cry nicely before the mirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The palylight of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowellyearns in vain. Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of amarriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.C. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and inthe fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuousconfection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be. He was tooyoung to understand. He would not believe in love, a woman’s birthright. Thenight of the party long ago in Stoer’s (he was still in short trousers) whenthey were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the verylips. He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a halfkiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened fromthe room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength ofcharacter had never been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would woo andwin Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always waiting to beasked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No prince charming isher beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manlyman with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hairslightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in hissheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionatenature and comfort her with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For sucha one she yearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs tobe his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health,till death us two part, from this to this day forward.</p><p>And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was justthinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife tobe. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, BerthaSupple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo inNovember. She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty waswomanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess. Hergriddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann’s pudding of delightfulcreaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand alsofor lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir inthe same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white ofeggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people thatmade her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poeticallike violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroomwith pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovelydog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for thechairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer jumble sales like they havein rich houses. He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admiredtall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmedsweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon(three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug andcosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple butperfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to businesshe would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a momentdeep down into her eyes.</p><p>Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then shebuttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and playwith Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy said he wanted theball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took itthere’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted hisball and he pranced on the ground, if you please. The temper of him! O, he wasa man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy toldhim no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give into him.</p><p>&mdash;You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It’s my ball.</p><p>But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger andshe snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it infull career, having won the day.</p><p>&mdash;Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.</p><p>And she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here’s thelord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread carriage and here hewalks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. But Edy got as cross astwo sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always pettinghim.</p><p>&mdash;I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t say.</p><p>&mdash;On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.</p><p>Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying anunladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her life to say,flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentlemanopposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Ciss.</p><p>&mdash;Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of hernose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at him.</p><p>Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes. Forinstance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberryram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with redink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she saidshe wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White. That was just likeCissycums. O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in herfather’s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonvilleroad, smoking a cigarette. There was none to come up to her for fun. But shewas sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made,not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.</p><p>And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthemof the organ. It was the men’s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner,the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the MostBlessed Sacrament. They were there gathered together without distinction ofsocial class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fanebeside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before thefeet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseechingher to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin ofvirgins. How sad to poor Gerty’s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutchesof the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit curedin Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none.Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in abrown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazingout of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket,thinking. But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homeshad cast its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in thehome circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her ownfather, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for ifthere was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who liftshis hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as thelowest of the low.</p><p>And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virginmost merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companionsor the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green thatCissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strandtaking a short walk. You never saw him any way screwed but still and for allthat she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something oron account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbunclynose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose.Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang <i>Tell me,Mary, how to woo thee</i> or <i>My love and cottage near Rochelle</i> and theyhad stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper andwhen he sang <i>The moon hath raised</i> with Mr Dignam that died suddenly andwas buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her mother’s birthday thatwas and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs andPatsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken. No-one wouldhave thought the end was so near. Now he was laid to rest. And her mother saidto him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn’teven go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town tobring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby’s cork lino,artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and alwaysbright and cheery in the home.</p><p>A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, aministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold. And whenher mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the mentholcone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t like her mother’s takingpinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about,taking snuff. Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways. It wasGerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty whotacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight thechlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture ofhalcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then witha threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove witholdtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a storybehind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in a soft clingingwhite in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked athorough aristocrat. She often looked at them dreamily when she went there fora certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like herswith the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found outin Walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about thehalcyon days what they meant.</p><p>The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at lastMaster Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind thatdeliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedyrocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckilythe gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to therescue and intercepted the ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything withlusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throwit to her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw itup the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stoppedright under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock. The twins clamouredagain for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it soGerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn’t come rollingdown to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.</p><p>&mdash;If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.</p><p>Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her prettycheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt alittle but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kickand it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle.Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of thegentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm flush, a danger signal alwayswith Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they hadonly exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hatshe ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in thetwilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.</p><p>Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and withit the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin,spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel ofsingular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And careworn hearts were thereand toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, theireyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverendfather Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in hisfamous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it wasnot recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection wereever abandoned by her.</p><p>The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhoodare but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardmantill he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep she cried behind thehood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped upher head and cried ah! and, my word, didn’t the little chap enjoy that! Andthen she told him to say papa.</p><p>&mdash;Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.</p><p>And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for elevenmonths everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfectlittle bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great,they said.</p><p>&mdash;Haja ja ja haja.</p><p>Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit upproperly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holysaint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the otherway under him. Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at suchtoilet formalities and he let everyone know it:</p><p>&mdash;Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.</p><p>And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all no usesoothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee andwhere was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth theteat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.</p><p>Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of thatand not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins.She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the paintings that man usedto do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leavingthem there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and theBailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of thoseincense they burned in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed herheart went pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning inhis look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through andthrough, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, butcould you trust them? People were so queer. She could see at once by his darkeyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of thephoto she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache whichshe preferred because she wasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wantedthey two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not seewhether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly <i>retroussé</i> from where hewas sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of ahaunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given worlds to knowwhat it was. He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick theball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if sheswung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. She was glad thatsomething told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wyliemight be out but that was far away. Here was that of which she had so oftendreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because shewanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else. Thevery heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knewon the instant it was him. If he had suffered, more sinned against thansinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, shecared not. Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert himeasily if he truly loved her. There were wounds that wanted healing withheartbalm. She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine hehad known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearnedto know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, makehim forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently,like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownestgirlie, for herself alone.</p><p>Refuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. <i>Ora pro nobis</i>. Well hasit been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never belost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflictedbecause of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. Gerty couldpicture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up,the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodalityand Father Conroy was helping Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things inand out with his eyes cast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionboxwas so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and ifever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come tothe convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when shetold him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair forfear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of natureand we were all subject to nature’s laws, he said, in this life and that thatwas no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, hesaid, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be itdone unto me according to Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and oftenshe thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floraldesign for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on themantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house totell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhapsan album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.</p><p>The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threwthe ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little monkeys commonas ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding forthemselves to keep them in their places, the both of them. And Cissy and Edyshouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come inon them and be drowned.</p><p>&mdash;Jacky! Tommy!</p><p>Not they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last timeshe’d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and she ran down theslope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour ifthere had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbinginto it she couldn’t get it to grow long because it wasn’t natural so she couldjust go and throw her hat at it. She ran with long gandery strides it was awonder she didn’t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on herbecause there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forwardpiece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and justbecause she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all theend of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. Itwould have served her just right if she had tripped up over somethingaccidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make herlook tall and got a fine tumble. <i>Tableau!</i> That would have been a verycharming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.</p><p>Queen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, theyprayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed thethurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the BlessedSacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to givethem a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t because she thought he mightbe watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gertycould see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then CanonO’Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up atthe Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the <i>Tantum ergo</i> andshe just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the<i>Tantumer gosa cramen tum</i>. Three and eleven she paid for those stockingsin Sparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter andthere wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent,and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek ofher!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.</p><p>Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hatanyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging thetwo kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like arag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature. Gertyjust took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, adaintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl’s shoulders&mdash;aradiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You wouldhave to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like ofthat. She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyesthat set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could seefrom underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breathcaught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a snakeeyes its prey. Her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised the devil inhim and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till thelovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.</p><p>Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, halfsmiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby.Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one couldget on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And she saidto Gerty:</p><p>&mdash;A penny for your thoughts.</p><p>&mdash;What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. Iwas only wondering was it late.</p><p>Because she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and theirbabby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentlehint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time andMiss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time tokiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.</p><p>&mdash;Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the timeby his conundrum.</p><p>So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand outof his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain,looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see thathe had enormous control over himself. One moment he had been there, fascinatedby a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quietgravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of hisdistinguishedlooking figure.</p><p>Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the righttime and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and lookingup and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stoppedbut he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set. His voice had acultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was asuspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. Cissy said thanks and came back withher tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.</p><p>Then they sang the second verse of the <i>Tantum ergo</i> and Canon O’Hanlongot up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told FatherConroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers andFather Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentlemanwinding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in andout in time. It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all thetime that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then heput it back and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a kind of asensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and thatirritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the lasttime too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyesfixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literallyworshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man’spassionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face. It is foryou, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.</p><p>Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticedthat that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a longway along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar andCissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractiveof course and Canon O’Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck andFather Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out <i>Panem de coelopraestitisti eis</i> and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the timeand asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she justanswered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken abouther best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shonefrom her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt&mdash;O yes, itcut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knewwould wound like the confounded little cat she was. Gerty’s lips parted swiftlyto frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim,so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamedof. She had loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and ficklelike all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for aninstant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes wereprobing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathyas she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.</p><p>&mdash;O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud headflashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.</p><p>Her words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove,but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young voice that toldthat she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As for Mr Reggy with hisswank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so muchfilth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him andtear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces. And if ever after he dared topresume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make himshrivel up on the spot. Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slightextent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she wassimply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because thatshaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she wassomething aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and neverwould be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they couldput that in their pipe and smoke it.</p><p>Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in theball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandmanwas on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told him too that billywinks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky,laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of funin his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up hiscompliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.</p><p>&mdash;O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.</p><p>The slight <i>contretemps</i> claimed her attention but in two twos she setthat little matter to rights.</p><p>Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy askedwhat and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but shewas ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummatetact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rangout from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up onthe altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving thebenediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.</p><p>How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin,the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forthfrom the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry.And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque shewould have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to makea man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterianchurch grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walkedand lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn hisfreewheel like she read in that book <i>The Lamplighter</i> by Miss Cummins,author of <i>Mabel Vaughan</i> and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams thatno-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake fromBertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to writeher thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though itdid not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. It wasthere she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her childof Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetboxand the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and therewere some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought inHely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she couldonly express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she hadcopied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. <i>Artthou real, my ideal?</i> it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and afterthere was something about <i>twilight, wilt thou ever?</i> and ofttimes thebeauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes withsilent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one,and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and thatwas an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it. Butit must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be noholding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would make the greatsacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his thoughts. Dearer than thewhole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness. There was theallimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or awidower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with theforeign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruelonly to be kind. But even if&mdash;what then? Would it make a very greatdifference? From everything in the least indelicate her finebred natureinstinctively recoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women offthe accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarsemen with no respect for a girl’s honour, degrading the sex and being taken upto the police station. No, no: not that. They would be just good friends like abig brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions ofSociety with a big ess. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for fromthe days beyond recall. She thought she understood. She would try to understandhim because men were so different. The old love was waiting, waiting withlittle white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! Shewould follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he washer all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the masterguide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled,free.</p><p>Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle andgenuflected and the choir sang <i>Laudate Dominum omnes gentes</i> and then helocked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroyhanded him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn’t she coming but JackyCaffrey called out:</p><p>&mdash;O, look, Cissy!</p><p>And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the treesbeside the church, blue and then green and purple.</p><p>&mdash;It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.</p><p>And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holdingTommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.</p><p>&mdash;Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It’s the bazaar fireworks.</p><p>But Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and call. Ifthey could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from whereshe was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling. Shelooked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her.Whitehot passion was in that face, passion silent as the grave, and it had madeher his. At last they were left alone without the others to pry and passremarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterlingman, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face wereworking and a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where thefireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall backlooking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed allher graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicatelyrounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing,because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, becauseBertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she’d never aboutthe gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested DistrictsBoard that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickersand she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imaginesometimes in the bed. But this was altogether different from a thing like thatbecause there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw herface to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. Besides therewas absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being marriedand there ought to be women priests that would understand without your tellingout and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in hereyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors’photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the wayit did.</p><p>And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back andthe garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all sawit and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever sofar to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a softthing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman candle going up over thetrees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitementas it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look upafter it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with adivine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her otherthings too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better thanthose other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being whiteand she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out ofsight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far backthat he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even onthe swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in thatimmodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrousrevealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest beforegentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried tohim chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lipslaid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl’s love, a little strangled cry,wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. And then a rocketsprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it waslike a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of ita stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greenydewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!</p><p>Then all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She glanced athim as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest,of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl. He was leaning backagainst the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowedhead before those young guileless eyes. What a brute he had been! At it again?A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had heanswered? An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinitestore of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he haderred and sinned and wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no.That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there wasnone to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through theevening to and fro and little bats don’t tell.</p><p>Cissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what agreat person she was: and then she cried:</p><p>&mdash;Gerty! Gerty! We’re going. Come on. We can see from farther up.</p><p>Gerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses. She slipped a hand into herkerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course withoutletting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he’s too far to. She rose. Wasit goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she woulddream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve. She drew herselfup to her full height. Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyesthat reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweetflowerlike face. She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smilethat verged on tears, and then they parted.</p><p>Slowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edyto Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was darker now andthere were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed. She walkedwith a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and veryslowly because&mdash;because Gerty MacDowell was...</p><p>Tight boots? No. She’s lame! O!</p><p>Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That’s why she’s left onthe shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was wrong by the cutof her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse in a woman. But makesthem polite. Glad I didn’t know it when she was on show. Hot little devil allthe same. I wouldn’t mind. Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl withglasses. That squinty one is delicate. Near her monthlies, I expect, makes themfeel ticklish. I have such a bad headache today. Where did I put the letter?Yes, all right. All kinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl inTranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad inthe end I suppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha, she.Something in the air. That’s the moon. But then why don’t all women menstruateat the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends on the time they were bornI suppose. Or all start scratch then get out of step. Sometimes Molly and Millytogether. Anyhow I got the best of that. Damned glad I didn’t do it in the baththis morning over her silly I will punish you letter. Made up for thattramdriver this morning. That gouger M’Coy stopping me to say nothing. And hiswife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for smallmercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it themselves.Their natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.Reserve better. Don’t want it they throw it at you. Catch em alive, O. Pitythey can’t see themselves. A dream of wellfilled hose. Where was that? Ah, yes.Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping Tom. Willy’s hat andwhat the girls did with it. Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake?<i>Lingerie</i> does it. Felt for the curves inside her <i>déshabillé.</i>Excites them also when they’re. I’m all clean come and dirty me. And they likedressing one another for the sacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly’s newblouse. At first. Put them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why I bought herthe violet garters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turneduptrousers. He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met. His lovelyshirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman loses a charm withevery pin she takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy lost the pin of her. Dressedup to the nines for somebody. Fashion part of their charm. Just changes whenyou’re on the track of the secret. Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then.No reasonable offer refused. She wasn’t in a hurry either. Always off to afellow when they are. They never forget an appointment. Out on spec probably.They believe in chance because like themselves. And the others inclined to giveher an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms round each other’s necks or withten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the conventgarden. Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up anddown, vindictive too for what they can’t get. Barbed wire. Be sure now andwrite to me. And I’ll write to you. Now won’t you? Molly and Josie Powell. TillMr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon. <i>Tableau!</i> O, lookwho it is for the love of God! How are you at all? What have you been doingwith yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking holes in eachother’s appearance. You’re looking splendid. Sister souls. Showing their teethat one another. How many have you left? Wouldn’t lend each other a pinch ofsalt.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>Devils they are when that’s coming on them. Dark devilish appearance. Mollyoften told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my foot. O thatway! O, that’s exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest once in a way.Wonder if it’s bad to go with them then. Safe in one way. Turns milk, makesfiddlestrings snap. Something about withering plants I read in a garden.Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she’s a flirt. All are.Daresay she felt I. When you feel like that you often meet what you feel. Likedme or what? Dress they look at. Always know a fellow courting: collars andcuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same and stags. Same time might prefer a tieundone or something. Trousers? Suppose I when I was? No. Gently does it.Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss in the dark and never tell. Saw something in me.Wonder what. Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgreaseplastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid gentleman in literary.Ought to attend to my appearance my age. Didn’t let her see me in profile.Still, you never know. Pretty girls and ugly men marrying. Beauty and thebeast. Besides I can’t be so if Molly. Took off her hat to show her hair. Widebrim. Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down orcarry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair strong in rut. Ten bob I got forMolly’s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street. Why not? Supposehe gave her money. Why not? All a prejudice. She’s worth ten, fifteen, more, apound. What? I think so. All that for nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion. Did Iforget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? Andthe day I went to Drimmie’s without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put meoff. No, I remember. Richie Goulding: he’s another. Weighs on his mind. Funnymy watch stopped at half past four. Dust. Shark liver oil they use to clean.Could do it myself. Save. Was that just when he, she?</p><p>O, he did. Into her. She did. Done.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>Mr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that littlelimping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not pleasant. Stillyou have to get rid of it someway. They don’t care. Complimented perhaps. Gohome to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies. Well,aren’t they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have the stage setting, therouge, costume, position, music. The name too. <i>Amours</i> of actresses. NellGwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silvereffulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come andkiss me. Still, I feel. The strength it gives a man. That’s the secret of it.Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam’s. Cider thatwas. Otherwise I couldn’t have. Makes you want to sing after. <i>Lacaus esanttaratara</i>. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you don’tknow how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask you another.Good idea if you’re stuck. Gain time. But then you’re in a cart. Wonderful ofcourse if you say: good evening, and you see she’s on for it: good evening. Obut the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinkingshe was. Whew! Girl in Meath street that night. All the dirty things I made hersay. All wrong of course. My arks she called it. It’s so hard to find one who.Aho! If you don’t answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till theyharden. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings. Parrots.Press the button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn’t called me sir. O,her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That’s whatthey enjoy. Taking a man from another woman. Or even hear of it. Different withme. Glad to get away from other chap’s wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap inthe Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in mypocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don’tthink. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How theychange the venue when it’s not what they like. Ask you do you like mushroomsbecause she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what someone was going to saywhen he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I wantto, something like that. Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up.Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them.She must have been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must sinceshe came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. Thepropitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by theireye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till their dying day.Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside thegardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were developed. Fell asleep then.After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home. Featherbed mountain.Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon.Apoplectic.</p><p>There she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up like arocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be, waiting forsomething to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in mother’s clothes. Timeenough, understand all the ways of the world. And the dark one with the mophead and the nigger mouth. I knew she could whistle. Mouth made for that. LikeMolly. Why that highclass whore in Jammet’s wore her veil only to her nose.Would you mind, please, telling me the right time? I’ll tell you the right timeup a dark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fatlips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of coursethey understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.</p><p>Didn’t look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn’t give thatsatisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine eyesshe had, clear. It’s the white of the eye brings that out not so much thepupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond a dog’s jump.Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture ofVenus with all his belongings on show. Call that innocence? Poor idiot! Hiswife has her work cut out for her. Never see them sit on a bench marked <i>WetPaint</i>. Eyes all over them. Look under the bed for what’s not there. Longingto get the fright of their lives. Sharp as needles they are. When I said toMolly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she mightlike, twigged at once he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that?Typist going up Roger Greene’s stairs two at a time to show her understandings.Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the bone. Millyfor example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing. Bestplace for an ad to catch a woman’s eye on a mirror. And when I sent her forMolly’s Paisley shawl to Prescott’s by the way that ad I must, carrying homethe change in her stocking! Clever little minx. I never told her. Neat way shecarries parcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand,shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you learn thatfrom? Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don’t they know! Three yearsold she was in front of Molly’s dressingtable, just before we left Lombardstreet west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of the world.Young student. Straight on her pins anyway not like the other. Still she wasgame. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf. Transparent stockings,stretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today. A. E. Rumpledstockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.</p><p>A monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads and zrads,zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after withthe pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks. Will she? Watch!Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion. Darling, I saw, your. I saw all.</p><p>Lord!</p><p>Did me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan’s, Dignam’s. For this reliefmuch thanks. In <i>Hamlet,</i> that is. Lord! It was all things combined.Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue. Yourhead it simply swirls. He’s right. Might have made a worse fool of myselfhowever. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I will tell you all. Still itwas a kind of language between us. It couldn’t be? No, Gerty they called her.Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin’s barn ablind.</p><p class="poem">Her maiden name was Jemina Brown<br/>And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.</p><p>Place made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush. Wipingpens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood.Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw anything straight atschool. Crooked as a ram’s horn. Sad however because it lasts only a few yearstill they settle down to potwalloping and papa’s pants will soon fit Willy andfuller’s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job.Saves them. Keeps them out of harm’s way. Nature. Washing child, washingcorpse. Dignam. Children’s hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys,not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds.Oughtn’t to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up with wind.Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan therestill. She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace.That young doctor O’Hare I noticed her brushing his coat. And Mrs Breen and MrsDignam once like that too, marriageable. Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan toldme in the City Arms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like apolecat. Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask inthe morning: was I drunk last night? Bad policy however to fault the husband.Chickens come home to roost. They stick by one another like glue. Maybe thewomen’s fault also. That’s where Molly can knock spots off them. It’s the bloodof the south. Moorish. Also the form, the figure. Hands felt for the opulent.Just compare for instance those others. Wife locked up at home, skeleton in thecupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of anondescript, wouldn’t know what to call her. Always see a fellow’s weak pointin his wife. Still there’s destiny in it, falling in love. Have their ownsecrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn’t takethem in hand. Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, withlittle hubbies. As God made them he matched them. Sometimes children turn outwell enough. Twice nought makes one. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushingbride. Marry in May and repent in December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck.Well the foreskin is not back. Better detach.</p><p>Ow!</p><p>Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and the shortof it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch. Wristwatches arealways going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the personbecause that was about the time he. Yes, I suppose, at once. Cat’s away, themice will play. I remember looking in Pill lane. Also that now is magnetism.Back of everything magnetism. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled.That causes movement. And time, well that’s the time the movement takes. Thenif one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit.

Mysteriousthing too. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself,slow but sure. Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across.Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell themleagues off. Tell you what it is. It’s like a fine fine veil or web they haveall over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they’re alwaysspinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowingit. Clings to everything she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe.Stays. Drawers: little kick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the catlikes to sniff in her shift on the bed.

They floated, fell: they faded. The shepherd’s hour: the hour offolding: hour of tryst. From house to house, giving his everwelcome doubleknock, went the nine o’clock postman, the glowworm’s lamp at his belt gleaminghere and there through the laurel hedges. And among the five young trees ahoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy’s terrace. By screens of lightedwindows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: <i>EveningTelegraph, stop press edition!

Coastguards too. Rocket and breeches buoy andlifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the Erin’s King, throwingthem the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo. Filthy trip. Drunkards out toshake up their livers. Puking overboard to feed the herrings. Nausea. And thewomen, fear of God in their faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarfloose, laughing. Don’t know what death is at that age. And then their stomachsclean. But being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. Ididn’t want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with maskstoo. Throwing them up in the air to catch them. I’ll murder you. Is it onlyhalf fun? Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can people aim guns ateach other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire andnettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that. After getting better asleep withMolly. Very same teeth she has. What do they love?

Nearer the heart? Padding themselves out if fatis in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me. Frightened shewas when her nature came on her first. Poor child! Strange moment for themother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from Buena Vista.O’Hara’s tower. The seabirds screaming. Old Barbary ape that gobbled all hisfamily. Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Looking out over thesea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds.

And there came against theplace as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon. And the travellerLeopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each withother in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause thetraveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breastby a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for whichhe did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice.And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with themthat were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhitherfor he was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady was of his avis andrepreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had saidthing that was false for his subtility. But the learningknight would not hearsay nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list andhe said how it was a marvellous castle. And the traveller Leopold went into thecastle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marchesenvironing in divers lands and sometime venery.</p><p>And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and itwas upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more forenchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are madein a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then inthe horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously. And there werevessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by awarlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles. And fullfair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller nericher. And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in thewhich lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that thisbe possible thing without they see it natheless they are so. And these fisheslie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatnessthat therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. And also it was a marvelto see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecundwheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they doin to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. And they teach theserpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and ofthe scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead.</p><p>And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp theretothe while all they that were there drank every each. And childe Leopold did uphis beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he neverdrank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voidedthe more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile.And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile. Thankedbe Almighty God.</p><p>This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at thereverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there wasabove one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied fast. Sir Leopoldheard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whetherof child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it be not come or now. Meseems itdureth overlong. And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on thatside the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they bothwere knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder hespoke to him full gently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forthby God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellouslong. And the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be hernext. Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never noneasking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully delectably,and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for he was a passinggood man of his lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest thatever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest thatever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of theworld one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly inthe cup. Woman’s woe with wonder pondering.</p><p>Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunkenan they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side the board, thatis to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable’s with other his fellowsLynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the franklin that hight Lenehan andone from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and young Stephen that had mien of a frerethat was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello alllong of a mastery of him erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved youngStephen, he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead) and besidethe meek sir Leopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised tohave come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and tothis his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there afterlongest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in thehonourablest manner. Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth toleave.</p><p>For they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each gen otheras touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that put suchcase it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a matter of someyear agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house that now was trespassed outof this world and the self night next before her death all leeches andpothecaries had taken counsel of her case). And they said farther she shouldlive because in the beginning, they said, the woman should bring forth in painand wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden hadsaid truth for he had conscience to let her die. And not few and of these wasyoung Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it wasnever other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor hisjudges did provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was scant said but allcried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife should live and thebabe to die. In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argumentand what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when topour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack. Then young Maddenshowed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holyreligion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to SaintUltan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby theywere all wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words following:Murmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and parent now glorify theirMaker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire. But, gramercy, what ofthose Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise, which is the sinagainst the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord and Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said,our lust is brief. We are means to those small creatures within us and naturehas other ends than we. Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he whatends. But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him wasthat he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman ifit so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. WhereatCrotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that beast the unicornhow once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all this while,pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him, witnessing alland several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner ofthing that lay in man to do. Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only youngStephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strangehumour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that barewhoso she might be or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of motherChurch that would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith,patron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or bypotency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the influence ofthe occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which herman has but lain with, <i>effectu secuto</i>, or peradventure in her bathaccording to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides. He said also how atthe end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holymother foldeth ever souls for God’s greater glory whereas that earthly motherwhich was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he thatholdeth the fisherman’s seal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holychurch for all ages founded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold wouldhe in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A wariness ofmind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he saiddissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever lovedthe art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his experience ofso seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blowhad birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions.That is truth, pardy, said Dixon, and, or I err, a pregnant word. Which hearingyoung Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealethfrom the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he wasdrunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.</p><p>But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity ofthe terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he wasminded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on hiseleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny.And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial didhim on a fair corselet of lamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he mightperish utterly and lie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter)and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked uponhim his friend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness andas sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for allaccounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure for youngStephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goodswith whores.</p><p>About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so asthere remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approachfrom him that still plied it very busily who, praying for the intentions of thesovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also ashe said is vicar of Bray. Now drink we, quod he, of this mazer and quaff yethis mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul’s bodiment. Leaveye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone. Be not afeard neitherfor any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay. See yehere. And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notesthe worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song whichhe writ. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money aswas herebefore. His words were then these as followeth: Know all men, he said,time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions. What means this? Desire’s wind blaststhe thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon therood of time. Mark me now. In woman’s womb word is made flesh but in the spiritof the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away.This is the postcreation. <i>Omnis caro ad te veniet</i>. No question but hername is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer andHerd, our mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptlythat She hath an <i>omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem</i>, that is to wit, analmightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won us, saithAugustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are linked up with bysuccessive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all, seed, breed and generation,for a penny pippin. But here is the matter now. Or she knew him, that second Isay, and was but creature of her creature, <i>vergine madre, figlia di tuofiglio</i>, or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial orignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and withJoseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages,<i>parceque M. Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l’avait mise dans cette fichueposition c’était le sacré pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder</i>transubstantiality <i>oder</i> consubstantiality but in no casesubsubstantiality. And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word. Apregnancy without joy, he said, a birth without pangs, a body without blemish,a belly without bigness. Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship. With willwill we withstand, withsay.</p><p>Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing abawdy catch <i>Staboo Stabella</i> about a wench that was put in pod of a jollyswashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack: <i>The first threemonths she was not well, Staboo,</i> when here nurse Quigley from the doorangerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she rememberedthem being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came forbecause she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour ofher guard. It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christianwalking, in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did herhortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them allembraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked himwith menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrainseize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou got inpeasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel, thoudykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out of that like acurse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flowerof quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the time’s occasion as most sacredand most worthy to be most sacred. In Horne’s house rest should reign.</p><p>To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles,goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cidedto take friar’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb, chastity in thetomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master Lenehan at this made returnthat he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how, as he heard hereof counted,he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption ofminors and they all intershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to hisfathership. But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their supposefor he was the eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the moreand they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing anddeflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be inguise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nardand tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem <i>Ut novetursexus omnis corporis mysterium</i> till she was there unmaided. He gave themthen a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcherand Master Francis Beaumont that is in their <i>Maid’s Tragedy</i> that waswrit for a like twining of lovers: <i>To bed, to bed</i> was the burden of itto be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals. An exquisite dulcetepithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom theodoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedalproscenium of connubial communion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon,joyed, but, harkee, young sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecherfor, by my troth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen said indeedto his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of thestews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in thosedays and the custom of the country approved with it. Greater love than this, hesaid, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend. Go thou and dolikewise. Thus, or words to that effect, saith Zarathustra, sometime regiusprofessor of French letters to the university of Oxtail nor breathed there everthat man to whom mankind was more beholden. Bring a stranger within thy towerit will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed. <i>Orate, fratres, promemetipso</i>. And all the people shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thygenerations and thy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my wordand broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight andto wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou sinned against my lightand hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of servants. Return, return, ClanMilly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why hast thou done this abomination before methat thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to theRoman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lieluxuriously? Look forth now, my people, upon the land of behest, even fromHoreb and from Nebo and from Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a landflowing with milk and money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: mymoon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left me alone forever in the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thoukissed my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say, hathnot been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned forthe Orient from on high which brake hell’s gates visited a darkness that wasforaneous. Assuefaction minorates atrocities (as Tully saith of his darlingStoics) and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of combustion. Theadiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt’s plague which in the nights ofprenativity and postmortemity is their most proper <i>ubi</i> and<i>quomodo</i>. And as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some meanand measure with their inceptions and originals, that same multiplicitconcordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by aretrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final whichis agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being. The aged sistersdraw us into life: we wail, batten, sport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die:over us dead they bend. First, saved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes,a bed of fasciated wattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occultedsepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage. And as no manknows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby beushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hiddenwhen we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of ourwhoness hath fetched his whenceness.</p><p>Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly <i>Etienne chanson</i> but he loudlybid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majesticlongstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie order,a penny for him who finds the pea.</p><p class="poem">Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack<br/>See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,<br/>In the proud cirque of Jackjohn’s bivouac.</p><p>A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on leftThor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the storm that histhis heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as thegod self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And he that had erstchallenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shranktogether and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a suddenquite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as hetasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some mock and some jeer and PunchCostello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would doafter and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour. But thebraggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhatindifferent and he would not lag behind his lead. But this was only to dye hisdesperation as cowed he crouched in Horne’s hall. He drank indeed at onedraught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly overall the heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked himon his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the braggart’s side,spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear, advertising how it was noother thing but a hubbub noise that he heard, the discharge of fluid from thethunderhead, look you, having taken place, and all of the order of a naturalphenomenon.</p><p>But was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words? No, for he had inhis bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away. Andwas he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other? He was neitheras much as he would have liked to be either. But could he not have endeavouredto have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he livedwithal? Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle. Heard he then inthat clap the voice of the god Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub ofPhenomenon? Heard? Why, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up thetube Understanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw thathe was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as hewas like the rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to die like therest and pass away? By no means would he though he must nor would he make moreshows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to doby the book Law. Then wotted he nought of that other land which is calledBelieve-on-Me, that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightfuland shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving normothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had toldhim of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was thatin the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whosename, she said, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from thetrue path by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turnaside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him soflatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush or, bysome learned, Carnal Concupiscence.</p><p>This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothersthe most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird-in-the-Hand (whichwas within all foul plagues, monsters and a wicked devil) they would strain thelast but they would make at her and know her. For regarding Believe-on-Me theysaid it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of itfor, first, Two-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grotand in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printedon them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and, second,for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them forPreservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and, third, that theymight take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtueof this same shield which was named Killchild. So were they all in their blindfancy, Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, MrDainty Dixon, Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretchedcompany, were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in avery grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill theirsouls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to hisword which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.</p><p>So Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and afterhard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile orthereabout with turf saying the seed won’t sprout, fields athirst, verysadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too. Hard to breathe andall the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as noman remembered to be without. The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobsand on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at firstfire. All the world saying, for aught they knew, the big wind of last Februarya year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside thisbarrenness. But by and by, as said, this evening after sundown, the windsitting in the west, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increasedand the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first andafter, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and in abrace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower, themen making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief, womenfolkskipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came. In Ely place,Baggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street aswash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach orfiacre seen about but no more crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon.Mr Justice Fitzgibbon’s door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon thecollege lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman’s gentleman that had but come from MrMoore’s the writer’s (that was a papish but is now, folk say, a goodWilliamite) chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are now in withdance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from Mullingar with thestage where his coz and Mal M’s brother will stay a month yet till SaintSwithin and asks what in the earth he does there, he bound home and he toAndrew Horne’s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine, so he said, but wouldtell him of a skittish heifer, big of her age and beef to the heel, and allthis while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne’s. There Leop.Bloom of Crawford’s journal sitting snug with a covey of wags, likely branglingfellows, Dixon jun., scholar of my lady of Mercy’s, Vin. Lynch, a Scots fellow,Will. Madden, T. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D.Leop. Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamedtonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair ofTurkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and MistressPurefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools,poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can’tdeliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of theinsides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy fromthe knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue. ’Tis her ninth chick tolive, I hear, and Lady day bit off her last chick’s nails that was then atwelvemonth and with other three all breastfed that died written out in a fairhand in the king’s bible. Her hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes thesacrament and is to be seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys offBullock harbour dapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt hehas trailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear. In sum aninfinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase theharvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for aprognostication of Malachi’s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell has done aprophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer’sgazette) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom ofreason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the rightguess with their queerities no telling how.</p><p>With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was inthat night’s gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore withan oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen’s persuasion he gaveover the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk. He wasa kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and whatbelonged of women, horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truthhe was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehousesand low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul’s men, runners, flatcaps,waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with achanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom hepicked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip. He took his ordinary at aboilingcook’s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or aplatter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himselfoff with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that everymother’s son of them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that is,hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank(that was his name), ’tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered alongof the plague. But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with theirbully beef, a pox on it. There’s as good fish in this tin as ever came out ofit and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood bywhich he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeedthe chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset. <i>Mort aux vaches</i>,says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to abrandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like agentleman too. From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, aheadborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the useof the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but hetook the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with thejusticiary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. One time he would be aplayactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from thebearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it onthe roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour ofmoonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He hadbeen off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets asmany more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as hesaw him. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to knowthe drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but this daymorning going to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce believe ’tis sobad, says he. And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers,greasy hoggets and wether wool, having been some years before actuary for MrJoseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock andmeadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street. I question withyou there, says he. More like ’tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen,a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he haddispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking him for thehospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcherin all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns.Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing. He’ll find himself on the horns ofa dilemma if he meddles with a bull that’s Irish, says he. Irish by name andirish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irishbull in an English chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that samebull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreederof them all, with an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincentcross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and aportlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a coat ofcloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that thewomen of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after himhanging his bulliness in daisychains. What for that, says Mr Dixon, but beforehe came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by acollege of doctors who were no better off than himself. So be off now, says he,and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’sblessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slapand the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taughthim a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to thisday affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear inthe dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue thanlie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland.Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shiftand petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clippedhis forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables forhim at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hayin the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content. By thistime the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavythat he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening dames anddamsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly wasfull he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mysteryand roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language and they all after him. Ay,says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in allthe land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind)and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with aprinted notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on theground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommonor the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as ahandful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half thecountryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lordHarry’s orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, andthe lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an oldwhoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I’ll meddle in his matters,says he. I’ll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that goodpizzle my father left me. But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harrywas cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he hadspade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the otherswere to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to abull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry hefound sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous championbull of the Romans, <i>Bos Bovum</i>, which is good bog Latin for boss of theshow. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow’sdrinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out againtold them all his new name. Then, with the water running off him, he got intoan old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought agrammar of the bulls’ language to study but he could never learn a word of itexcept the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heartand if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write itupon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale ofcotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fastfriends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end wasthat the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women wereall of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles ofchattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang theirluff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind andwater, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave threetimes three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to seato recover the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of thecomposing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty:</p><p><i>&mdash;Pope Peter’s but a pissabed.<br/>A man’s a man for a’ that.</i></p><p>Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as thestudents were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he hadjust rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon, who had late cometo town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fenciblesand list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish ofit all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the veryevil that had been touched on. Whereat he handed round to the company a set ofpasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing alegend printed in fair italics: <i>Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser andIncubator. Lambay Island</i>. His project, as he went on to expound, was towithdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business ofsir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself tothe noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. Well, let ushear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it smacks ofwenching. Come, be seated, both. ’Tis as cheap sitting as standing. Mr Mulliganaccepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon his design, told his hearersthat he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes ofsterility, both the inhibitory and the prohibitory, whether the inhibition inits turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance aswell as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or fromproclivities acquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptialcouch defrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeablefemales with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide theirflambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloomin the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply theinlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when ahundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he assured them, made hisheart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which he concluded due to a suppressionof latent heat), having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspectedinto this matter, he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever thefreehold of Lambay island from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Torygentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party. He proposed to setup there a national fertilising farm to be named <i>Omphalos</i> with anobelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutifulyeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soeverwho should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions ofher natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he take a penny for hispains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion, if sobe their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for theirpetitions, would find in him their man. For his nutriment he shewed how hewould feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish andconeys there, the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highlyrecommended for his purpose, both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and apod or two of capsicum chillies. After this homily which he delivered with muchwarmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchiefwith which he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by therain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be observedby Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald.His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and wonhearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary’s excepted to it, asking witha finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulliganhowever made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classicswhich, as it dwelt upon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful supportof his contention: <i>Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites, utmatresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationestestibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopereanteponunt</i>, while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point byanalogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach, the buck anddoe of the forest glade, the farmyard drake and duck.</p><p>Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper man ofperson, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions ofsome heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavishedtheir encomiums upon the project he had advanced. The young gentleman, hisfriend, overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him, could notforbear to tell it his nearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving thetable, asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, hemade him a civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professionalassistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very heartily,though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was come there abouta lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was in an interesting condition,poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he fetched a deep sigh) to know if herhappiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon, to turn the table, took on to ask ofMr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence, upon which he ralliedhim, betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb orwas due, as with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in thestomach. For answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smotehimself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll mimicof Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though ’tis pity she’sa trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a bastard. This was so happy aconceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into themost violent agitations of delight. The spry rattle had run on in the same veinof mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber.</p><p>Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little fume ofa fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the younggentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient point, having desiredhis visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon ofcordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head (a wholecentury of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture) to which wasunited an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator asplainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it.<i>Mais bien sûr</i>, noble stranger, said he cheerily, <i>et millecompliments</i>. That you may and very opportunely. There wanted nothing butthis cup to crown my felicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but acrust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would acceptof them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanksto the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of goodthings. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took acomplacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his bosom, outpopped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very picture which he hadcherished ever since her hand had wrote therein. Gazing upon those featureswith a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he said, had you but beheld her as Idid with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and hernew coquette cap (a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily) in such anartless disorder, of so melting a tenderness, ’pon my conscience, even you,Monsieur, had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly intothe hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I wasnever so touched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours.A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having replaced thelocket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again. Beneficent Disseminatorof blessings to all Thy creatures, how great and universal must be thatsweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond, thesimple swain and the polished coxcomb, the lover in the heyday of recklesspassion and the husband of maturer years. But indeed, sir, I wander from thepoint. How mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! heexclaimed in anguish. Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to takemy cloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured sevenshowers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me, he cried,clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and, thousandthunders, I know of a <i>marchand de capotes</i>, Monsieur Poyntz, from whom Ican have for a <i>livre</i> as snug a cloak of the French fashion as ever kepta lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le Fécondateur, tripping in, my friendMonsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller (I have just cracked a halfbottle <i>avec lui</i> in a circle of the best wits of the town), is myauthority that in Cape Horn, <i>ventre biche</i>, they have a rain that willwet through any, even the stoutest cloak. A drenching of that violence, hetells me, <i>sans blague</i>, has sent more than one luckless fellow in goodearnest posthaste to another world. Pooh! A <i>livre!</i> cries Monsieur Lynch.The clumsy things are dear at a sou. One umbrella, were it no bigger than afairy mushroom, is worth ten such stopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one.My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever shewould starve in such an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushingpiquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words butgiddy butterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it inour hearts and it has become a household word that <i>il y a deux choses</i>for which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a breachof the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. The first, said she(and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her tilbury, to fix myattention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear), thefirst is a bath... But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short adiscourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store ofknowledge.</p><p>Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while allwere conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and, havingspoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with a profound bowto the company. The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of awoman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautifulrefrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departurewas the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, alow fellow who was fuddled. A monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I’ll be sworn shehas rendezvoused you. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad’s bud,immensely so, said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in theMater hospice. Demme, does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under thechin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid thereany time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young blood in theprimrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of hisbody, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless me, I’m all of a wibblywobbly. Why, you’re as bad as dear little Father Cantekissem, that you are! Maythis pot of four half choke me, cried Costello, if she aint in the family way.I knows a lady what’s got a white swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. Theyoung surgeon, however, rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat asthe nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward. Mercifulprovidence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady whowas <i>enceinte</i> which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she hadgiven birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those who,without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling professionwhich, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest power forhappiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if need were I couldproduce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitationswhich, so far from being a byword, should be a glorious incentive in the humanbreast. I cannot away with them. What? Malign such an one, the amiable MissCallan, who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours? And atan instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish thethought! I shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of suchmalice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother andmaid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he salutedthose present on the by and repaired to the door. A murmur of approval arosefrom all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado, a designwhich would have been effected nor would he have received more than his baredeserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horridimprecation (for he swore a round hand) that he was as good a son of the truefold as ever drew breath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was always thesentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular tohonour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or ahasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.</p><p>To revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of someimpudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that ageupon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. The young sparks, itis true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words oftheir tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice:their testiness and outrageous <i>mots</i> were such that his intellectsresiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties thoughtheir fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of MrCostello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch thatseemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out ofwedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world,which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, soas to put him in thought of that missing link of creation’s chain desideratedby the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now for more than the middle span ofour allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes ofexistence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, hehad enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, byintercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast thatplenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and allfind tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create themselves wits at thecost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) tothem he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of aproper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose nomore, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolencyto beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel withmettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlingsof the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it)for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanityupon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawfuloccasions. To conclude, while from the sister’s words he had reckoned upon aspeedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated bythe intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duressnow testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the SupremeBeing.</p><p>Accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express hisnotion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express one) wasthat one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoicedby this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been insuch pain through no fault of hers. The dressy young blade said it was herhusband’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unlessshe were another Ephesian matron. I must acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers,clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old GloryAllelujurum was round again today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferringthrough his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he callsher. I bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.’Slife, I’ll be round with you. I cannot but extol the virile potency of theold bucko that could still knock another child out of her. All fell to praisingof it, each after his own fashion, though the same young blade held with hisformer view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap, aclerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or an itinerant vendor of articles neededin every household. Singular, communed the guest with himself, the wonderfullyunequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperaldormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of suchfrivolity, that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice totransform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplarypractitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed thenoblest. But, he further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelingsthat in common oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of afeather laugh together.</p><p>But with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron, has thisalien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights,constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity? Where is nowthat gratitude which loyalty should have counselled? During the recent warwhenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitorto his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire ofwhich he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four percents? Has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it thatfrom being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is, ifreport belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from candour toviolate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of a gallant major,or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challengesattention there (as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done) then beit so. Unhappy woman, she has been too long and too persistently denied herlegitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feelingthan the derision of the desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a verypelican in his piety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, toattempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strataof society! Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel, ithad gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the question of thegrazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in Mr Cuffe’s hearingbrought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in termsas straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill becomes him to preach thatgospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of theploughshare? A habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and anopprobrium in middle life. If he must dispense his balm of Gilead in nostrumsand apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledgedprofligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engrosshim. His marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctantto adduce. The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for aconsort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer ofills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in its native orient,throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but, transplanted to a climemore temperate, its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff thatcomes away from it is stagnant, acid and inoperative.</p><p>The news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage ofthe Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medicalofficer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heirhad been born. When he had betaken himself to the women’s apartment to assistat the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretaryof state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent inunanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the lengthand solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence wouldpalliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetricianrendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. In vain thevoice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, torefrain. The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursivenesswhich seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. Every phase ofthe situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterinebrothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and,that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as theChilds Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr AdvocateBushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights ofprimogeniture and king’s bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages andinfanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac <i>foetus in foetu</i>and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen(cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of themaxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hearwhat the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, theprolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure onthe vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in theactual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificialinsemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon themenopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case offemales impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of deliverycalled by the Brandenburghers <i>Sturzgeburt,</i> the recorded instances ofmultiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenicperiod or of consanguineous parents&mdash;in a word all the cases of humannativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece withchromolithographic illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics andforensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popularbeliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman tostep over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangleher creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardentlyand ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of herperson which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. Theabnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro’s inkle,strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a <i>prima facie</i>and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of MadameGrissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. Thehypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy ofthe metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such casesan arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. Anoutlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat asalmost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the malesof brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such asthat of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed downto us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words wasimmediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by anallocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which nonebetter than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object ofdesire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisenbetween Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical andtheological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing theother, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom forinstant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether thebetter to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb withwhich he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered brieflyand, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding manto put asunder what God has joined.</p><p>But Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up the scenebefore them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in the recessappeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep! He had aportfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other a phial marked<i>Poison.</i> Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all faces while heeyed them with a ghostly grin. I anticipated some such reception, he began withan eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history is to blame. Yes, it is true. Iam the murderer of Samuel Childs. And how I am punished! The inferno has noterrors for me. This is the appearance is on me. Tare and ages, what way wouldI be resting at all, he muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while backwith my share of songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or abullawurrus? My hell, and Ireland’s, is in this life. It is what I tried toobliterate my crime. Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recitedsome), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out. In vain! Hisspectre stalks me. Dope is my only hope... Ah! Destruction! The black panther!With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back. An instant later hishead appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet me at Westland Row station atten past eleven. He was gone. Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipatedhost. The seer raised his hand to heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun!The sage repeated: <i>Lex talionis</i>. The sentimentalist is he who wouldenjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done. Malachias,overcome by emotion, ceased. The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the thirdbrother. His real name was Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost ofhis own father. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks. Thelonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there. Thespider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from his hole.A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer’s ground.</p><p>What is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the chameleon tochange her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the merry and mournfulwith the downcast, so too is her age changeable as her mood. No longer isLeopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing the cud of reminiscence, thatstaid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds. A scoreof years are blown away. He is young Leopold. There, as in a retrospectivearrangement, a mirror within a mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself.That young figure of then is seen, precociously manly, walking on a nippingmorning from the old house in Clanbrassil street to the high school, hisbooksatchel on him bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, amother’s thought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in hisfirst hard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledgedtraveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scentedhandkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas! a thingnow of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this or that halfwonhousewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for a budding virgin, shylyacknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his studied baisemoins. The scent, thesmile, but, more than these, the dark eyes and oleaginous address, brought homeat duskfall many a commission to the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s pipeafter like labours in the paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure,is aheating), reading through round horned spectacles some paper from theEurope of a month before. But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and theyoung knighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the mist.Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his sons. Who can say?The wise father knows his own child. He thinks of a drizzling night in Hatchstreet, hard by the bonded stores there, the first. Together (she is a poorwaif, a child of shame, yours and mine and of all for a bare shilling and herluckpenny), together they hear the heavy tread of the watch as two raincapedshadows pass the new royal university. Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will neverforget the name, ever remember the night: first night, the bridenight.

No son of thy loins is by thee. There isnone now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.</p><p>The voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the infinite ofspace: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions of cycles ofgenerations that have lived. A region where grey twilight ever descends, neverfalls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her dusk, scattering aperennial dew of stars. She follows her mother with ungainly steps, a mareleading her fillyfoal. Twilight phantoms are they, yet moulded in propheticgrace of structure, slim shapely haunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meekapprehensive skull. They fade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a wasteland, a home of screechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is nomore. And on the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder ofrebellion, the ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind andgoads them, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. Elk andyak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they cometrooping to the sunken sea, <i>Lacus Mortis</i>. Ominous revengeful zodiacalhost! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the trumpetedwith the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter and crawler, rodent,ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning multitude, murderers of thesun.</p><p>Onward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horriblegulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portent growsagain, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s own magnitude, tillit looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo, wonder of metempsychosis, itis she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the daystar, the bride, evervirgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost one, Millicent, the young, the dear, theradiant. How serene does she now arise, a queen among the Pleiades, in thepenultimate antelucan hour, shod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veilof what do you call it gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn fleshand loose it streams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained oncurrents of the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling,writhing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad metamorphosesof symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign upon the forehead ofTaurus.</p><p>Francis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at schooltogether in Conmee’s time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades, Pisistratus.Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the past and itsphantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them into life across thewaters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to my call? Who supposes it? I,Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending bard, am lord and giver of their life.He encircled his gadding hair with a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent.That answer and those leaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitlywhen something more, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can callyour genius father. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to seeyou bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. I heartilywish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying a hand on theshoulder near him. Have no fear. He could not leave his mother an orphan. Theyoung man’s face grew dark. All could see how hard it was for him to bereminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He would have withdrawn fromthe feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart. Madden had lost fivedrachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider’s name: Lenehan as much more. Hetold them of the race. The flag fell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran outfreshly with O. Madden up. She was leading the field. All hearts were beating.Even Phyllis could not contain herself. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah!Sceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close orderthe dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All was lostnow. Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she cried, I amundone. But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright casket of gold inwhich lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. A tear fell: one only. Awhacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane. Four winners yesterday and threetoday. What rider is like him? Mount him on the camel or the boisterous buffalothe victory in a hack canter is still his. But let us bear it as was theancient wont. Mercy on the luckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh.She is not the filly that she was. Never, by this hand, shall we behold suchanother. By gad, sir, a queen of them. Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish youcould have seen my queen today, Vincent said. How young she was and radiant(Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin, Ido not know the right name of it. The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom:the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us. Inthe sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those bunswith Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near thebridge. But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her andin that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close. A week ago she layill, four days on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.She is more taking then. Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had pulledher fill as we reclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you will notthink who met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was walking by thehedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not, a witty letter in itfrom Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet creature turned all coloursin her confusion, feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress: a slip ofunderwood clung there for the very trees adore her. When Conmee had passed sheglanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries. But he had beenkind. In going by he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said.If I had poor luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve memore propensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it andwithheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label. Warily,Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far away. It is aspainful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be born. Any object,intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of thegods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos told me so, Stephen answered,whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries ofkarmic law. The lords of the moon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shiploadfrom planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles andthese were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the secondconstellation.</p><p>However, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him beingin some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely dueto a misconception of the shallowest character, was not the case at all. Theindividual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at thisjuncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if notastuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary wouldhave found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop. During the past fourminutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of numberone Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to besituated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which wascertainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its scarletappearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently transpired for reasonsbest known to himself, which put quite an altogether different complexion onthe proceedings, after the moment before’s observations about boyhood days andthe turf, recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which theother two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however,both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other wasendeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to helphim himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsizedglass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacioushole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the same time, however, aconsiderable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer thatwas in it about the place.</p><p>The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the courseof life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The debaters werethe keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and mostvital. The high hall of Horne’s house had never beheld an assembly sorepresentative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment everlistened to a language so encyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made.Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, hisface glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, oppositeto him, was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of earlydepravity and premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned toCostello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose thesquat form of Madden. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before thehearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer’s kit oftweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primroseelegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan. Lastly at thehead of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours ofpedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socraticdiscussion, while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippantprognosticator, fresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiledby the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelibledishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril orthreat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous lovelinesswhich the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come.</p><p>It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the pervertedtranscendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus’ (Div. Scep.) contentions would appearto prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientificmethods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated, deals with tangiblephenomena. The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheadedfacts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can. There may be, itis true, some questions which science cannot answer&mdash;at present&mdash;suchas the first problem submitted by Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding thefuture determination of sex. Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacriathat the right ovary (the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsiblefor the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemaspermsthe differentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to opine,such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig, Leopold and Valenti,a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to a cooperation (one of nature’sfavourite devices) between the <i>nisus formativus</i> of the nemasperm on theone hand and on the other a happily chosen position, <i>succubitus felix</i>,of the passive element. The other problem raised by the same inquirer isscarcely less vital: infant mortality. It is interesting because, as hepertinently remarks, we are all born in the same way but we all die indifferent ways. Mr M. Mulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitaryconditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonarycomplaints etc. by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, healleged, and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicityposters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers andsailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of dead animals,paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas&mdash;these, he said, wereaccountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race. Kalipedia,he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life,genuinely good music, agreeable literature, light philosophy, instructivepictures, plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as Venus andApollo, artistic coloured photographs of prize babies, all these littleattentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass theintervening months in a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.)attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of womenworkers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline inthe home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official,culminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminalabortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former (we arethinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nursesforgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to benormative. In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so manypregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do, all things considered andin spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions.An ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) thatboth natality and mortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidalmovements, lunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything,in fine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun tothe blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parksis subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained. Still the plainstraightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seeminglya healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in earlychildhood (though other children of the same marriage do not) must certainly,in the poet’s words, give us pause. Nature, we may rest assured, has her owngood and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability suchdeaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbousgerms have taken up their residence (modern science has conclusively shown thatonly the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at anincreasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, thoughproductive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), isnevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the race ingeneral in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S. Dedalus’ (Div.Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?) that an omnivorousbeing which can masticate, deglute, digest and apparently pass through theordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious alimentsas cancrenous females emaciated by parturition, corpulent professionalgentlemen, not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, mightpossibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob,reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency abovealluded to. For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquaintedwith the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete andembryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in thingsscientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself onbeing, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance ofour lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh ofa calf newly dropped from its mother. In a recent public controversy with Mr L.Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took place in the commons’ hall of the NationalMaternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, DrA. Horne (Lic. in Midw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, heis reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the catinto the bag (an esthete’s allusion, presumably, to one of the most complicatedand marvellous of all nature’s processes&mdash;the act of sexual congress) shemust let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it, to save her own. Atthe risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor, none theless effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered.</p><p>Meanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a happy<i>accouchement.</i> It had been a weary weary while both for patient anddoctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman hadmanfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and now she was veryvery happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone before, are happy too asthey gaze down and smile upon the touching scene. Reverently look at her as shereclines there with the motherlight in her eyes, that longing hunger for babyfingers (a pretty sight it is to see), in the first bloom of her newmotherhood, breathing a silent prayer of thanksgiving to One above, theUniversal Husband. And as her loving eyes behold her babe she wishes only oneblessing more, to have her dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to layin his arms that mite of God’s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He isolder now (you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yetin the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious secondaccountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch. O Doady, loved one of old,faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that faroff time of the roses!With the old shake of her pretty head she recalls those days. God! Howbeautiful now across the mist of years! But their children are grouped in herimagination about the bedside, hers and his, Charley, Mary Alice, FrederickAlbert (if he had lived), Mamy, Budgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet ConstanceLouisa, darling little Bobsy (called after our famous hero of the South Africanwar, lord Bobs of Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of theirunion, a Purefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Younghopeful will be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousinof Mr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer’s office, Dublin Castle. And so timewags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No, let no sigh break fromthat bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the ashes from your pipe, theseasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for you (may it be thedistant day!) and dout the light whereby you read in the Sacred Book for theoil too has run low, and so with a tranquil heart to bed, to rest. He knows andwill call in His own good time. You too have fought the good fight and playedloyally your man’s part. Sir, to you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithfulservant!</p><p>There are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil memorieswhich are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abidethere and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow dim, let them be as thoughthey had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at leastwere otherwise. Yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they willrise up to confront him in the most various circumstances, a vision or a dream,or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquilityof the evening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.Not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under herwrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in thepiteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.</p><p>The stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of thatfalse calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied trick, uponwords so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness, a<i>flair,</i> for the cruder things of life. A scene disengages itself in theobserver’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by a word of so natural a homelinessas if those days were really present there (as some thought) with theirimmediate pleasures. A shaven space of lawn one soft May evening, thewellremembered grove of lilacs at Roundtown, purple and white, fragrant slenderspectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they runslowly forward over the sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with abrief alert shock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves attimes in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey,Atty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in herpose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent from anear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the coolardent fruit. A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey (blossomtime but therewill be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered andhutched) is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands.He frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too consciousenjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where hismother watches from the <i>piazzetta</i> giving upon the flowerclose with afaint shadow of remoteness or of reproach (<i>alles Vergängliche</i>) in herglad look.</p><p>Mark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that antechamberof birth where the studious are assembled and note their faces. Nothing, as itseems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of custody, rather, befitting theirstation in that house, the vigilant watch of shepherds and of angels about acrib in Bethlehem of Juda long ago. But as before the lightning the serriedstormclouds, heavy with preponderant excess of moisture, in swollen massesturgidly distended, compass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending aboveparched field and drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till inan instant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of thethunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was thetransformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the word.</p><p>Burke’s! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and bobtail ofall them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor, punctual Bloom atheels with a universal grabbing at headgear, ashplants, bilbos, Panama hats andscabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and what not.

His (Stephen’s) mind wasnot exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on hisexpressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it wasand there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alonedrinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, thepropriety of the cabman’s shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow awaynear Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of amilk and soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce hewas rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him totake some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means duringwhich Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather pale inthe face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance ofsome description which would answer in their then condition, both of them beinge.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to befound. Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of hishaving forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had doneyeoman service in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaverstreet or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and the distinctly fetidatmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where theymade tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by thecorner of Dan Bergin’s. But as he confidently anticipated there was not a signof a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probablyengaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel andthere was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who wasanything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kindof a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.</p><p>This was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently therewas nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which theyaccordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the Signal House whichthey shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens streetrailway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one ofthe back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone theway of all buttons though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, heheroically made light of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularlypressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since itcleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered alongpast by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As itso happened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s sandstrewer happened to bereturning and the elder man recounted to his companion <i>à propos</i> of theincident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They passedthe main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point forBelfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour andpassing the backdoor of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to saygruesome to a degree, more especially at night) ultimately gained the DockTavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C divisionpolice station. Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses ofBeresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird’s thestonecutter’s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the right,while the other who was acting as his <i>fidus Achates</i> inhaled withinternal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke’s city bakery, situated quiteclose to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread,of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, thestaff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread, at Rourke’s thebaker’s it is said.</p><p><i>En route</i> to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yetperfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possessionof his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word ofcaution <i>re</i> the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swellmobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitualpractice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his ageparticularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquorunless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on thebroad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn’t look out. Highlyprovidential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen wasblissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventhhour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for theaccident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and an appearance in the courtnext day before Mr Tobias or, he being the solicitor rather, old Wall, he meantto say, or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about.The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom hecordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crownand, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division inClanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never onthe spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for example,the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being theywere paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on wasequipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to gooff at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians shouldby any chance they fall out over anything. You frittered away your time, hevery sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which, thesquandermania of the thing, fast women of the <i>demimonde</i> ran away with alot of £. s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you gotdrunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relisheda glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking andpossessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunchbeliever in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew theline as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at thetender mercy of others practically. Most of all he commented adversely on thedesertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting <i>confrères</i> but one, a mostglaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all thecircs.</p><p>&mdash;And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothingwhatsoever of any kind.</p><p>Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of theCustomhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of cokeburning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their ratherlagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason tolook at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from thebrazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchmaninside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happenedor had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effortbefore he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a <i>quondam</i> friendof his father’s, Gumley. To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars ofthe railway bridge.</p><p>&mdash;Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.</p><p>A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches salutedagain, calling:</p><p>&mdash;Night!</p><p>Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment.Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he alwaysbelieved in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the<i>qui vive</i> with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least.Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknownfor desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying andgenerally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their headin some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thamesembankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders readyto decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment’snotice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged andgarrotted.</p><p>Stephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though hewas not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s breath redolent ofrotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came aboutin this wise. He was the eldest son of inspector Corley of the G division,lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of aLouth farmer. His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had marriedthe widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also)Talbot. Rumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house ofthe lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fineresidence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or somerelative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed thedistinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This therefore was thereason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressedStephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.</p><p>Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not asmuch as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings. His friends had all desertedhim. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a meanbloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions. Hewas out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God’s earth hecould get something, anything at all, to do. No, it was the daughter of themother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house orelse they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrenceshappening at the same time if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabricationfrom start to finish. Anyhow he was all in.</p><p>&mdash;I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I’mon the rocks.</p><p>&mdash;There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You maymention my name.</p><p>&mdash;Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man. I wasnever one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck twice inthe junior at the christian brothers.</p><p>&mdash;I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.</p><p>Corley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to do withStephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off thestreet. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney’s, but it wasonly a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M’Conachie told him you got adecent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which wasdistantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He wasstarving too though he hadn’t said a word about it.</p><p>Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it stillStephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew thatCorley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving ofmuch credence. However <i>haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere discoetcetera</i> as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he gotpaid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was thedate of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal wasdemolished. But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley’shead that he was living in affluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out theneedful. Whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea offinding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob orso in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eatbut the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cashmissing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation. Hetried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well hemight have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout,very much the reverse in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute athorough search though he tried to recollect. About biscuits he dimlyremembered. Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy.However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark werepennies, erroneously however, as it turned out.</p><p>&mdash;Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.</p><p>And so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him one ofthem.</p><p>&mdash;Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman. I’ll pay you back one time.Who’s that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camdenstreet with Boylan, the billsticker. You might put in a good word for us to getme taken on there. I’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office toldme they’re full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you’ve to book ahead,man, you’d think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don’t give a shite anyway so longas I get a job, even as a crossing sweeper.</p><p>Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he gothe informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he saidStephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s, bookkeeper there thatused to be often round in Nagle’s back with O’Mara and a little chap with astutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and finedten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.</p><p>Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of thecobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman’ssentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quietforty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account whileDublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen’sanything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that noblemansomewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully statenor had he the remotest idea when. Being a levelheaded individual who couldgive points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on hisvery dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to achronic impecuniosity. Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matterof that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour allround, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of thatif the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude withor without the option of a fine would be a very <i>rara avis</i> altogether. Inany case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people atthat hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.</p><p>The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his practisedeye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence ofthe other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen,that is:</p><p>&mdash;He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody namedBoylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.</p><p>At this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloomgazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of abucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongsideCustomhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair, whereupon he observedevasively:</p><p>&mdash;Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention ithis face was familiar to me. But, leaving that for the moment, how much did youpart with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?</p><p>&mdash;Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleepsomewhere.</p><p>&mdash;Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at theintelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariablydoes. Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds. But,talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleepyourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of the question. And even supposing youdid you won’t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station. Simply fagout there for nothing. I don’t mean to presume to dictate to you in theslightest degree but why did you leave your father’s house?</p><p>&mdash;To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer.</p><p>&mdash;I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloomdiplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, onyesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course ofconversation that he had moved.</p><p>&mdash;I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.Why?</p><p>&mdash;A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects thanone and a born <i>raconteur</i> if ever there was one. He takes great pride,quite legitimate, out of you. You could go back perhaps, he hasarded, stillthinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it wasperfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that Englishtourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, werepatently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephenthe slip in the confusion, which they did.</p><p>There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it was,Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearththe last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle, her hairhanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in thesootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with theoatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a pennywith an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under themangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on asquare of brown paper, in accordance with the third precept of the church tofast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, emberdays or something like that.</p><p>&mdash;No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust inthat boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan,as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes. He knows which sidehis bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it isto be without regular meals. Of course you didn’t notice as much as I did. Butit wouldn’t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco orsome narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.</p><p>He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatileallround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming tothe fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy aflourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medicalpractitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to whichprofessional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificialrespiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was,he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highlypraise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reasoncould be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness orjealousy, pure and simple.</p><p>&mdash;Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call pickingyour brains, he ventured to throw out.</p><p>The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendlinesswhich he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression of features did notthrow a flood of light, none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he hadlet himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks helet drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason orother best known to himself allowed matters to more or less. Grinding povertydid have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educationalabilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in makingboth ends meet.</p><p>Adjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round whicha group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid ofvoluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way,there being some little differences between the parties.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!</i></p><p><i>&mdash;Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano più...</i></p><p><i>&mdash;Dice lui, però!</i></p><p><i>&mdash;Mezzo.</i></p><p><i>&mdash;Farabutto! Mortacci sui!</i></p><p><i>&mdash;Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più...</i></p><p>Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious woodenstructure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been before, the formerhaving previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of itsaid to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat Fitzharris, the invincible, though hecould not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not onevestige of truth in. A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seatedin a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedlymiscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens ofthe genus <i>homo</i> already there engaged in eating and drinking diversifiedby conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.</p><p>&mdash;Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest tobreak the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape ofsolid food, say, a roll of some description.</p><p>Accordingly his first act was with characteristic <i>sangfroid</i> to orderthese commodities quietly. The <i>hoi polloi</i> of jarvies or stevedores orwhatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparentlydissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual, portion of whosehair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for some appreciable timebefore transferring his rapt attention to the floor. Mr Bloom, availing himselfof the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with thelanguage in dispute, though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over<i>voglio</i>, remarked to his <i>protégé</i> in an audible tone of voice <i>àpropos</i> of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast andfurious:</p><p>&mdash;A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not writeyour poetry in that language? <i>Bella Poetria</i>! It is so melodious andfull. <i>Belladonna. Voglio.</i></p><p>Stephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering fromlassitude generally, replied:</p><p>&mdash;To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.</p><p>&mdash;Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at theinward reflection of there being more languages to start with than wereabsolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.</p><p>The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this <i>tête-à-tête</i> put aboiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and arather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. After which he beat aretreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at himlater on so as not to appear to. For which reason he encouraged Stephen toproceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing thecup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.</p><p>&mdash;Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,like names. Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle.Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What’s in a name?</p><p>&mdash;Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our namewas changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.</p><p>The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen,whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking:</p><p>&mdash;And what might your name be?</p><p>Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but Stephen,apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter, answered:</p><p>&mdash;Dedalus.</p><p>The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, ratherbunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.</p><p>&mdash;You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.</p><p>&mdash;I’ve heard of him, Stephen said.</p><p>Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdroppingtoo.</p><p>&mdash;He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same wayand nodding. All Irish.</p><p>&mdash;All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.</p><p>As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and hewas just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his ownaccord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark:</p><p>&mdash;I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over hisshoulder. The lefthand dead shot.</p><p>Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures beingalso clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.</p><p>&mdash;Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles. Cockshis gun over his shoulder. Aims.</p><p>He turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then hescrewed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with anunprepossessing cast of countenance.</p><p>&mdash;Pom! he then shouted once.</p><p>The entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there beingstill a further egg.</p><p>&mdash;Pom! he shouted twice.</p><p>Egg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily:</p><p><i>&mdash;Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,<br/>Never missed nor he never will.</i></p><p>A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like askinghim whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.</p><p>&mdash;Beg pardon, the sailor said.</p><p>&mdash;Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.</p><p>&mdash;Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magicinfluence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He touredthe wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus. I seen him do that in Stockholm.</p><p>&mdash;Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.</p><p>&mdash;Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe. Knowwhere that is?</p><p>&mdash;Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.</p><p>&mdash;That’s right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That’swhere I hails from. I belongs there. That’s where I hails from. My littlewoman’s down there. She’s waiting for me, I know. <i>For England, home andbeauty</i>. She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years now, sailingabout.</p><p>Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming to themariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones, a rainy night witha blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a number of stories there wereon that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle anddoes anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O’Leary, a favourite and most tryingdeclamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry inits own small way. Never about the runaway wife coming back, however muchdevoted to the absentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment whenhe finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent hisbetter half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but I’ve come tostay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grasswidow, at the selfsamefireside. Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the deep. And there sitsuncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown andAnchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. No chair for father.Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, <i>post mortem</i> child.With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to theinevitable. Grin and bear it. I remain with much love your brokenheartedhusband W. B. Murphy.</p><p>The sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of thejarvies with the request:</p><p>&mdash;You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?</p><p>The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plugfrom his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed fromhand to hand.</p><p>&mdash;Thank you, the sailor said.</p><p>He deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow stammers,proceeded:</p><p>&mdash;We come up this morning eleven o’clock. The threemaster <i>Rosevean</i>from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this afternoon.There’s my discharge. See? D. B. Murphy. A. B. S.</p><p>In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket andhanded to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.</p><p>&mdash;You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,leaning on the counter.</p><p>&mdash;Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated abit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and NorthAmerica and South America. We was chased by pirates one voyage. I seen icebergsplenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles underCaptain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I seen Russia.<i>Gospodi pomilyou</i>. That’s how the Russians prays.</p><p>&mdash;You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.</p><p>&mdash;Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen queerthings too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor sameas I chew that quid.</p><p>He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bitferociously:</p><p>&mdash;Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and thelivers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.</p><p>He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be inits way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. The printedmatter on it stated: <i>Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.</i></p><p>All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage women instriped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping amid aswarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside someprimitive shanties of osier.</p><p>&mdash;Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs likebreadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more children.</p><p>See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver raw.</p><p>His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns forseveral minutes if not more.</p><p>&mdash;Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.</p><p>Nobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:</p><p>&mdash;Glass. That boggles ’em. Glass.</p><p>Mr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card toperuse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as follows:<i>Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile.</i> Therewas no message evidently, as he took particular notice. Though not an implicitbeliever in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for thatmatter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incidentdepicted in <i>Maritana</i> on which occasion the former’s ball passed throughthe latter’s hat) having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming hewas the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false coloursafter having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitiousaddressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend’s<i>bona fides</i> nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished planhe meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London<i>via</i> long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to anygreat extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate hehad consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead whichwas his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass throughEgan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net resultthat the scheme fell through. But even suppose it did come to planking down theneedful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a fewguineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured ongoing was five and six, there and back. The trip would benefit health onaccount of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable,especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different placesalong the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in aninstructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of ourmodern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower,abbey, wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing juststruck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on thespot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summermusic embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathingand firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on,beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which mightprove highly remunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratchcompany or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me yourvalise and I’ll post you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star Irishcaste, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort asleading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners,perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffsin the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce whocould pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure. Butwho? That was the rub.</p><p>Also, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to beopened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times<i>apropos</i> of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was oncemore on the <i>tapis</i> in the circumlocution departments with the usualquantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheadsgenerally. A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise tomeet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e. Brown,Robinson and Co.</p><p>It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no smallblame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system reallyneeded toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred fromseeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever coopedup since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife. After all, hang it, theyhad their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of<i>venue</i> after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice whendame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a newlease of life. There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists inthe home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethoraof attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublinand its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram,but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow, rightly termed thegarden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as itdidn’t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the<i>coup d’œil</i> was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was noteasily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that itmight be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth withits historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, GeorgeIV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite hauntwith all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men’sfancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by designor accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only aboutthree quarters of an hour’s run from the pillar. Because of course uptodatetourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and theaccommodation left much to be desired. Interesting to fathom it seemed to himfrom a motive of curiosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the trafficthat created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned backthe other side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.</p><p>&mdash;I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had littlepills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pillwas something different. One was a ship, another was a house, another was aflower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the chinks does.</p><p>Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotterwent on, adhering to his adventures.</p><p>&mdash;And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in hisback. Knife like that.</p><p>Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping withhis character and held it in the striking position.</p><p>&mdash;In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. Fellowhid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. <i>Prepare to meet yourGod</i>, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.</p><p>His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questionseven should they by any chance want to.</p><p>&mdash;That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable<i>stiletto</i>.</p><p>After which harrowing <i>dénouement</i> sufficient to appal the stoutest hesnapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in hischamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.</p><p>&mdash;They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite inthe dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought the parkmurders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them usingknives.</p><p>At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of <i>where ignorance isbliss</i> Mr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctivelyexchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly <i>entrenous</i> variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, <i>alias</i> the keeper,not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. Hisinscrutable face which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself,beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn’t understand onejot of what was going on. Funny, very!</p><p>There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading in fits and starts astained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the natives <i>chozade</i>, another the seaman’s discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he was personallyconcerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividly recollected when theoccurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, roughly some score ofyears previously in the days of the land troubles, when it took the civilisedworld by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to becorrect, when he was just turned fifteen.</p><p>&mdash;Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.</p><p>The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.</p><p>&mdash;Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.</p><p>The sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or no.</p><p>&mdash;Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking hehad, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but hefailed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shookhis head with a sort of lazy scorn.</p><p>&mdash;What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall theboats?</p><p>Our <i>soi-disant</i> sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering:</p><p>&mdash;I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.Salt junk all the time.</p><p>Tired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was not likely toget a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell towoolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe, sufficeit to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully threefourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule thewaves. On more than one occasion, a dozen at the lowest, near the North Bull atDollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seatedhabitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quiteobliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new assomeone somewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had triedto find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes andall that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under, temptingthe fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about itat all. Nevertheless, without going into the <i>minutiae</i> of the business,the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in thenatural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in theface of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrivedto load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and thelottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that forthat very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institutionto which the public at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as thecase might be, having it brought home to them like that should extend itsgratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man therigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when dutycalled <i>Ireland expects that every man</i> and so on and sometimes had aterrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish andothers, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding which he once with hisdaughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.</p><p>&mdash;There was a fellow sailed with me in the <i>Rover</i>, the old seadog,himself a rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’svalet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I’ve on me and he gave me anoilskin and that jackknife. I’m game for that job, shaving and brushup. I hateroaming about. There’s my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got himtook in a draper’s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.</p><p>&mdash;What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side,bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from thecarking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strongsuspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.</p><p>&mdash;Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?He’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.</p><p>The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt withhis two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an imagetattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor.</p><p>&mdash;There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts. Imust get a wash tomorrow or next day. It’s them black lads I objects to. I hatethose buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.</p><p>Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirtmore open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner’s hope andrest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man’s sideface lookingfrowningly rather.</p><p>&mdash;Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were lyingbecalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow, the name ofAntonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.</p><p>&mdash;Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.</p><p>That worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the. Someway inhis. Squeezing or.</p><p>&mdash;See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. Andthere he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers,some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.</p><p>And in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did actually looklike forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration ofeverybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this time stretched over.</p><p>&mdash;Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He’s gonetoo. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.</p><p>He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression ofbefore.</p><p>&mdash;Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.</p><p>&mdash;And what’s the number for? loafer number two queried.</p><p>&mdash;Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.</p><p>&mdash;Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time withsome sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of thequestioner about the number. Ate. A Greek he was.</p><p>And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end:</p><p class="poem">&mdash;As bad as old Antonio,<br/>For he left me on my ownio.</p><p>The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peeredaskew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with theobject of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which wayto look, turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm, and, pickingup from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, ifsuch he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of thepaper though why pink. His reason for so doing was he recognised on the momentround the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoonon Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane who knew thelady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.) and begged the chance ofhis washing. Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not, your washing.Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife’s undergarmentswhen soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man’s similargarments initialled with Bewley and Draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is)if they really loved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Stilljust then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than hercompany so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign totake herself off. Round the side of the <i>Evening Telegraph</i> he just caughta fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind ofdemented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing withevident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy’s nautical chest andthen there was no more of her.</p><p>&mdash;The gunboat, the keeper said.</p><p>&mdash;It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, howa wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease canbe barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he valueshis health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course I suppose some man isultimately responsible for her condition. Still no matter what the cause isfrom...</p><p>Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:</p><p>&mdash;In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaringtrade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul. Sheis a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.</p><p>The elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, saidit was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to<i>instanter</i> to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from anyoldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensedand medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he could truthfullystate, he, as a <i>paterfamilias</i>, was a stalwart advocate of from the veryfirst start. Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort, he said, and ventilatedthe matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.</p><p>&mdash;You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believein the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, asdistinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I believe inthat myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutionsof the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays,for instance. Do you?</p><p>Thus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try andconcentrate and remember before he could say:</p><p>&mdash;They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance andtherefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for thepossibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I can hear, isquite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes,<i>corruptio per se</i> and <i>corruptio per accidens</i> both being excludedby court etiquette.</p><p>Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mysticalfinesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound toenter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:</p><p>&mdash;Simple? I shouldn’t think that is the proper word. Of course, I grantyou, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon.But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to inventthose rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it wasbefore his time Galileo was the man, I mean, and the same applies to the laws,for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it’s ahorse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of asupernatural God.</p><p>&mdash;O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several ofthe bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence.</p><p>On this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they wereboth in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in theirrespective ages, clashed.</p><p>&mdash;Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to hisoriginal point with a smile of unbelief. I’m not so sure about that. That’s amatter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side ofthe business, I beg to differ with you <i>in toto</i> there. My belief is, totell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of themput in by monks most probably or it’s the big question of our national poetover again, who precisely wrote them like <i>Hamlet</i> and Bacon, as, you whoknow your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn’t tell you.Can’t you drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it. And take a piece ofthat bun. It’s like one of our skipper’s bricks disguised. Still no-one cangive what he hasn’t got. Try a bit.</p><p>&mdash;Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the momentrefusing to dictate further.</p><p>Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir or tryto the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approachingacrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work. To besure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good,shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines forvagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings and useful lectures (admittancefree) by qualified men for the lower orders. On the other hand he had adistinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy whohad been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remunerationindeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, wasto do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of. Sulphateof copper poison SO<sub>4</sub> or something in some dried peas he rememberedreading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t remember when itwas or where. Anyhow inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables seemed tohim more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of DrTibble’s Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.</p><p>&mdash;Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after beingstirred.</p><p>Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from thebrown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip ofthe offending beverage.</p><p>&mdash;Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solidfood, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regularmeals as the <i>sine qua non</i> for any kind of proper work, mental or manual.You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.</p><p>&mdash;Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away thatknife. I can’t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.</p><p>Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, ablunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antiqueabout it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuouspoint about it.</p><p>&mdash;Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom <i>apropos</i> ofknives remarked to his <i>confidante sotto voce</i>. Do you think they aregenuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie likeold boots. Look at him.</p><p>Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of ahost of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite withinthe bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at firstblush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off hischest being strictly accurate gospel.</p><p>He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him andSherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though awellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, therewas something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery andit required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlookingspecimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He might even have done forhis man supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did aboutothers, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or fivegoodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (norelation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen ofour national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner abovedescribed. On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weaknessbecause meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waitingnews from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas todraw the long bow about the schooner <i>Hesperus</i> and etcetera. And when allwas said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t probably hold aproverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.</p><p>&mdash;Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed.Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants, though thatis rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the midget queen. In thosewaxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sittingbowlegged, they couldn’t straighten their legs if you paid them because themuscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the briefoutline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee,were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adoredas gods. There’s an example again of simple souls.</p><p>However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who remindedhim a bit of Ludwig, <i>alias</i> Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of theGaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the <i>FlyingDutchman</i>, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in largenumbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantomor the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains) therewas nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrarythat stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos thoughcandidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in thefish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in littleItaly there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows exceptperhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of thefeline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckinwith garlic <i>de rigueur</i> off him or her next day on the quiet and, headded, on the cheap.</p><p>&mdash;Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments likethat, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own handsand give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in theabdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. My wife is, so tospeak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could actually claim Spanishnationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, i.e.Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite dark, regular brunette, black. I forone certainly believe climate accounts for character. That’s why I asked you ifyou wrote your poetry in Italian.</p><p>&mdash;The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were verypassionate about ten shillings. <i>Roberto ruba roba sua</i>.</p><p>&mdash;Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.</p><p>&mdash;Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknownlistener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles trianglemiss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.</p><p>&mdash;It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the bloodof the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museumtoday, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it, and I was just lookingat those antique statues there. The splendid proportions of hips, bosom. Yousimply don’t knock against those kind of women here. An exception here andthere. Handsome yes, pretty in a way you find but what I’m talking about is thefemale form. Besides they have so little taste in dress, most of them, whichgreatly enhances a woman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpledstockings, it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a thing Isimply hate to see.</p><p>Interest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the othersgot on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions withicebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course had his own say to say. Hehad doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind,in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing,he declared, stood to him or words to that effect, a pious medal he had thatsaved him.</p><p>So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck of thatillfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment tillthe jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it<i>Palme</i> on Booterstown strand. That was the talk of the town that year(Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive meriton the topic for the Irish <i>Times</i>), breakers running over her and crowdsand crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror. Then someone saidsomething about the case of the s. s. <i>Lady Cairns</i> of Swansea run into bythe <i>Mona</i> which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather andlost with all hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the <i>Mona</i>’s,said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, itappears, in her hold.</p><p>At this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him tounfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.</p><p>&mdash;Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was justgently dropping off into a peaceful doze.</p><p>He made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, steppedheavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left. Whilehe was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood upthat he had two flasks of presumably ship’s rum sticking one out of each pocketfor the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottleand uncork it or unscrew and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good olddelectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, whoalso had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre afterthe counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared toall intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when dulyrefreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and girders ofthe Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically alteredsince his last visit and greatly improved. Some person or persons invisibledirected him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over theplace for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silencereigned supreme the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himselfcloser at hand, the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequentlysplashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. Ahoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightlydisturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of thecorporation stones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was noneother in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parishrates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability fromdictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his boxbefore composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus, a truly amazingpiece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectablyconnected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came infor a cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled assproceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. And there he was at the end ofhis tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without abeggarly stiver. He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more amoral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if&mdash;a bigif, however&mdash;he had contrived to cure himself of his particularpartiality.</p><p>All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwiseand foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing. APalgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin, the only launchthat year. Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.</p><p>There were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently <i>aufait</i>.</p><p>What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock inGalway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington orsome name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, he advised them, how muchpalmoil the British government gave him for that day’s work, Captain John Leverof the Lever Line.</p><p>&mdash;Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after hisprivate potation and the rest of his exertions.</p><p>That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled inwouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds orthirds. Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably(which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fistwhile he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour afterthe liquid fire in question. Anyhow in he rolled after his successfullibation-<i>cum</i>-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the<i>soirée</i>, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:</p><p class="poem">&mdash;The biscuits was as hard as brass<br/>And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse.<br/>O, Johnny Lever!<br/>Johnny Lever, O!</p><p>After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene andregaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided.Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airinghis grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources ofIreland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthydissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God’s earth, farand away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million poundsworth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs and allthe riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people thatpaid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and alot more surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly becamegeneral and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal thing inIrish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down there in Navangrowing tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But aday of reckoning, he stated <i>crescendo</i> with no uncertain voice,thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in store for mighty England,despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes. There would be a fall andthe greatest fall in history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have theirlittle lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. BrummagemEngland was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achillesheel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, theGreek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped theirattention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. His advice to everyIrishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live forIreland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.</p><p>Silence all round marked the termination of his <i>finale</i>. The imperviousnavigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.</p><p>&mdash;Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bitpeeved in response to the foregoing truism.</p><p>To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred butnevertheless held to his main view.</p><p>&mdash;Who’s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran iratelyinterrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals andgenerals we’ve got? Tell me that.</p><p>&mdash;The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facialblemishes apart.</p><p>&mdash;That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholicpeasant. He’s the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?</p><p>While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added hecared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy ofhis salt that served it. Then they began to have a few irascible words when itwaxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followedthe passage of arms with interest so long as they didn’t indulge inrecriminations and come to blows.</p><p>From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was ratherinclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending thatconsummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant ofthe fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much biggerfools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite.It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in ahundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played outand if, as time went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he couldpersonally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equallyrelevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in theinterim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart.Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put itin common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for Englandas against her, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pairof them, the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, thefamous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly asbeing on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it wasprearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything, theothers seeing least of the game. And as for the lessee or keeper, who probablywasn’t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn’t help feeling and most properlyit was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blitheringidiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rulein private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of aDannyman coming forward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like Denisor Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that hedisliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet, though suchcriminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape orform, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what hewas) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished aknife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions (though,personally, he would never be a party to any such thing), off the same bat asthose love vendettas of the south, have her or swing for her, when the husbandfrequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relationswith the other lucky mortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatalinjuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial<i>liaison</i> by plunging his knife into her, until it just struck him thatFitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetratorsof the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party tothe ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved hisskin on. In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for ourfriend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived hiswelcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. Likeactresses, always farewell positively last performance then come up smilingagain. Generous to a fault of course, temperamental, no economising or any ideaof the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow. So similarly he had avery shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £. s. d. in thecourse of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the<i>Old Ireland</i> tavern, come back to Erin and so on. Then as for the otherhe had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen howhe simply but effectually silenced the offender.</p><p>&mdash;He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the wholeeventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and in a heatedfashion offensively. So I without deviating from plain facts in the least toldhim his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his family like me though inreality I’m not. That was one for him. A soft answer turns away wrath. Hehadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone saw. Am I not right?</p><p>He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at thesoft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in akind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly.</p><p>&mdash;<i>Ex quibus</i>, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two orfour eyes conversing, <i>Christus</i> or Bloom his name is or after all anyother, <i>secundum carnem</i>.</p><p>&mdash;Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides ofthe question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right andwrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though everycountry, they say, our own distressful included, has the government itdeserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It’s all very fine to boast ofmutual superiority but what about mutual equality. I resent violence andintolerance in any shape or form. It never reaches anything or stops anything.A revolution must come on the due instalments plan. It’s a patent absurdity onthe face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speakanother vernacular, in the next house so to speak.</p><p>&mdash;Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen assented,between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market.</p><p>Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that wasoverwhelmingly right. And the whole world was full of that sort of thing.</p><p>&mdash;You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus ofconflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely...</p><p>All those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood, fromsome bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to beabout a punctilio of honour and a flag, were very largely a question of themoney question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, peoplenever knowing when to stop.</p><p>&mdash;They accuse, remarked he audibly. He turned away from the others, whoprobably… and spoke nearer to, so as the others… in case they…</p><p>&mdash;Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused ofruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History, would you besurprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisitionhounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly ableruffian who in other respects has much to answer for, imported them. Why?Because they are imbued with the proper spirit. They are practical and areproved to be so. I don’t want to indulge in any because you know the standardworks on the subject and then orthodox as you are. But in the economic, nottouching religion, domain the priest spells poverty. Spain again, you saw inthe war, compared with goahead America. Turks. It’s in the dogma. Because ifthey didn’t believe they’d go straight to heaven when they die they’d try tolive better, at least so I think. That’s the juggle on which the p.p.’s raisethe wind on false pretences. I’m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good anIrishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to seeeveryone, concluded he, all creeds and classes <i>pro rata</i> having acomfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in theneighbourhood of £ 300 per annum. That’s the vital issue at stake and it’sfeasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man andman. At least that’s my idea for what it’s worth. I call that patriotism.<i>Ubi patria</i>, as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in<i>Alma Mater, vita bene</i>. Where you can live well, the sense is, if youwork.</p><p>Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis ofthings in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular. He could hear, ofcourse, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend inthe morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the samesand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to. Then he looked upand saw the eyes that said or didn’t say the words the voice he heard said, ifyou work.</p><p>&mdash;Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.</p><p>The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person who ownedthem pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all must work, haveto, together.</p><p>&mdash;I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widestpossible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing.Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays. That’s worktoo. Important work. After all, from the little I know of you, after all themoney expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself andcommand your price. You have every bit as much right to live by your pen inpursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. What? You both belong toIreland, the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important.</p><p>&mdash;You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may beimportant because I belong to the <i>faubourg Saint Patrice</i> called Irelandfor short.</p><p>&mdash;I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.</p><p>&mdash;But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be importantbecause it belongs to me.</p><p>&mdash;What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps undersome misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the latterportion. What was it you...?</p><p>Stephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee orwhatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:</p><p>&mdash;We can’t change the country. Let us change the subject.</p><p>At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down butin a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction to put on belongsto which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some kind was clearer than theother part. Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with someasperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state. Probably thehomelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that wasneedful or he hadn’t been familiarised with the right sort of people. With atouch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised withan air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, theeyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing tothrow much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances ofcultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of prematuredecay and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance there was the case ofO’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist, respectably connected though ofinadequate means, with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rottoand making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit ofostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then theusual <i>dénouement</i> after the fun had gone on fast and furious he gotlanded into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after astrong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as notto be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act,certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasonswhich will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. Briefly, putting two and twotogether, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and soforth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in theseventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life theoccupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper tenand other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of thestate, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads runningcounter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before undertheir veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, asthe law stands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thoughtthey were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were alwaysfiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and allthe rest of it. Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and everywelltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendoand give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two, sheunbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in thecannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental.However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who hadforced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of theirbootstraps. Sheer force of natural genius, that. With brains, sir.</p><p>For which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even to waiton and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could not exactly tellbeing as it was already several shillings to the bad having in fact let himselfin for it. Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommoncalibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small.Intellectual stimulation, as such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstratetonic for the mind. Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion,dance, row, old salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers,the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the worldwe live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz. coalminers,divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope lately. To improvethe shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approachingthe same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing suppose he were topen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rateof one guinea per column. <i>My Experiences</i>, let us say, <i>in a Cabman’sShelter</i>.</p><p>The pink edition extra sporting of the <i>Telegraph</i> tell a graphic lie lay,as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling again, farfrom satisfied, over a country belonging to him and the preceding rebus thevessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard was addressed A.

Of coursegambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though as the event turnedout the poor fool hadn’t much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, theforlorn hope. Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.</p><p>&mdash;There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.</p><p>&mdash;Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.</p><p>One morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read: <i>Returnof Parnell</i>. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was in thatshelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it was killed him.He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after committeeroom no 15 until he was his old self again with no-one to point a finger athim. Then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him tocome back when he had recovered his senses. Dead he wasn’t. Simply abscondedsomewhere. The coffin they brought over was full of stones. He changed his nameto De Wet, the Boer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And soforth and so on.</p><p>All the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memoriesfor in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but intheir thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years.Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and,even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered.Something evidently riled them in his death. Either he petered out too tamelyof acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements werenearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his havingneglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resultedand failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till heeventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an endor quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of theirhands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before therewas absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the<i>Alice, where art thou</i> order even prior to his starting to go underseveral aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated fromfriend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility. Naturally then it wouldprey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and acommanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in hisstockinged feet, whereas Messrs So and So who, though they weren’t even a patchon the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very fewand far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay, andthen seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging.And the identical same with murderers. You had to come back. That hauntingsense kind of drew you. To show the understudy in the title <i>rôle</i> how to.He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the<i>Insuppressible</i> or was it <i>United Ireland</i>, a privilege he keenlyappreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knockedoff and he said <i>Thank you</i>, excited as he undoubtedly was under hisfrigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between thecup and the lip: what’s bred in the bone. Still as regards return. You were alucky dog if they didn’t set the terrier at you directly you got back. Then alot of shillyshally usually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against. Andthen, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produceyour credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger CharlesTichborne, <i>Bella</i> was the boat’s name to the best of his recollection he,the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo marktoo in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very easily have picked upthe details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with thedescription given, introduce himself with: <i>Excuse me, my name is So andSo</i> or some such commonplace remark. A more prudent course, as Bloom said tothe not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage underdiscussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.</p><p>&mdash;That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietorcommented. She put the first nail in his coffin.</p><p>&mdash;Fine lump of a woman all the same, the <i>soi-disant</i> townclerk HenryCampbell remarked, and plenty of her. She loosened many a man’s thighs. I seenher picture in a barber’s. The husband was a captain or an officer.</p><p>&mdash;Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.</p><p>This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amountof laughter among his <i>entourage</i>. As regards Bloom he, without thefaintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door andreflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest atthe time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usualaffectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings. First itwas strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang upbetween them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became thetalk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to nota few evildisposed, however, who were resolved upon encompassing his downfallthough the thing was public property all along though not to anything like thesensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. Since their names werecoupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particularnecessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact,namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oathwhen a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody inthe shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such aparticular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with theassistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the samefashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coinedshoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply acase of the husband not being up to the scratch, with nothing in common betweenthem beyond the name, and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to theverge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting hometies, the usual sequel, to bask in the loved one’s smiles. The eternal questionof the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. Can real love, supposingthere happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk?Poser. Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her withaffection, carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of manhoodhe was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as compared with theother military supernumerary that is (who was just the usual everyday<i>farewell, my gallant captain</i> kind of an individual in the lightdragoons, the 18<sup>th</sup> hussars to be accurate) and inflammable doubtless(the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which sheof course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to famewhich he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel asa whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents, and his beloved evicted tenants forwhom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking upthe cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguineexpectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heapingcoals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass’s kick.Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind ofdream. And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it wentwithout saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with thetimes. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he had not been infor quite a number of years looked different somehow since, as it happened, hewent to reside on the north side. North or south, however, it was just thewellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with avengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also wasSpanish or half so, types that wouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandonof the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.</p><p>&mdash;Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said toStephen, about blood and the sun. And, if I don’t greatly mistake she wasSpanish too.</p><p>&mdash;The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something orother rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and thefirst land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.</p><p>&mdash;Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any means,I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it was as shelived there. So, Spain.</p><p>Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket <i>Sweets of</i>, which reminded him bythe by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out hispocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finallyhe.</p><p>&mdash;Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a fadedphoto which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?</p><p>Stephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sizedlady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in thefull bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for theoccasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts,her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly withgravity, a piano on the rest of which was <i>In Old Madrid</i>, a ballad,pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her (the lady’s) eyes, dark,large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired,Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin’s premier photographic artist, beingresponsible for the esthetic execution.</p><p>&mdash;Mrs Bloom, my wife the <i>prima donna</i> Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloomindicated. Taken a few years since. In or about ninety six. Very like her then.</p><p>Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wifewho, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy anddisplayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even madeher bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen. As for theface it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to herfigure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out tothe best advantage in that getup. She could without difficulty, he said, haveposed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. Hedwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form ingeneral developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than thatafternoon he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works ofart, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original, shoulders, back,all the symmetry, all the rest. Yes, puritanisme, it does though, SaintJoseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop. Whereas no photocould because it simply wasn’t art in a word.</p><p>The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s goodexample and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itselfon the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, herstage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not atall do justice to. But it was scarcely professional etiquette so. Though it wasa warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the seasonconsidering, for sunshine after storm. And he did feel a kind of need there andthen to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need bymoving a motion. Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiledphoto creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and lookedaway thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’spossible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving <i>embonpoint</i>.In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linenslightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch out. Supposeshe was gone when he? I looked for the lamp which she told me came into hismind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected themorning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses(<i>sic</i>) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately besidethe domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.</p><p>The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, <i>distingué</i>and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch though youwouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would. Besides he said the picture washandsome which, say what you like, it was though at the moment she wasdistinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of makebelieve went on about thatsort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page ofgutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct withprofessional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest andaboveboard about the whole business. How they were fated to meet and anattachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in thepublic eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy andcompromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabitedtwo or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, whenthe thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. Then the decree<i>nisi</i> and the King’s proctor tries to show cause why and, he failing toquash it, <i>nisi</i> was made absolute. But as for that the two misdemeanants,wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignoreit as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitorwho filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. He, B, enjoyed thedistinction of being close to Erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thingoccurred on the historic <i>fracas</i> when the fallen leader’s, whonotoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantleof adultery, (leader’s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen orpossibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the<i>Insuppressible</i> or no it was <i>United Ireland</i> (a by no means by theby appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers orsomething like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facilepens of the O’Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflectingon the erstwhile tribune’s private morals. Though palpably a radically alteredman he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual withthat look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyerstill they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet ofclay after placing him upon a pedestal which she, however, was the first toperceive. As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloomsustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowdthat of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach,fortunately not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one wasinadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the manwho picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to returnit to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who pantingand hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all thesame being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he, as a matter offact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else,what’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee inthe shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turnedround to the donor and thanked him with perfect <i>aplomb</i>, saying: <i>Thankyou, sir</i>, though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of thelegal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the courseof the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial of amutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task ofhaving committed his remains to the grave.</p><p>On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of thecabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately,pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in realitynot knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselvesunless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owingto some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come acrossthem at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms,drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domesticrumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master uponher knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits anymore if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones bebygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her faircheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others. Hepersonally, being of a sceptical bias, believed and didn’t make the smallestbones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hangingaround on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wifein the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument,when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was onfor a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her withimproper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, thecause of many <i>liaisons</i> between still attractive married women getting onfor fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases offeminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.</p><p>It was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of brains ashis neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligatewomen who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime. In thenature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife whenMiss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies’ society was a<i>conditio sine qua non</i> though he had the gravest possible doubts, notthat he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who wasvery possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown soearly in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking inthe boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without apenny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter ofcomplimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowersand chocs. To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worsethan any stepmother, was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly thingshe popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other’ssenior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eateven were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or,failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.</p><p>&mdash;At what o’clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tiredthough unwrinkled face.</p><p>&mdash;Some time yesterday, Stephen said.</p><p>&mdash;Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrowFriday. Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!</p><p>&mdash;The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.</p><p>Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected. Though theydidn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as ifboth their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought. Athis age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously whenhe had been a <i>quasi</i> aspirant to parliamentary honours in the BuckshotFoster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keensatisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas.For instance when the evicted tenants question, then at its first inception,bulked largely in people’s mind though, it goes without saying, notcontributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some ofwhich wouldn’t exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all eventswas in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modernopinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he wassubsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a step fartherthan Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as abacktothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo putupon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clansin Barney Kiernan’s so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and theleast pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habitto give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politicsthemselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualtiesinvariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and themisery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine youngfellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.</p><p>Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it was, itwas high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit risky tobring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temperof her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night hemisguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw (not that thecases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too) toOntario Terrace as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so tospeak. On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for theSandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as towhich of the two alternatives. Everything pointed to the fact that it behovedhim to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. Hisinitial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but itgrew on him someway. For one thing he mightn’t what you call jump at the idea,if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn’t know how to lead up toit or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it wouldafford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to putcoin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound upby concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps’scocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoatdoubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toaston a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that alwayswith the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. A move had to be madebecause that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question who appeared to beglued to the spot, didn’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way hometo his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger’sbawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lowerwould be the best clue to that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few daysto come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids’) with sixchamberrevolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow ofanybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with roughand tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and theusual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal myright name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks <i>passim</i>. At the same timehe inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns championabout his god being a jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf butwhat properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point tooof tender Achilles. Your god was a jew. Because mostly they appeared to imaginehe came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.</p><p>&mdash;I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection whileprudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come homewith me and talk things over.

I’ll just pay this lot.</p><p>The best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, hebeckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty whodidn’t seem to.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of thatBrazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.</p><p>All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B’s) busy brain,education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up todate billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed with hydros andseaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accentperfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity, ofcourse, to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it, and a sliceof luck. An opening was all was wanted. Because he more than suspected he hadhis father’s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he hadso it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation inthe direction of that particular red herring just to.</p><p>The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy,earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers’ association dinner in Londonsomewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement.Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitalityleft read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chiefsecretary’s lodge or words to that effect. To which absorbing piece ofintelligence echo answered why.</p><p>&mdash;Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient marinerput in, manifesting some natural impatience.</p><p>&mdash;And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.</p><p>The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which hevery slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.</p><p>&mdash;Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerkqueried.</p><p>&mdash;Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was abit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen portholesas you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading. Sand in the Red Seadone that. One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking. <i>TheArabian Nights Entertainment</i> was my favourite and <i>Red as a Rose isShe.</i></p><p>Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, founddrowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred andsomething second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completelyregardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparentlynew or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered againstwhoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to bepicked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply lookingon glumly or passing a trivial remark.</p><p>To cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to risefrom his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost,being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, takenthe wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot ascarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect thatthe amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amounthe deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of theMohicans), he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all whoran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do,and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used toremark.</p><p>&mdash;Come, he counselled to close the <i>séance</i>.</p><p>Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter orshanty together and the <i>élite</i> society of oilskin and company whomnothing short of an earthquake would move out of their <i>dolce far niente</i>.Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the,for a moment, the door.</p><p>&mdash;One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of themoment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down, onthe tables in cafés. To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied withouta moment’s hesitation, saying straight off:</p><p>&mdash;To sweep the floor in the morning.</p><p>So saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same timeapologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the bye, hisright side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The night air wascertainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.</p><p>&mdash;It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in amoment. The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man. Come. It’snot far. Lean on me.</p><p>Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him onaccordingly.</p><p>&mdash;Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kindof flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.</p><p>Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where the municipalsupernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in thearms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new.And <i>apropos</i> of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it wasin fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty oddconstituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belaudedpeasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in theirholdings.</p><p>So they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as apure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm in armacross Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way,was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but themusic of Mercadante’s <i>Huguenots</i>, Meyerbeer’s <i>Seven Last Words on theCross</i> and Mozart’s <i>Twelfth Mass</i> he simply revelled in, the<i>Gloria</i> in that being, to his mind, the acme of first class music assuch, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. He infinitelypreferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shopcould offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or <i>Bid me tolive and I will live thy protestant to be</i>. He also yielded to none in hisadmiration of Rossini’s <i>Stabat Mater</i>, a work simply abounding inimmortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, averitable sensation, he might safely say, greatly adding to her other laurelsand putting the others totally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church inupper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hearher with virtuosos, or <i>virtuosi</i> rather. There was the unanimous opinionthat there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place ofworship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire foran encore. On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the <i>DonGiovanni</i> description and <i>Martha</i>, a gem in its line, he had a<i>penchant</i>, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classicalschool such as Mendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it for granted he knewall about the old favourites, he mentioned <i>par excellence</i> Lionel’s airin <i>Martha, M’appari</i>, which, curiously enough, he had heard or overheard,to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from thelips of Stephen’s respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number,in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to apolitely put query, said he didn’t sing it but launched out into praises ofShakespeare’s songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowlandwho lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who <i>anno ludendo hausi,Doulandus</i>, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr ArnoldDolmetsch, whom B. did not quite recall though the name certainly soundedfamiliar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their <i>dux</i> and<i>comes</i> conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals, he said, inthe Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toysor airs and John Bull.</p><p>On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond theswingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing along swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certainwhether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull.He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as itstruck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.</p><p>By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom, whowas keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s sleeve gently,jocosely remarking:</p><p>&mdash;Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.</p><p>They thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anythinglike sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that itseemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably itwas a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhangerputting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on theperch, busy with his thoughts. But such a good poor brute he was sorry hehadn’t a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely beprepared for every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big nervousfoolish noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. But even adog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the same size,would be a holy horror to face. But it was no animal’s fault in particular ifhe was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapesinto potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained,nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. Whale with a harpoon hairpin,alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke, chalk a circle fora rooster, tiger my eagle eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes of thefield occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen’s words while the shipof the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interestingold.</p><p>&mdash;What’s this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging <i>inmedias res</i>, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintanceas she is passionately attached to music of any kind.</p><p>He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image ofhis mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard typethey unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps notthat way built.</p><p>Still, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected, it openedup new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish industries, concert onthe preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.</p><p>Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air <i>Youth here has End</i>by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from.Even more he liked an old German song of <i>Johannes Jeep</i> about the clearsea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom abit:</p><p class="poem">Von der Sirenen Listigkeit<br/>Tun die Poeten dichten.</p><p>These opening bars he sang and translated <i>extempore</i>. Bloom, nodding,said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did.</p><p>A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, whichBloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properlyhandled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barracloughand being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price wherebaritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the nearfuture an <i>entrée</i> into fashionable houses in the best residentialquarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled peoplewhere with his university degree of B. A. (a huge ad in its way) andgentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he wouldinfallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also couldbe utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properlyattended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, ayouthful tyro in society’s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a littlething like that could militate against you. It was in fact only a matter ofmonths and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical andartistic <i>conversaziones</i> during the festivities of the Christmas season,for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and beingmade a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened toknow, were on record&mdash;in fact, without giving the show away, he himselfonce upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. Added to which of coursewould be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand inhand with his tuition fees. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthylucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for anylengthy space of time. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yeaor nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on hisdignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed acheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though tastelatterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different fromthe conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decidednovelty for Dublin’s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchytenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Justand their <i>genus omne</i>. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with allthe cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himselfand win a high place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figureand, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King streethouse, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so tospeak, a big <i>if</i>, however, with some impetus of the goahead sort toobviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêtedprince of good fellows. And it need not detract from the other by one iota as,being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in hisspare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocalcareer or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter forhimself alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the veryreason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a ratof any sort, hung on to him at all.</p><p>The horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed(Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the <i>foolsstep in where angels</i> principle, advising him to sever his connection with acertain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and evento a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him,or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nastysidelight on that side of a person’s character, no pun intended.</p><p>The horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and,rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on thefloor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes ofturds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired. Andhumanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythedcar.</p><p>Side by side Bloom, profiting by the <i>contretemps</i>, with Stephen passedthrough the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over astrand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing moreboldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.</p><p class="poem">Und alle Schiffe brücken.</p><p>The driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely watched thetwo figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean,walk towards the railway bridge, <i>to be married by Father Maher</i>. As theywalked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their <i>tête àtête</i> (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens, enemies ofman’s reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category,usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or youmight as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn’t possibly hearbecause they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardinerstreet <i>and looked after their lowbacked car</i>.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="chap17"></a>[ 17 ]</h3><p>What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?</p><p>Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followedin the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west:then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner’s place by an inadvertenceas far as the farther corner of Temple street: then, at reduced pace withinterruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwickeplace. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both thecircus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being lessthan the arc which it subtends.</p><p>Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?</p><p>Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution,diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growthof adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets,the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuiteducation, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficentinfluence of the presabbath, Stephen’s collapse.</p><p>Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective likeand unlike reactions to experience?</p><p>Both were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to plasticor pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, acisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by earlydomestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professedtheir disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethicaldoctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence ofheterosexual magnetism.</p><p>Were their views on some points divergent?</p><p>Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of dietary andcivic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s views on theeternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assented covertlyto Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date ofthe conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick sonof Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in theyear 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign ofCormac MacArt († 266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment atSletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastricinanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration andalcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapidcircular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to thereapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different pointsof observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman’s hand.</p><p>Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?</p><p>The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoiningparaheliotropic trees.</p><p>Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in thepast?</p><p>In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfaresbetween Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and Leonard’s corner and Syngestreet and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue.

In 1886 occasionally with casualacquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, inthird class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with majorBrian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately onthe lounge in Matthew Dillon’s house in Roundtown.

Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the arearailings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower unionof rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nineinches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement andallowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from therailings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.</p><p>Did he fall?</p><p>By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupoismeasure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing inthe premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederickstreet, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day ofMay of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the christianera (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era onethousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle9, dominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.</p><p>Did he rise uninjured by concussion?</p><p>Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by theimpact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at itsfreely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum,gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, igniteda lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on theventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescentcandescence and lit finally a portable candle.</p><p>What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?</p><p>Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchenpanes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a candle of 1 CP, aman removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding acandle.</p><p>Did the man reappear elsewhere?</p><p>After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible throughthe semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor.

In the open space of the doorway the manreappeared without his hat, with his candle.</p><p>Did Stephen obey his sign?</p><p>Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softlyalong the hallway the man’s back and listed feet and lighted candle past alighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircaseof more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom’s house.</p><p>What did Bloom do?</p><p>He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drewtwo spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back tothe area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee,composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and variouscoloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyoneshillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M’Donald of 14 D’Olierstreet, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifermatch, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowingits carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen ofthe air.</p><p>Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?</p><p>Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, hadkindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college ofthe Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: ofhis father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence inDublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan inthe house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher’s Island: of hisaunt Sara, wife of Richie (Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgingsat 62 Clanbrassil street: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in thekitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast ofSaint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics’theatre of university College, 16 Stephen’s Green, north: of his sister Dilly(Delia) in his father’s house in Cabra.</p><p>What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the firetowards the opposite wall?</p><p>Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretchedbetween two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, fromwhich hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutivelyin adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies’ grey hose with Lisle suspendertops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs twoat their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.</p><p>What did Bloom see on the range?</p><p>On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hoba black iron kettle.</p><p>What did Bloom do at the range?</p><p>He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle tothe sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.</p><p>Did it flow?</p><p>Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2400million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains ofsingle and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of £ 5 perlinear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill tothe 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, andthence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to thecity boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolongedsummer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallenbelow the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor andwaterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C. E., on the instructions of thewaterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposesother than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse beinghad to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893)particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convictedof a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on theaffirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor,thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public,selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.</p><p>What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returningto the range, admire?</p><p>Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature inseeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator’s projection: itsunplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8000fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turnall points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability ofstates of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidityin neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility inthe circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercialsignificance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: itsindisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below thesubequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primevalbasin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution allsoluble substances including millions of tons of the most precious metals: itsslow erosions of peninsulas and islands, its persistent formation of homotheticislands, peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits:its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highlandtarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones:its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluentoceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents,gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes,waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates,groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools,maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrialahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and latent humidity, revealed byrhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the well by the holein the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: thesimplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with oneconstituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters ofthe Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequatedams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst andfire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: itsmetamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength inrigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bightsand guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords andminches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers,icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines,dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: itsutility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: itspotentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from levelto level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically,if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes,pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.</p><p>Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return tothe stillflowing tap?</p><p>To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington’slemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought thirteen hourspreviously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchangingeverchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered hollandcloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.</p><p>What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom’s offer?</p><p>That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total bysubmersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month ofOctober of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass andcrystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.</p><p>What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic towhich should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the headand contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck andthoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts ofthe human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar orsole of foot?</p><p>The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.</p><p>What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?</p><p>Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy inbacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and theabundance of the latter in the firstnamed.</p><p>Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?</p><p>Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment andrecuperation.</p><p>What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency offire?</p><p>The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilationbetween the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from thefaggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal,containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua ofprimeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from thesun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresentluminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developedby such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source ofcalorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated throughthe uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, inpart absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of thewater from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as theresult of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise 1 pound of waterfrom 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.</p><p>What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?</p><p>A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at bothsides simultaneously.</p><p>For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?</p><p>To shave himself.</p><p>What advantages attended shaving by night?</p><p>A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave toshave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encounteringfemale acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflectionsupon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a freshersleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clatteredmilkcan, a postman’s double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering,relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he soughtthough fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick onwhich incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered:which was to be done.</p><p>Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?</p><p>Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine femininepassive active hand.</p><p>What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?</p><p>The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human bloodeven when the end justified the means, preferring, in their natural order,heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.</p><p>What lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the kitchendresser, opened by Bloom?</p><p>On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfastsaucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted,and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy pursedisplaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits.

In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially inthe ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasingand the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added,for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving thatto be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom,being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassedby 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years,while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in theyear 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years,having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C.</p><p>What events might nullify these calculations?</p><p>The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era orcalendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of thehuman species, inevitable but impredictable.</p><p>How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?</p><p>Two.

Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen wouldhave passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and seniorgrades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, secondarts and arts degree courses of the royal university.</p><p>Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university oflife?</p><p>Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had orhad not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.</p><p>What two temperaments did they individually represent?</p><p>The scientific. The artistic.</p><p>What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied,rather than towards pure, science?</p><p>Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a stateof supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of theimportance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, theaeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, thesafety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, thesuction pump.</p><p>Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme ofkindergarten?</p><p>Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelveconstellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanicalorreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond withzoological biscuits, globemap playing balls, historically costumed dolls.</p><p>What also stimulated him in his cogitations?</p><p>The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A.

splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.</p><p>What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen’s, gaze?</p><p>In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom’s) house the light of a paraffin oillamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by FrankO’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16Aungier street.</p><p>How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his wifeMarion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?</p><p>With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subduedaffection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.</p><p>Both then were silent?</p><p>Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh oftheirhisnothis fellowfaces.</p><p>Were they indefinitely inactive?</p><p>At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen, thenBloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs ofmicturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, theirgazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to the projected luminous andsemiluminous shadow.</p><p>Similarly?</p><p>The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations weredissimilar: Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of thebifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate year at HighSchool (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitudeagainst the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars:Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous dayhad augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.</p><p>What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisibleaudible collateral organ of the other?</p><p>To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity,dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.</p><p>To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessaryservile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnalbridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata,were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accordedto the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.</p><p>What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?</p><p>A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vegain the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenicetowards the zodiacal sign of Leo.</p><p>How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?</p><p>By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstablefemale lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wardsfrom right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inwardspasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for freeegress and free ingress.</p><p>How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?</p><p>Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, thelines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angleless than the sum of two right angles.</p><p>What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their(respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?</p><p>The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in thechurch of Saint George.</p><p>What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?</p><p>By Stephen:</p><p class="poem">Liliata rutilantium.

Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel(pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordiaehospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).</p><p>What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?</p><p>The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the apparitionof a new solar disk.</p><p>Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?</p><p>Once, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house of LukeDoyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnalphenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, theeast.</p><p>He remembered the initial paraphenomena?</p><p>More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at variouspoints, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visiblediffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb ofthe resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.</p><p>Did he remain?</p><p>With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering thepassage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle,reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, andreentered.</p><p>What suddenly arrested his ingress?</p><p>The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contactwith a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of asecond later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedentsensations transmitted and registered.</p><p>Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles offurniture.</p><p>A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the doorto the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which hehad frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaidmajolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated bythe prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which hadmomentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside thedoor to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door:two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the positionoriginally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.</p><p>Describe them.</p><p>One: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back slanted tothe rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of arectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centraliseddiffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chairof glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from topto seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being abright circle of white plaited rush.</p><p>What significances attached to these two chairs?</p><p>Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantialevidence, of testimonial supermanence.</p><p>What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?</p><p>A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting apair of long yellow ladies’ gloves and an emerald ashtray containing fourconsumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends ofcigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural forvoice and piano of <i>Love’s Old Sweet Song</i> (words by G.

Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the lastpage with the final indications <i>ad libitum, forte</i>, pedal,<i>animato</i>, sustained pedal, <i>ritirando</i>, close.</p><p>With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?</p><p>With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple acontused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on a large dull passiveand a slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning theupturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme ofcolour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the wordsand antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internalsensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradualdiscolouration.</p><p>His next proceeding?</p><p>From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutivecone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate,placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced fromhis waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled AgendathNetaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thincylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex ofthe cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder inthe basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner asto facilitate total combustion.</p><p>What followed this operation?</p><p>The truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted avertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.</p><p>What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?</p><p>A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m. onthe 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacialarborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke andCaroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper.</p><p>What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?</p><p>In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarftree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl.

He unbuttoned successively inreversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line ofirregular incrispated black hairs extending in triangular convergence from thepelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossiclealong the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoralvertebrae, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circlesdescribed about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of themammary prominences.

He scratched impreciselywith his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points andsurfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left handinto the left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silvercoin (1 shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903)of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.</p><p>Compile the budget for 16 June 1904.</p><pre xml:space="preserve">     <i>Debit</i>                                        £. s. d.     1 Pork kidney                      0&mdash;0&mdash;3     1 Copy <i>Freeman’s Journal</i>           0&mdash;0&mdash;1     1 Bath and Gratification           0&mdash;1&mdash;6     Tramfare                           0&mdash;0&mdash;1     1 In Memoriam Patrick Dignam       0&mdash;5&mdash;0     2 Banbury cakes                    0&mdash;0&mdash;1     1 Lunch                            0&mdash;0&mdash;7     1 Renewal fee for book             0&mdash;1&mdash;0     1 Packet Notepaper and Envelopes   0&mdash;0&mdash;2     1 Dinner and Gratification         0&mdash;2&mdash;0     1 Postal Order and Stamp           0&mdash;2&mdash;8     Tramfare                           0&mdash;0&mdash;1     1 Pig’s Foot                       0&mdash;0&mdash;4     1 Sheep’s Trotter                  0&mdash;0&mdash;3     1 Cake Fry’s Plain Chocolate       0&mdash;0&mdash;1     1 Square Soda Bread                0&mdash;0&mdash;4     1 Coffee and Bun                   0&mdash;0&mdash;4     Loan (Stephen Dedalus) refunded    1&mdash;7&mdash;0        BALANCE                         0&mdash;16&mdash;6                                        &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;                                        2&mdash;19&mdash;3</pre><pre xml:space="preserve">     <i>Credit</i>                                        £. s. d.

he used tobe pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to makehimself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had agreat leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself andher soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out 4d for hermethylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in herabout politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit offun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down onbathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I supposeshe was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be likeher a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducatedwoman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there Isuppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and alwaysedging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in himpolite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out ofnothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter withhim its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is cleanbut I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have ahospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throwhim out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Imnot yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman toget well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglookingone off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at thesugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowersthe worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at allto get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he wasdying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more likea man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hatebandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraidhed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see whatattention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they doyes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be offhis feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it wasdown there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hideit planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Mentonand who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not longmarried flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back onhim when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had theimpudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and hisboiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor onlyfor I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some littlebitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they onlyknew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribblingsomething a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death inthe paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaperpretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it tosomebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like thatat his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any moneyshe can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing mybottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with orknew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the twoof them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontarioterrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smellof those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting himto come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when Iwent into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enoughfor them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing thatshe could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not inmy house stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see heraunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something onwith that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have noproof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told herwhat I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldntlower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she wasout that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on herwith temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do withoutthem altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking andthrowing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the houseI couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar andsloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place inthe W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldntpossibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last timehe came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeezegoing along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed theback of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moonshes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a foolhe said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give himthe satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be alwaysand ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do itsince I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a littlealone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make himturn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down ontheir cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question andanswer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishopyes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside mein the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a strangerto Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me outwith statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mindnow tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me whothe german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel himtrying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now atthis age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in itpretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and itmakes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk ofthe world about it people make its only the first time after that its just theordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without goingand marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way sonice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take mesometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss longand hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession whenI used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he didwhere and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your personmy child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where yousit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it whathas that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget nofather and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for whenI already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always Iwouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in hishorsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldntsee mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when hisfather died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man crieslet alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell ofincense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youremarried hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for apenance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slappingme behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horseor an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awakethinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said hebought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweetykind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip thoserichlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drinkwith the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that Americanthat had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keephimself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port andpotted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tiredmyself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bedtill that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens werecoming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Marylike those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an endand then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it wasrunning and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle Ilit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see itbrought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to churchmass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matterbecause he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp becausehe must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing hehas I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burstthough his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blindsdown after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or somekind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters Ithink a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life feltanyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten awhole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in themiddle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all theywant out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshutmy eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made himpull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in caseany of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in menice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but ifsomeone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through withMilly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband giveus a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once ayear as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the onethey called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on itJesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of themfalling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to behealthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dontknow what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he wasmarried Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has morespunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powelland the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can thinkwhat he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bitwhen I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night ofGeorgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it wason account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had thestandup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord beinga carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive abouteverything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he wasgone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much Icouldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especiallyabout the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what wehave inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talkingwhen the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolnesson with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side wheneverhe asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me thepresent of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that Icould quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposinghe got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if herefused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collarof my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out 1 kiss thenwould send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to hershe of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with himthat I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him andlook her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was andmake a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to methough I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him forthat it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was onthe pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato caketheres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I wasin a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let outtoo much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him knowmore than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever hewas there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed upand down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women arealways egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by hissly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out withsomething the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because hewas very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I likedthough he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engagedafterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughingwith the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one afteranother with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yesbecause it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tellher a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make hermouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after wewere married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dottyhusband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the lasttime I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw onthe moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talkabout him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he usedto go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imaginehaving to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any momentwhat a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever hedoes always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and alwaysblacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up inthe street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £10000 for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simplybore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off nowwhat could you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than marryanother of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put upwith him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too atthe bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband forwhat I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt shethe downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can bedreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the worldwhat do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yesbecause they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea offflypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say itsfrom the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly inlove with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt careif that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to goand hang a woman surely are they</p><p>theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed atonce even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughingand trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered 2 teas and plainbread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when Istood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out ofme and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to letthem down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other weeksuch a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I nevergot after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish timeslost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloomand I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was lookingwhen I looked back and I went there for tea 2 days after in the hope but hewasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were inthe other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my handis nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a niceaquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot somuch still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchupof a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mulland the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying onthe hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hedlike me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes notnatural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give 9 pointsin 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forgetwhat he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with thecurly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face beforesomewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time BartellDArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choirstairs after I sang Gounods <i>Ave Maria</i> what are we waiting for O my heartkiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hotfor all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you canbelieve him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt itterrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terribleabout it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Illtake him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you arelike it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt anidea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me socheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him atiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth squarehe kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking mequestions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keepit as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket ofcourse hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezingat those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up totheir navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete thatone in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see everyatom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw himbefore he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road witha new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off hiscomplexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing therewhere hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything atall with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to knowwhere were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking afterme his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it wasgetting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to sayyes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeveswere too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear medrawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair offmy doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket <i>O Maria Santisima</i> he didlook a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made mehungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I hadon with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in thewet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you neverknow what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone waspassing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I usedto Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it wastoo public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like ajelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure outof it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I leftmy purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then hewrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face toany woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we metasking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt hehad a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking ortearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what itmeant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said andwasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture ofa womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere onlyfor children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimestwice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a womanwhen he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote thenight he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makesyou feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well likeGardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hatepeople who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables thenits somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchenblows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombardstreet and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stewdont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but

get regular pay or a bank where theycould put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course heprefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whatsyour programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smellof a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he couldhave been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try andpatch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me agreat mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really andtruly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that Ilost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming intofashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by thefinish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Leesit was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those richshops get on your nerves nothing kills

marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veinsand things curious the way its made 2 the same in case of twins theyre supposedto represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one ofthem pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of coursecompared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thinghanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder theyhide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meatmarket or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statueof the

as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefitthere isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especiallynow with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learnto take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her toSkerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school onlyhed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why hedid it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turnround with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me

be real loveif a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are afew men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it reallyhappened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in theirnatures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that wouldfeel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his fathermust have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor oldman I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few oldrags I have wanting to put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skinon her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restlessknowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I wastoo but theres no

that was all thinking of him and his mad crazyletters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everythingunderlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for eversomething he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself 4and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I amquite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only naturalweakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met whenI was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about 10minutes

to stand for amember of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather abouthome rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of theHuguenots to sing in French to

down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man withthe habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how canhe without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all myteeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me toshow one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinaforelying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was abigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asiaimitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to

and he thinks fatherbought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girlbecause I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as everafter 16 years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontarioterrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling everytime were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to
