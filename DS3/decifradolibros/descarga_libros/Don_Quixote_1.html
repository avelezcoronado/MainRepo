W. Clark, illustrated by Gustave Doré. Clark in hisedition states that, &ldquo;The English text of &lsquo;Don Quixote&rsquo; adopted in thisedition is that of Jarvis, with occasional corrections from Motteaux.&rdquo;See in the introduction below John Ormsby&rsquo;s critique of both the Jarvisand Motteaux translations. It has been elected in the present ProjectGutenberg edition to attach the famous engravings of Gustave Doré to theOrmsby translation instead of the Jarvis/Motteaux. The detail of many ofthe Doré engravings can be fully appreciated only by utilizing the &ldquo;FullSize&rdquo; button to expand them to their original dimensions. Ormsby in hisPreface has criticized the fanciful nature of Doré&rsquo;s illustrations;others feel these woodcuts and steel engravings well match Quixote&rsquo;sdreams. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.W.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p003.jpg (307K)" src="images/p003.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/p003.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a></p><div class="chapter"><h2>CONTENTS VOLUME I</h2><table summary="" style=""><tr><td> <a href="#pref01">INTRODUCTION</a><br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td> <a href="#pref02">PREFARATORY</a><br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td> <a href="#pref03">CERVANTES</a><br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td> <a href="#pref04">&lsquo;DON QUIXOTE&rsquo;</a><br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td> <a href="#pref05">THE AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</a><br/><br/></td></tr><tr><td> <a href="#pref06">COMMENDATORY VERSES</a><br/><br/></td></tr></table><hr /><table summary="" style=""><tr><td> <a href="#ch1">CHAPTER I.

There are some&mdash;and I confess myself to be one&mdash;for whomShelton&rsquo;s racy old version, with all its defects, has a charm that nomodern translation, however skilful or correct, could possess. Shelton hadthe inestimable advantage of belonging to the same generation asCervantes; &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; had to him a vitality that only a contemporarycould feel; it cost him no dramatic effort to see things as Cervantes sawthem; there is no anachronism in his language; he put the Spanish ofCervantes into the English of Shakespeare. Shakespeare himself most likelyknew the book; he may have carried it home with him in his saddle-bags toStratford on one of his last journeys, and under the mulberry tree at NewPlace joined hands with a kindred genius in its pages.</p><p>But it was soon made plain to me that to hope for even a moderatepopularity for Shelton was vain. His fine old crusted English would, nodoubt, be relished by a minority, but it would be only by a minority. Hiswarmest admirers must admit that he is not a satisfactory representativeof Cervantes. His translation of the First Part was very hastily made andwas never revised by him. It has all the freshness and vigour, but also afull measure of the faults, of a hasty production. It is often veryliteral&mdash;barbarously literal frequently&mdash;but just as often veryloose. He had evidently a good colloquial knowledge of Spanish, butapparently not much more. It never seems to occur to him that the sametranslation of a word will not suit in every case.</p><p>It is often said that we have no satisfactory translation of &ldquo;DonQuixote.&rdquo; To those who are familiar with the original, it savours oftruism or platitude to say so, for in truth there can be no thoroughlysatisfactory translation of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; into English or any otherlanguage. It is not that the Spanish idioms are so utterly unmanageable,or that the untranslatable words, numerous enough no doubt, are sosuperabundant, but rather that the sententious terseness to which thehumour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to Spanish, and can atbest be only distantly imitated in any other tongue.</p><p>The history of our English translations of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; is instructive.Shelton&rsquo;s, the first in any language, was made, apparently, about 1608,but not published till 1612. This of course was only the First Part. Ithas been asserted that the Second, published in 1620, is not the work ofShelton, but there is nothing to support the assertion save the fact thatit has less spirit, less of what we generally understand by &ldquo;go,&rdquo; about itthan the first, which would be only natural if the first were the work ofa young man writing <i>currente calamo</i>, and the second that of a middle-agedman writing for a bookseller. On the other hand, it is closer and moreliteral, the style is the same, the very same translations, ormistranslations, occur in it, and it is extremely unlikely that a newtranslator would, by suppressing his name, have allowed Shelton to carryoff the credit.</p><p>In 1687 John Phillips, Milton&rsquo;s nephew, produced a &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; &ldquo;madeEnglish,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;according to the humour of our modern language.&rdquo; His&ldquo;Quixote&rdquo; is not so much a translation as a travesty, and a travesty thatfor coarseness, vulgarity, and buffoonery is almost unexampled even in theliterature of that day.</p><p>Ned Ward&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life and Notable Adventures of Don Quixote, merrily translatedinto Hudibrastic Verse&rdquo; (1700), can scarcely be reckoned a translation,but it serves to show the light in which &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; was regarded at thetime.</p><p>A further illustration may be found in the version published in 1712 byPeter Motteux, who had then recently combined tea-dealing with literature.It is described as &ldquo;translated from the original by several hands,&rdquo; but ifso all Spanish flavour has entirely evaporated under the manipulation ofthe several hands. The flavour that it has, on the other hand, isdistinctly Franco-cockney. Anyone who compares it carefully with theoriginal will have little doubt that it is a concoction from Shelton andthe French of Filleau de Saint Martin, eked out by borrowings fromPhillips, whose mode of treatment it adopts. It is, to be sure, moredecent and decorous, but it treats &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; in the same fashion as acomic book that cannot be made too comic.</p><p>To attempt to improve the humour of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; by an infusion ofcockney flippancy and facetiousness, as Motteux&rsquo;s operators did, is notmerely an impertinence like larding a sirloin of prize beef, but anabsolute falsification of the spirit of the book, and it is a proof of theuncritical way in which &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; is generally read that this worsethan worthless translation&mdash;worthless as failing to represent, worsethan worthless as misrepresenting&mdash;should have been favoured as ithas been.</p><p>It had the effect, however, of bringing out a translation undertaken andexecuted in a very different spirit, that of Charles Jervas, the portraitpainter, and friend of Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, and Gay. Jervas has beenallowed little credit for his work, indeed it may be said none, for it isknown to the world in general as Jarvis&rsquo;s. It was not published untilafter his death, and the printers gave the name according to the currentpronunciation of the day. It has been the most freely used and the mostfreely abused of all the translations. It has seen far more editions thanany other, it is admitted on all hands to be by far the most faithful, andyet nobody seems to have a good word to say for it or for its author.Jervas no doubt prejudiced readers against himself in his preface, whereamong many true words about Shelton, Stevens, and Motteux, he rashly andunjustly charges Shelton with having translated not from the Spanish, butfrom the Italian version of Franciosini, which did not appear until tenyears after Shelton&rsquo;s first volume. A suspicion of incompetence, too,seems to have attached to him because he was by profession a painter and amediocre one (though he has given us the best portrait we have of Swift),and this may have been strengthened by Pope&rsquo;s remark that he &ldquo;translated&lsquo;Don Quixote&rsquo; without understanding Spanish.&rdquo; He has been also chargedwith borrowing from Shelton, whom he disparaged. It is true that in a fewdifficult or obscure passages he has followed Shelton, and gone astraywith him; but for one case of this sort, there are fifty where he is rightand Shelton wrong. As for Pope&rsquo;s dictum, anyone who examines Jervas&rsquo;sversion carefully, side by side with the original, will see that he was asound Spanish scholar, incomparably a better one than Shelton, exceptperhaps in mere colloquial Spanish. He was, in fact, an honest, faithful,and painstaking translator, and he has left a version which, whatever itsshortcomings may be, is singularly free from errors and mistranslations.</p><p>The charge against it is that it is stiff, dry&mdash;&ldquo;wooden&rdquo; in a word,&mdash;andno one can deny that there is a foundation for it. But it may be pleadedfor Jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrence ofthe light, flippant, jocose style of his predecessors. He was one of thefew, very few, translators that have shown any apprehension of theunsmiling gravity which is the essence of Quixotic humour; it seemed tohim a crime to bring Cervantes forward smirking and grinning at his owngood things, and to this may be attributed in a great measure the asceticabstinence from everything savouring of liveliness which is thecharacteristic of his translation. In most modern editions, it should beobserved, his style has been smoothed and smartened, but without anyreference to the original Spanish, so that if he has been made to readmore agreeably he has also been robbed of his chief merit of fidelity.</p><p>Smollett&rsquo;s version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one ofthese. At any rate it is plain that in its construction Jervas&rsquo;stranslation was very freely drawn upon, and very little or probably noheed given to the original Spanish.</p><p>The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly&rsquo;s,which appeared in 1769, &ldquo;printed for the Translator,&rdquo; was an impudentimposture, being nothing more than Motteux&rsquo;s version with a few of thewords, here and there, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot&rsquo;s (1774) wasonly an abridgment like Florian&rsquo;s, but not so skilfully executed; and theversion published by Miss Smirke in 1818, to accompany her brother&rsquo;splates, was merely a patchwork production made out of former translations.On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield&rsquo;s, it would be in every sense of theword impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not even seen itwhen the present undertaking was proposed to me, and since then I may sayvidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr.Duffield&rsquo;s reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover ofCervantes.</p><p>From the foregoing history of our translations of &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; it willbe seen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the merenarrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, and adventuresserved up to them in a form that amuses them, care very little whetherthat form is the one in which Cervantes originally shaped his ideas. Onthe other hand, it is clear that there are many who desire to have notmerely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it, so far at leastas differences of idiom and circumstances permit, and who will give apreference to the conscientious translator, even though he may haveacquitted himself somewhat awkwardly.</p><p>But after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes; thereis no reason why what pleases the one should not please the other, or whya translator who makes it his aim to treat &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; with the respectdue to a great classic, should not be as acceptable even to the carelessreader as the one who treats it as a famous old jest-book. It is not aquestion of caviare to the general, or, if it is, the fault rests with himwho makes so. The method by which Cervantes won the ear of the Spanishpeople ought, mutatis mutandis, to be equally effective with the greatmajority of English readers. At any rate, even if there are readers towhom it is a matter of indifference, fidelity to the method is as much apart of the translator&rsquo;s duty as fidelity to the matter. If he can pleaseall parties, so much the better; but his first duty is to those who lookto him for as faithful a representation of his author as it is in hispower to give them, faithful to the letter so long as fidelity ispracticable, faithful to the spirit so far as he can make it.</p><p>My purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation, but toindicate those I have followed, or at least tried to the best of myability to follow, in the present instance. One which, it seems to me,cannot be too rigidly followed in translating &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; is to avoideverything that savours of affectation. The book itself is, indeed, in onesense a protest against it, and no man abhorred it more than Cervantes.For this reason, I think, any temptation to use antiquated or obsoletelanguage should be resisted. It is after all an affectation, and one forwhich there is no warrant or excuse. Spanish has probably undergone lesschange since the seventeenth century than any language in Europe, and byfar the greater and certainly the best part of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; differs butlittle in language from the colloquial Spanish of the present day. Exceptin the tales and Don Quixote&rsquo;s speeches, the translator who uses thesimplest and plainest everyday language will almost always be the one whoapproaches nearest to the original.</p><p>Seeing that the story of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; and all its characters andincidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar ashousehold words in English mouths, it seems to me that the old familiarnames and phrases should not be changed without good reason. Of course atranslator who holds that &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; should receive the treatment agreat classic deserves, will feel himself bound by the injunction laidupon the Morisco in Chap. IX not to omit or add anything.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="pref03"></a>CERVANTES</h3><p>Four generations had laughed over &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; before it occurred toanyone to ask, who and what manner of man was this Miguel de CervantesSaavedra whose name is on the title-page; and it was too late for asatisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a life ofthe author to the London edition published at Lord Carteret&rsquo;s instance in1738. All traces of the personality of Cervantes had by that timedisappeared. Any floating traditions that may once have existed,transmitted from men who had known him, had long since died out, and ofother record there was none; for the sixteenth and seventeenth centurieswere incurious as to &ldquo;the men of the time,&rdquo; a reproach against which thenineteenth has, at any rate, secured itself, if it has produced noShakespeare or Cervantes. All that Mayans y Siscar, to whom the task wasentrusted, or any of those who followed him, Rios, Pellicer, or Navarrete,could do was to eke out the few allusions Cervantes makes to himself inhis various prefaces with such pieces of documentary evidence bearing uponhis life as they could find.</p><p>This, however, has been done by the last-named biographer to such goodpurpose that he has superseded all predecessors. Thoroughness is the chiefcharacteristic of Navarrete&rsquo;s work. Besides sifting, testing, andmethodising with rare patience and judgment what had been previouslybrought to light, he left, as the saying is, no stone unturned under whichanything to illustrate his subject might possibly be found. Navarrete hasdone all that industry and acumen could do, and it is no fault of his ifhe has not given us what we want. What Hallam says of Shakespeare may beapplied to the almost parallel case of Cervantes: &ldquo;It is not the registerof his baptism, or the draft of his will, or the orthography of his namethat we seek; no letter of his writing, no record of his conversation, nocharacter of him drawn ... by a contemporary has been produced.&rdquo;</p><p>It is only natural, therefore, that the biographers of Cervantes, forcedto make brick without straw, should have recourse largely to conjecture,and that conjecture should in some instances come by degrees to take theplace of established fact. All that I propose to do here is to separatewhat is matter of fact from what is matter of conjecture, and leave it tothe reader&rsquo;s judgment to decide whether the data justify the inference ornot.</p><p>The men whose names by common consent stand in the front rank of Spanishliterature, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Calderon, Garcilaso de laVega, the Mendozas, Gongora, were all men of ancient families, and,curiously, all, except the last, of families that traced their origin tothe same mountain district in the North of Spain. The family of Cervantesis commonly said to have been of Galician origin, and unquestionably itwas in possession of lands in Galicia at a very early date; but I thinkthe balance of the evidence tends to show that the &ldquo;solar,&rdquo; the originalsite of the family, was at Cervatos in the north-west corner of OldCastile, close to the junction of Castile, Leon, and the Asturias. As ithappens, there is a complete history of the Cervantes family from thetenth century down to the seventeenth extant under the title of&ldquo;Illustrious Ancestry, Glorious Deeds, and Noble Posterity of the FamousNuno Alfonso, Alcaide of Toledo,&rdquo; written in 1648 by the industriousgenealogist Rodrigo Mendez Silva, who availed himself of a manuscriptgenealogy by Juan de Mena, the poet laureate and historiographer of JohnII.</p><p>The origin of the name Cervantes is curious. Nuno Alfonso was almost asdistinguished in the struggle against the Moors in the reign of AlfonsoVII as the Cid had been half a century before in that of Alfonso VI, andwas rewarded by divers grants of land in the neighbourhood of Toledo. Onone of his acquisitions, about two leagues from the city, he built himselfa castle which he called Cervatos, because &ldquo;he was lord of the solar ofCervatos in the Montana,&rdquo; as the mountain region extending from the BasqueProvinces to Leon was always called. At his death in battle in 1143, thecastle passed by his will to his son Alfonso Munio, who, as territorial orlocal surnames were then coming into vogue in place of the simplepatronymic, took the additional name of Cervatos. His eldest son Pedrosucceeded him in the possession of the castle, and followed his example inadopting the name, an assumption at which the younger son, Gonzalo, seemsto have taken umbrage.</p><p>Everyone who has paid even a flying visit to Toledo will remember theruined castle that crowns the hill above the spot where the bridge ofAlcántara spans the gorge of the Tagus, and with its broken outline andcrumbling walls makes such an admirable pendant to the square solidAlcazar towering over the city roofs on the opposite side. It was built,or as some say restored, by Alfonso VI shortly after his occupation ofToledo in 1085, and called by him San Servando after a Spanish martyr, aname subsequently modified into San Servan (in which form it appears inthe &ldquo;Poem of the Cid&rdquo;), San Servantes, and San Cervantes: with regard towhich last the &ldquo;Handbook for Spain&rdquo; warns its readers against thesupposition that it has anything to do with the author of &ldquo;Don Quixote.&rdquo;Ford, as all know who have taken him for a companion and counsellor on theroads of Spain, is seldom wrong in matters of literature or history. Inthis instance, however, he is in error. It has everything to do with theauthor of &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; for it is in fact these old walls that have givento Spain the name she is proudest of to-day. Gonzalo, above mentioned, itmay be readily conceived, did not relish the appropriation by his brotherof a name to which he himself had an equal right, for though nominallytaken from the castle, it was in reality derived from the ancientterritorial possession of the family, and as a set-off, and to distinguishhimself (diferenciarse) from his brother, he took as a surname the name ofthe castle on the bank of the Tagus, in the building of which, accordingto a family tradition, his great-grandfather had a share.</p><p>Both brothers founded families. The Cervantes branch had more tenacity; itsent offshoots in various directions, Andalusia, Estremadura, Galicia, andPortugal, and produced a goodly line of men distinguished in the serviceof Church and State. Gonzalo himself, and apparently a son of his,followed Ferdinand III in the great campaign of 1236-48 that gave Cordovaand Seville to Christian Spain and penned up the Moors in the kingdom ofGranada, and his descendants intermarried with some of the noblestfamilies of the Peninsula and numbered among them soldiers, magistrates,and Church dignitaries, including at least two cardinal-archbishops.</p><p>Of the line that settled in Andalusia, Deigo de Cervantes, Commander ofthe Order of Santiago, married Juana Avellaneda, daughter of Juan Arias deSaavedra, and had several sons, of whom one was Gonzalo Gomez, Corregidorof Jerez and ancestor of the Mexican and Columbian branches of the family;and another, Juan, whose son Rodrigo married Doña Leonor de Cortinas, andby her had four children, Rodrigo, Andrea, Luisa, and Miguel, our author.</p><p>The pedigree of Cervantes is not without its bearing on &ldquo;Don Quixote.&rdquo; Aman who could look back upon an ancestry of genuine knights-errantextending from well-nigh the time of Pelayo to the siege of Granada waslikely to have a strong feeling on the subject of the sham chivalry of theromances. It gives a point, too, to what he says in more than one placeabout families that have once been great and have tapered away until theyhave come to nothing, like a pyramid. It was the case of his own.</p><p>He was born at Alcalá de Henares and baptised in the church of Santa MariaMayor on the 9th of October, 1547. Of his boyhood and youth we knownothing, unless it be from the glimpse he gives us in the preface to his&ldquo;Comedies&rdquo; of himself as a boy looking on with delight while Lope de Ruedaand his company set up their rude plank stage in the plaza and acted therustic farces which he himself afterwards took as the model of hisinterludes. This first glimpse, however, is a significant one, for itshows the early development of that love of the drama which exercised suchan influence on his life and seems to have grown stronger as he grewolder, and of which this very preface, written only a few months beforehis death, is such a striking proof. He gives us to understand, too, thathe was a great reader in his youth; but of this no assurance was needed,for the First Part of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; alone proves a vast amount ofmiscellaneous reading, romances of chivalry, ballads, popular poetry,chronicles, for which he had no time or opportunity except in the firsttwenty years of his life; and his misquotations and mistakes in matters ofdetail are always, it may be noticed, those of a man recalling the readingof his boyhood.</p><p>Other things besides the drama were in their infancy when Cervantes was aboy. The period of his boyhood was in every way a transition period forSpain. The old chivalrous Spain had passed away. The new Spain was themightiest power the world had seen since the Roman Empire and it had notyet been called upon to pay the price of its greatness. By the policy ofFerdinand and Ximenez the sovereign had been made absolute, and the Churchand Inquisition adroitly adjusted to keep him so. The nobles, who hadalways resisted absolutism as strenuously as they had fought the Moors,had been divested of all political power, a like fate had befallen thecities, the free constitutions of Castile and Aragon had been swept away,and the only function that remained to the Cortés was that of grantingmoney at the King&rsquo;s dictation.</p><p>The transition extended to literature. Men who, like Garcilaso de la Vegaand Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, followed the Italian wars, had brought backfrom Italy the products of the post-Renaissance literature, which tookroot and flourished and even threatened to extinguish the native growths.Damon and Thyrsis, Phyllis and Chloe had been fairly naturalised in Spain,together with all the devices of pastoral poetry for investing with an airof novelty the idea of a dispairing shepherd and inflexible shepherdess.As a set-off against this, the old historical and traditional ballads, andthe true pastorals, the songs and ballads of peasant life, were beingcollected assiduously and printed in the cancioneros that succeeded oneanother with increasing rapidity. But the most notable consequence,perhaps, of the spread of printing was the flood of romances of chivalrythat had continued to pour from the press ever since Garci Ordoñez deMontalvo had resuscitated &ldquo;Amadis of Gaul&rdquo; at the beginning of thecentury.</p><p>For a youth fond of reading, solid or light, there could have been nobetter spot in Spain than Alcalá de Henares in the middle of the sixteenthcentury. It was then a busy, populous university town, something more thanthe enterprising rival of Salamanca, and altogether a very different placefrom the melancholy, silent, deserted Alcalá the traveller sees now as hegoes from Madrid to Saragossa. Theology and medicine may have been thestrong points of the university, but the town itself seems to haveinclined rather to the humanities and light literature, and as a producerof books Alcalá was already beginning to compete with the older presses ofToledo, Burgos, Salamanca and Seville.</p><p>A pendant to the picture Cervantes has given us of his first playgoingsmight, no doubt, have been often seen in the streets of Alcalá at thattime; a bright, eager, tawny-haired boy peering into a book-shop where thelatest volumes lay open to tempt the public, wondering, it may be, whatthat little book with the woodcut of the blind beggar and his boy, thatcalled itself &ldquo;Vida de Lazarillo de Tormes, segunda impresion,&rdquo; could beabout; or with eyes brimming over with merriment gazing at one of thosepreposterous portraits of a knight-errant in outrageous panoply and plumeswith which the publishers of chivalry romances loved to embellish thetitle-pages of their folios. If the boy was the father of the man, thesense of the incongruous that was strong at fifty was lively at ten, andsome such reflections as these may have been the true genesis of &ldquo;DonQuixote.&rdquo;</p><p>For his more solid education, we are told, he went to Salamanca. But whyRodrigo de Cervantes, who was very poor, should have sent his son to auniversity a hundred and fifty miles away when he had one at his own door,would be a puzzle, if we had any reason for supposing that he did so. Theonly evidence is a vague statement by Professor Tomas Gonzalez, that heonce saw an old entry of the matriculation of a Miguel de Cervantes. Thisdoes not appear to have been ever seen again; but even if it had, and ifthe date corresponded, it would prove nothing, as there were at least twoother Miguels born about the middle of the century; one of them, moreover,a Cervantes Saavedra, a cousin, no doubt, who was a source of greatembarrassment to the biographers.</p><p>That he was a student neither at Salamanca nor at Alcalá is best proved byhis own works. No man drew more largely upon experience than he did, andhe has nowhere left a single reminiscence of student life&mdash;for the&ldquo;Tia Fingida,&rdquo; if it be his, is not one&mdash;nothing, not even &ldquo;a collegejoke,&rdquo; to show that he remembered days that most men remember best. Allthat we know positively about his education is that Juan Lopez de Hoyos, aprofessor of humanities and belles-lettres of some eminence, calls him his&ldquo;dear and beloved pupil.&rdquo; This was in a little collection of verses bydifferent hands on the death of Isabel de Valois, second queen of PhilipII., published by the professor in 1569, to which Cervantes contributedfour pieces, including an elegy, and an epitaph in the form of a sonnet.It is only by a rare chance that a &ldquo;Lycidas&rdquo; finds its way into a volumeof this sort, and Cervantes was no Milton. His verses are no worse thansuch things usually are; so much, at least, may be said for them.</p><p>By the time the book appeared he had left Spain, and, as fate ordered it, fortwelve years, the most eventful ones of his life. Giulio, afterwards Cardinal,Acquaviva had been sent at the end of 1568 to Philip II. by the Pope on amission, partly of condolence, partly political, and on his return to Rome,which was somewhat brusquely expedited by the King, he took Cervantes with himas his camarero (chamberlain), the office he himself held in the Pope&rsquo;shousehold. The post would no doubt have led to advancement at the Papal Courthad Cervantes retained it, but in the summer of 1570 he resigned it andenlisted as a private soldier in Captain Diego Urbina&rsquo;s company,belonging to Don Miguel de Moncada&rsquo;s regiment, but at that time forming apart of the command of Marc Antony Colonna. What impelled him to this step weknow not, whether it was distaste for the career before him, or purely militaryenthusiasm. It may well have been the latter, for it was a stirring time; theevents, however, which led to the alliance between Spain, Venice, and the Pope,against the common enemy, the Porte, and to the victory of the combined fleetsat Lepanto, belong rather to the history of Europe than to the life ofCervantes. He was one of those that sailed from Messina, in September 1571,under the command of Don John of Austria; but on the morning of the 7th ofOctober, when the Turkish fleet was sighted, he was lying below ill with fever.At the news that the enemy was in sight he rose, and, in spite of theremonstrances of his comrades and superiors, insisted on taking his post,saying he preferred death in the service of God and the King to health. Hisgalley, the <i>Marquesa</i>, was in the thick of the fight, and before it wasover he had received three gunshot wounds, two in the breast and one in theleft hand or arm. On the morning after the battle, according to Navarrete, hehad an interview with the commander-in-chief, Don John, who was making apersonal inspection of the wounded, one result of which was an addition ofthree crowns to his pay, and another, apparently, the friendship of his general.</p><p>How severely Cervantes was wounded may be inferred from the fact, that withyouth, a vigorous frame, and as cheerful and buoyant a temperament as everinvalid had, he was seven months in hospital at Messina before he wasdischarged. He came out with his left hand permanently disabled; he had lostthe use of it, as Mercury told him in the &ldquo;Viaje del Parnaso&rdquo; forthe greater glory of the right. This, however, did not absolutely unfit him forservice, and in April 1572 he joined Manuel Ponce de Leon&rsquo;s company ofLope de Figueroa&rsquo;s regiment, in which, it seems probable, his brotherRodrigo was serving, and shared in the operations of the next three years,including the capture of the Goletta and Tunis. Taking advantage of the lullwhich followed the recapture of these places by the Turks, he obtained leave toreturn to Spain, and sailed from Naples in September 1575 on board the<i>Sun</i> galley, in company with his brother Rodrigo, Pedro Carrillo deQuesada, late Governor of the Goletta, and some others, and furnished withletters from Don John of Austria and the Duke of Sesa, the Viceroy of Sicily,recommending him to the King for the command of a company, on account of hisservices; a <i>dono infelice</i> as events proved. On the 26th they fell inwith a squadron of Algerine galleys, and after a stout resistance wereoverpowered and carried into Algiers.</p><p>By means of a ransomed fellow-captive the brothers contrived to informtheir family of their condition, and the poor people at Alcalá at oncestrove to raise the ransom money, the father disposing of all hepossessed, and the two sisters giving up their marriage portions. But DaliMami had found on Cervantes the letters addressed to the King by Don Johnand the Duke of Sesa, and, concluding that his prize must be a person ofgreat consequence, when the money came he refused it scornfully as beingaltogether insufficient. The owner of Rodrigo, however, was more easilysatisfied; ransom was accepted in his case, and it was arranged betweenthe brothers that he should return to Spain and procure a vessel in whichhe was to come back to Algiers and take off Miguel and as many of theircomrades as possible. This was not the first attempt to escape thatCervantes had made. Soon after the commencement of his captivity heinduced several of his companions to join him in trying to reach Oran,then a Spanish post, on foot; but after the first day&rsquo;s journey, the Moorwho had agreed to act as their guide deserted them, and they had no choicebut to return. The second attempt was more disastrous. In a garden outsidethe city on the sea-shore, he constructed, with the help of the gardener,a Spaniard, a hiding-place, to which he brought, one by one, fourteen ofhis fellow-captives, keeping them there in secrecy for several months, andsupplying them with food through a renegade known as El Dorador, &ldquo;theGilder.&rdquo; How he, a captive himself, contrived to do all this, is one ofthe mysteries of the story. Wild as the project may appear, it was verynearly successful. The vessel procured by Rodrigo made its appearance offthe coast, and under cover of night was proceeding to take off therefugees, when the crew were alarmed by a passing fishing boat, and beat ahasty retreat. On renewing the attempt shortly afterwards, they, or aportion of them at least, were taken prisoners, and just as the poorfellows in the garden were exulting in the thought that in a few momentsmore freedom would be within their grasp, they found themselves surroundedby Turkish troops, horse and foot. The Dorador had revealed the wholescheme to the Dey Hassan.</p><p>When Cervantes saw what had befallen them, he charged his companions tolay all the blame upon him, and as they were being bound he declared aloudthat the whole plot was of his contriving, and that nobody else had anyshare in it. Brought before the Dey, he said the same. He was threatenedwith impalement and with torture; and as cutting off ears and noses wereplayful freaks with the Algerines, it may be conceived what their tortureswere like; but nothing could make him swerve from his original statementthat he and he alone was responsible. The upshot was that the unhappygardener was hanged by his master, and the prisoners taken possession ofby the Dey, who, however, afterwards restored most of them to theirmasters, but kept Cervantes, paying Dali Mami 500 crowns for him. He felt,no doubt, that a man of such resource, energy, and daring, was toodangerous a piece of property to be left in private hands; and he had himheavily ironed and lodged in his own prison. If he thought that by thesemeans he could break the spirit or shake the resolution of his prisoner,he was soon undeceived, for Cervantes contrived before long to despatch aletter to the Governor of Oran, entreating him to send him someone thatcould be trusted, to enable him and three other gentlemen, fellow-captivesof his, to make their escape; intending evidently to renew his firstattempt with a more trustworthy guide. Unfortunately the Moor who carriedthe letter was stopped just outside Oran, and the letter being found uponhim, he was sent back to Algiers, where by the order of the Dey he waspromptly impaled as a warning to others, while Cervantes was condemned toreceive two thousand blows of the stick, a number which most likely wouldhave deprived the world of &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; had not some persons, who theywere we know not, interceded on his behalf.</p><p>After this he seems to have been kept in still closer confinement thanbefore, for nearly two years passed before he made another attempt. Thistime his plan was to purchase, by the aid of a Spanish renegade and twoValencian merchants resident in Algiers, an armed vessel in which he andabout sixty of the leading captives were to make their escape; but just asthey were about to put it into execution one Doctor Juan Blanco de Paz, anecclesiastic and a compatriot, informed the Dey of the plot. Cervantes byforce of character, by his self-devotion, by his untiring energy and hisexertions to lighten the lot of his companions in misery, had endearedhimself to all, and become the leading spirit in the captive colony, and,incredible as it may seem, jealousy of his influence and the esteem inwhich he was held, moved this man to compass his destruction by a crueldeath. The merchants finding that the Dey knew all, and fearing thatCervantes under torture might make disclosures that would imperil theirown lives, tried to persuade him to slip away on board a vessel that wason the point of sailing for Spain; but he told them they had nothing tofear, for no tortures would make him compromise anybody, and he went atonce and gave himself up to the Dey.</p><p>As before, the Dey tried to force him to name his accomplices. Everythingwas made ready for his immediate execution; the halter was put round hisneck and his hands tied behind him, but all that could be got from him wasthat he himself, with the help of four gentlemen who had since leftAlgiers, had arranged the whole, and that the sixty who were to accompanyhim were not to know anything of it until the last moment. Finding hecould make nothing of him, the Dey sent him back to prison more heavilyironed than before.</p><p>The poverty-stricken Cervantes family had been all this time trying oncemore to raise the ransom money, and at last a sum of three hundred ducatswas got together and entrusted to the Redemptorist Father Juan Gil, whowas about to sail for Algiers. The Dey, however, demanded more than doublethe sum offered, and as his term of office had expired and he was about tosail for Constantinople, taking all his slaves with him, the case ofCervantes was critical. He was already on board heavily ironed, when theDey at length agreed to reduce his demand by one-half, and Father Gil byborrowing was able to make up the amount, and on September 19, 1580, aftera captivity of five years all but a week, Cervantes was at last set free.Before long he discovered that Blanco de Paz, who claimed to be an officerof the Inquisition, was now concocting on false evidence a charge ofmisconduct to be brought against him on his return to Spain. To checkmatehim Cervantes drew up a series of twenty-five questions, covering thewhole period of his captivity, upon which he requested Father Gil to takethe depositions of credible witnesses before a notary. Eleven witnessestaken from among the principal captives in Algiers deposed to all thefacts above stated and to a great deal more besides. There is somethingtouching in the admiration, love, and gratitude we see struggling to findexpression in the formal language of the notary, as they testify one afteranother to the good deeds of Cervantes, how he comforted and helped theweak-hearted, how he kept up their drooping courage, how he shared hispoor purse with this deponent, and how &ldquo;in him this deponent found fatherand mother.&rdquo;</p><p>On his return to Spain he found his old regiment about to march forPortugal to support Philip&rsquo;s claim to the crown, and utterly pennilessnow, had no choice but to rejoin it. He was in the expeditions to theAzores in 1582 and the following year, and on the conclusion of the warreturned to Spain in the autumn of 1583, bringing with him the manuscriptof his pastoral romance, the &ldquo;Galatea,&rdquo; and probably also, to judge byinternal evidence, that of the first portion of &ldquo;Persiles and Sigismunda.&rdquo;He also brought back with him, his biographers assert, an infant daughter,the offspring of an amour, as some of them with great circumstantialityinform us, with a Lisbon lady of noble birth, whose name, however, as wellas that of the street she lived in, they omit to mention. The solefoundation for all this is that in 1605 there certainly was living in thefamily of Cervantes a Doña Isabel de Saavedra, who is described in anofficial document as his natural daughter, and then twenty years of age.</p><p>With his crippled left hand promotion in the army was hopeless, now thatDon John was dead and he had no one to press his claims and services, andfor a man drawing on to forty life in the ranks was a dismal prospect; hehad already a certain reputation as a poet; he made up his mind,therefore, to cast his lot with literature, and for a first venturecommitted his &ldquo;Galatea&rdquo; to the press. It was published, as Salva y Mallenshows conclusively, at Alcalá, his own birth-place, in 1585 and no doubthelped to make his name more widely known, but certainly did not do himmuch good in any other way.</p><p>While it was going through the press, he married Doña Catalina de PalaciosSalazar y Vozmediano, a lady of Esquivias near Madrid, and apparently afriend of the family, who brought him a fortune which may possibly haveserved to keep the wolf from the door, but if so, that was all. The dramahad by this time outgrown market-place stages and strolling companies, andwith his old love for it he naturally turned to it for a congenialemployment. In about three years he wrote twenty or thirty plays, which hetells us were performed without any throwing of cucumbers or othermissiles, and ran their course without any hisses, outcries, ordisturbance. In other words, his plays were not bad enough to be hissedoff the stage, but not good enough to hold their own upon it. Only two ofthem have been preserved, but as they happen to be two of the seven oreight he mentions with complacency, we may assume they are favourablespecimens, and no one who reads the &ldquo;Numancia&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Trato de Argel&rdquo;will feel any surprise that they failed as acting dramas. Whatever meritsthey may have, whatever occasional they may show, they are, as regardsconstruction, incurably clumsy. How completely they failed is manifestfrom the fact that with all his sanguine temperament and indomitableperseverance he was unable to maintain the struggle to gain a livelihoodas a dramatist for more than three years; nor was the rising popularity ofLope the cause, as is often said, notwithstanding his own words to thecontrary. When Lope began to write for the stage is uncertain, but it wascertainly after Cervantes went to Seville.</p><p>Among the &ldquo;Nuevos Documentos&rdquo; printed by Señor Asensio y Toledo is onedated 1592, and curiously characteristic of Cervantes. It is an agreementwith one Rodrigo Osorio, a manager, who was to accept six comedies atfifty ducats (about 6l.) apiece, not to be paid in any case unless itappeared on representation that the said comedy was one of the best thathad ever been represented in Spain. The test does not seem to have beenever applied; perhaps it was sufficiently apparent to Rodrigo Osorio thatthe comedies were not among the best that had ever been represented. Amongthe correspondence of Cervantes there might have been found, no doubt,more than one letter like that we see in the &ldquo;Rake&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir, Ihave read your play, and it will not doo.&rdquo;</p><p>He was more successful in a literary contest at Saragossa in 1595 inhonour of the canonisation of St. Jacinto, when his composition won thefirst prize, three silver spoons. The year before this he had beenappointed a collector of revenues for the kingdom of Granada. In order toremit the money he had collected more conveniently to the treasury, heentrusted it to a merchant, who failed and absconded; and as thebankrupt&rsquo;s assets were insufficient to cover the whole, he was sent toprison at Seville in September 1597. The balance against him, however, wasa small one, about 26l., and on giving security for it he was released atthe end of the year.</p><p>It was as he journeyed from town to town collecting the king&rsquo;s taxes, thathe noted down those bits of inn and wayside life and character that aboundin the pages of &ldquo;Don Quixote:&rdquo; the Benedictine monks with spectacles andsunshades, mounted on their tall mules; the strollers in costume bound forthe next village; the barber with his basin on his head, on his way tobleed a patient; the recruit with his breeches in his bundle, trampingalong the road singing; the reapers gathered in the venta gatewaylistening to &ldquo;Felixmarte of Hircania&rdquo; read out to them; and those littleHogarthian touches that he so well knew how to bring in, the ox-tailhanging up with the landlord&rsquo;s comb stuck in it, the wine-skins at thebed-head, and those notable examples of hostelry art, Helen going off inhigh spirits on Paris&rsquo;s arm, and Dido on the tower dropping tears as bigas walnuts. Nay, it may well be that on those journeys into remote regionshe came across now and then a specimen of the pauper gentleman, with hislean hack and his greyhound and his books of chivalry, dreaming away hislife in happy ignorance that the world had changed since hisgreat-grandfather&rsquo;s old helmet was new. But it was in Seville that hefound out his true vocation, though he himself would not by any means haveadmitted it to be so. It was there, in Triana, that he was first temptedto try his hand at drawing from life, and first brought his humour intoplay in the exquisite little sketch of &ldquo;Rinconete y Cortadillo,&rdquo; the germ,in more ways than one, of &ldquo;Don Quixote.&rdquo;</p><p>Where and when that was written, we cannot tell. After his imprisonmentall trace of Cervantes in his official capacity disappears, from which itmay be inferred that he was not reinstated. That he was still in Sevillein November 1598 appears from a satirical sonnet of his on the elaboratecatafalque erected to testify the grief of the city at the death of PhilipII, but from this up to 1603 we have no clue to his movements. The wordsin the preface to the First Part of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; are generally held to beconclusive that he conceived the idea of the book, and wrote the beginningof it at least, in a prison, and that he may have done so is extremelylikely.</p><p>There is a tradition that Cervantes read some portions of his work to aselect audience at the Duke of Bejar&rsquo;s, which may have helped to make thebook known; but the obvious conclusion is that the First Part of &ldquo;DonQuixote&rdquo; lay on his hands some time before he could find a publisher boldenough to undertake a venture of so novel a character; and so little faithin it had Francisco Robles of Madrid, to whom at last he sold it, that hedid not care to incur the expense of securing the copyright for Aragon orPortugal, contenting himself with that for Castile. The printing wasfinished in December, and the book came out with the new year, 1605. It isoften said that &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; was at first received coldly. The facts showjust the contrary. No sooner was it in the hands of the public thanpreparations were made to issue pirated editions at Lisbon and Valencia,and to bring out a second edition with the additional copyrights forAragon and Portugal, which he secured in February.</p><p>No doubt it was received with something more than coldness by certainsections of the community. Men of wit, taste, and discrimination among thearistocracy gave it a hearty welcome, but the aristocracy in general werenot likely to relish a book that turned their favourite reading intoridicule and laughed at so many of their favourite ideas. The dramatistswho gathered round Lope as their leader regarded Cervantes as their commonenemy, and it is plain that he was equally obnoxious to the other clique,the culto poets who had Gongora for their chief. Navarrete, who knewnothing of the letter above mentioned, tries hard to show that therelations between Cervantes and Lope were of a very friendly sort, asindeed they were until &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; was written. Cervantes, indeed, tothe last generously and manfully declared his admiration of Lope&rsquo;s powers,his unfailing invention, and his marvellous fertility; but in the prefaceof the First Part of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; and in the verses of &ldquo;Urganda theUnknown,&rdquo; and one or two other places, there are, if we read between thelines, sly hits at Lope&rsquo;s vanities and affectations that argue no personalgood-will; and Lope openly sneers at &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; and Cervantes, andfourteen years after his death gives him only a few lines of coldcommonplace in the &ldquo;Laurel de Apolo,&rdquo; that seem all the colder for theeulogies of a host of nonentities whose names are found nowhere else.</p><p>In 1601 Valladolid was made the seat of the Court, and at the beginning of1603 Cervantes had been summoned thither in connection with the balancedue by him to the Treasury, which was still outstanding. He remained atValladolid, apparently supporting himself by agencies and scrivener&rsquo;s workof some sort; probably drafting petitions and drawing up statements ofclaims to be presented to the Council, and the like. So, at least, wegather from the depositions taken on the occasion of the death of agentleman, the victim of a street brawl, who had been carried into thehouse in which he lived. In these he himself is described as a man whowrote and transacted business, and it appears that his household thenconsisted of his wife, the natural daughter Isabel de Saavedra alreadymentioned, his sister Andrea, now a widow, her daughter Constanza, amysterious Magdalena de Sotomayor calling herself his sister, for whom hisbiographers cannot account, and a servant-maid.</p><p>Meanwhile &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; had been growing in favour, and its author&rsquo;s namewas now known beyond the Pyrenees. In 1607 an edition was printed atBrussels. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet thedemand by a third edition, the seventh in all, in 1608. The popularity ofthe book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller was led to bring out anedition in 1610; and another was called for in Brussels in 1611. It mightnaturally have been expected that, with such proofs before him that he hadhit the taste of the public, Cervantes would have at once set aboutredeeming his rather vague promise of a second volume.</p><p>But, to all appearance, nothing was farther from his thoughts. He hadstill by him one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he hadinserted in &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; and instead of continuing the adventures of DonQuixote, he set to work to write more of these &ldquo;Novelas Exemplares&rdquo; as heafterwards called them, with a view to making a book of them.</p><p>The novels were published in the summer of 1613, with a dedication to theConde de Lemos, the Maecenas of the day, and with one of those chattyconfidential prefaces Cervantes was so fond of. In this, eight years and ahalf after the First Part of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; had appeared, we get the firsthint of a forthcoming Second Part. &ldquo;You shall see shortly,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;thefurther exploits of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza.&rdquo; His idea of&ldquo;shortly&rdquo; was a somewhat elastic one, for, as we know by the date toSancho&rsquo;s letter, he had barely one-half of the book completed that timetwelvemonth.</p><p>But more than poems, or pastorals, or novels, it was his dramatic ambitionthat engrossed his thoughts. The same indomitable spirit that kept himfrom despair in the bagnios of Algiers, and prompted him to attempt theescape of himself and his comrades again and again, made him persevere inspite of failure and discouragement in his efforts to win the ear of thepublic as a dramatist. The temperament of Cervantes was essentiallysanguine. The portrait he draws in the preface to the novels, with theaquiline features, chestnut hair, smooth untroubled forehead, and brightcheerful eyes, is the very portrait of a sanguine man. Nothing that themanagers might say could persuade him that the merits of his plays wouldnot be recognised at last if they were only given a fair chance. The oldsoldier of the Spanish Salamis was bent on being the Aeschylus of Spain.He was to found a great national drama, based on the true principles ofart, that was to be the envy of all nations; he was to drive from thestage the silly, childish plays, the &ldquo;mirrors of nonsense and models offolly&rdquo; that were in vogue through the cupidity of the managers andshortsightedness of the authors; he was to correct and educate the publictaste until it was ripe for tragedies on the model of the Greek drama&mdash;likethe &ldquo;Numancia&rdquo; for instance&mdash;and comedies that would not only amusebut improve and instruct. All this he was to do, could he once get ahearing: there was the initial difficulty.</p><p>He shows plainly enough, too, that &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; and the demolition of thechivalry romances was not the work that lay next his heart. He was,indeed, as he says himself in his preface, more a stepfather than a fatherto &ldquo;Don Quixote.&rdquo; Never was great work so neglected by its author. That itwas written carelessly, hastily, and by fits and starts, was not alwayshis fault, but it seems clear he never read what he sent to the press. Heknew how the printers had blundered, but he never took the trouble tocorrect them when the third edition was in progress, as a man who reallycared for the child of his brain would have done. He appears to haveregarded the book as little more than a mere libro de entretenimiento, anamusing book, a thing, as he says in the &ldquo;Viaje,&rdquo; &ldquo;to divert themelancholy moody heart at any time or season.&rdquo; No doubt he had anaffection for his hero, and was very proud of Sancho Panza. It would havebeen strange indeed if he had not been proud of the most humorous creationin all fiction. He was proud, too, of the popularity and success of thebook, and beyond measure delightful is the naivete with which he shows hispride in a dozen passages in the Second Part. But it was not the successhe coveted. In all probability he would have given all the success of &ldquo;DonQuixote,&rdquo; nay, would have seen every copy of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; burned in thePlaza Mayor, for one such success as Lope de Vega was enjoying on anaverage once a week.</p><p>And so he went on, dawdling over &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; adding a chapter now andagain, and putting it aside to turn to &ldquo;Persiles and Sigismunda&rdquo;&mdash;which,as we know, was to be the most entertaining book in the language, and therival of &ldquo;Theagenes and Chariclea&rdquo;&mdash;or finishing off one of hisdarling comedies; and if Robles asked when &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; would be ready,the answer no doubt was: En breve&mdash;shortly, there was time enough forthat. At sixty-eight he was as full of life and hope and plans for thefuture as a boy of eighteen.</p><p>Nemesis was coming, however. He had got as far as Chapter LIX, which athis leisurely pace he could hardly have reached before October or November1614, when there was put into his hand a small octave lately printed atTarragona, and calling itself &ldquo;Second Volume of the Ingenious GentlemanDon Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licentiate Alonso Fernandez de Avellanedaof Tordesillas.&rdquo; The last half of Chapter LIX and most of the followingchapters of the Second Part give us some idea of the effect produced uponhim, and his irritation was not likely to be lessened by the reflectionthat he had no one to blame but himself. Had Avellaneda, in fact, beencontent with merely bringing out a continuation to &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo;Cervantes would have had no reasonable grievance. His own intentions wereexpressed in the very vaguest language at the end of the book; nay, in hislast words, &ldquo;forse altro cantera con miglior plettro,&rdquo; he seems actuallyto invite someone else to continue the work, and he made no sign untileight years and a half had gone by; by which time Avellaneda&rsquo;s volume wasno doubt written.</p><p>In fact Cervantes had no case, or a very bad one, as far as the merecontinuation was concerned. But Avellaneda chose to write a preface to it,full of such coarse personal abuse as only an ill-conditioned man couldpour out. He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having lost his hand,with having been in prison, with being poor, with being friendless,accuses him of envy of Lope&rsquo;s success, of petulance and querulousness, andso on; and it was in this that the sting lay. Avellaneda&rsquo;s reason for thispersonal attack is obvious enough. Whoever he may have been, it is clearthat he was one of the dramatists of Lope&rsquo;s school, for he has theimpudence to charge Cervantes with attacking him as well as Lope in hiscriticism on the drama. His identification has exercised the best criticsand baffled all the ingenuity and research that has been brought to bearon it. Navarrete and Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantesknew who he was; but I must say I think the anger he shows suggests aninvisible assailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by amosquito in the dark. Cervantes from certain solecisms of languagepronounces him to be an Aragonese, and Pellicer, an Aragonese himself,supports this view and believes him, moreover, to have been anecclesiastic, a Dominican probably.</p><p>Any merit Avellaneda has is reflected from Cervantes, and he is too dullto reflect much. &ldquo;Dull and dirty&rdquo; will always be, I imagine, the verdictof the vast majority of unprejudiced readers. He is, at best, a poorplagiarist; all he can do is to follow slavishly the lead given him byCervantes; his only humour lies in making Don Quixote take inns forcastles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage, andSancho mistake words, invert proverbs, and display his gluttony; allthrough he shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt, and he has contrivedto introduce two tales filthier than anything by the sixteenth centurynovellieri and without their sprightliness.</p><p>But whatever Avellaneda and his book may be, we must not forget the debtwe owe them. But for them, there can be no doubt, &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; would havecome to us a mere torso instead of a complete work. Even if Cervantes hadfinished the volume he had in hand, most assuredly he would have left offwith a promise of a Third Part, giving the further adventures of DonQuixote and humours of Sancho Panza as shepherds. It is plain that he hadat one time an intention of dealing with the pastoral romances as he haddealt with the books of chivalry, and but for Avellaneda he would havetried to carry it out. But it is more likely that, with his plans, andprojects, and hopefulness, the volume would have remained unfinished tillhis death, and that we should have never made the acquaintance of the Dukeand Duchess, or gone with Sancho to Barataria.</p><p>From the moment the book came into his hands he seems to have been hauntedby the fear that there might be more Avellanedas in the field, and puttingeverything else aside, he set himself to finish off his task and protectDon Quixote in the only way he could, by killing him. The conclusion is nodoubt a hasty and in some places clumsy piece of work and the frequentrepetition of the scolding administered to Avellaneda becomes in the endrather wearisome; but it is, at any rate, a conclusion and for that wemust thank Avellaneda.</p><p>The new volume was ready for the press in February, but was not printedtill the very end of 1615, and during the interval Cervantes put togetherthe comedies and interludes he had written within the last few years, and,as he adds plaintively, found no demand for among the managers, andpublished them with a preface, worth the book it introduces tenfold, inwhich he gives an account of the early Spanish stage, and of his ownattempts as a dramatist. It is needless to say they were put forward byCervantes in all good faith and full confidence in their merits. Thereader, however, was not to suppose they were his last word or finaleffort in the drama, for he had in hand a comedy called &ldquo;Engano a losojos,&rdquo; about which, if he mistook not, there would be no question.</p><p>Of this dramatic masterpiece the world has no opportunity of judging; hishealth had been failing for some time, and he died, apparently of dropsy,on the 23rd of April, 1616, the day on which England lost Shakespeare,nominally at least, for the English calendar had not yet been reformed. Hedied as he had lived, accepting his lot bravely and cheerfully.</p><p>Was it an unhappy life, that of Cervantes? His biographers all tell usthat it was; but I must say I doubt it. It was a hard life, a life ofpoverty, of incessant struggle, of toil ill paid, of disappointment, butCervantes carried within himself the antidote to all these evils. His wasnot one of those light natures that rise above adversity merely by virtueof their own buoyancy; it was in the fortitude of a high spirit that hewas proof against it. It is impossible to conceive Cervantes giving way todespondency or prostrated by dejection. As for poverty, it was with him athing to be laughed over, and the only sigh he ever allows to escape himis when he says, &ldquo;Happy he to whom Heaven has given a piece of bread forwhich he is not bound to give thanks to any but Heaven itself.&rdquo; Add to allthis his vital energy and mental activity, his restless invention and hissanguine temperament, and there will be reason enough to doubt whether hiscould have been a very unhappy life. He who could take Cervantes&rsquo;distresses together with his apparatus for enduring them would not make sobad a bargain, perhaps, as far as happiness in life is concerned.</p><p>Of his burial-place nothing is known except that he was buried, inaccordance with his will, in the neighbouring convent of Trinitarian nuns,of which it is supposed his daughter, Isabel de Saavedra, was an inmate,and that a few years afterwards the nuns removed to another convent,carrying their dead with them. But whether the remains of Cervantes wereincluded in the removal or not no one knows, and the clue to theirresting-place is now lost beyond all hope. This furnishes perhaps theleast defensible of the items in the charge of neglect brought against hiscontemporaries. In some of the others there is a good deal ofexaggeration. To listen to most of his biographers one would suppose thatall Spain was in league not only against the man but against his memory,or at least that it was insensible to his merits, and left him to live inmisery and die of want. To talk of his hard life and unworthy employmentsin Andalusia is absurd. What had he done to distinguish him from thousandsof other struggling men earning a precarious livelihood? True, he was agallant soldier, who had been wounded and had undergone captivity andsuffering in his country&rsquo;s cause, but there were hundreds of others in thesame case. He had written a mediocre specimen of an insipid class ofromance, and some plays which manifestly did not comply with the primarycondition of pleasing: were the playgoers to patronise plays that did notamuse them, because the author was to produce &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; twenty yearsafterwards?</p><p>The scramble for copies which, as we have seen, followed immediately onthe appearance of the book, does not look like general insensibility toits merits. No doubt it was received coldly by some, but if a man writes abook in ridicule of periwigs he must make his account with being coldlyreceived by the periwig wearers and hated by the whole tribe of wigmakers.If Cervantes had the chivalry-romance readers, the sentimentalists, thedramatists, and the poets of the period all against him, it was because&ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; was what it was; and if the general public did not comeforward to make him comfortable for the rest of his days, it is no more tobe charged with neglect and ingratitude than the English-speaking publicthat did not pay off Scott&rsquo;s liabilities. It did the best it could; itread his book and liked it and bought it, and encouraged the bookseller topay him well for others.</p><p>It has been also made a reproach to Spain that she has erected no monumentto the man she is proudest of; no monument, that is to say, of him; forthe bronze statue in the little garden of the Plaza de las Cortés, a fairwork of art no doubt, and unexceptionable had it been set up to the localpoet in the market-place of some provincial town, is not worthy ofCervantes or of Madrid. But what need has Cervantes of &ldquo;such weak witnessof his name;&rdquo; or what could a monument do in his case except testify tothe self-glorification of those who had put it up? Si monumentum quoeris,circumspice. The nearest bookseller&rsquo;s shop will show what bathos therewould be in a monument to the author of &ldquo;Don Quixote.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="pref04"></a>&lsquo;DON QUIXOTE&rsquo;</h3><p>Nine editions of the First Part of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; had already appearedbefore Cervantes died, thirty thousand copies in all, according to his ownestimate, and a tenth was printed at Barcelona the year after his death.So large a number naturally supplied the demand for some time, but by 1634it appears to have been exhausted; and from that time down to the presentday the stream of editions has continued to flow rapidly and regularly.The translations show still more clearly in what request the book has beenfrom the very outset. In seven years from the completion of the work ithad been translated into the four leading languages of Europe. Except theBible, in fact, no book has been so widely diffused as &ldquo;Don Quixote.&rdquo; The&ldquo;Imitatio Christi&rdquo; may have been translated into as many differentlanguages, and perhaps &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield&rdquo; intonearly as many, but in multiplicity of translations and editions &ldquo;DonQuixote&rdquo; leaves them all far behind.</p><p>Still more remarkable is the character of this wide diffusion. &ldquo;DonQuixote&rdquo; has been thoroughly naturalised among people whose ideas aboutknight-errantry, if they had any at all, were of the vaguest, who hadnever seen or heard of a book of chivalry, who could not possibly feel thehumour of the burlesque or sympathise with the author&rsquo;s purpose. Anothercurious fact is that this, the most cosmopolitan book in the world, is oneof the most intensely national. &ldquo;Manon Lescaut&rdquo; is not more thoroughlyFrench, &ldquo;Tom Jones&rdquo; not more English, &ldquo;Rob Roy&rdquo; not more Scotch, than &ldquo;DonQuixote&rdquo; is Spanish, in character, in ideas, in sentiment, in localcolour, in everything. What, then, is the secret of this unparalleledpopularity, increasing year by year for well-nigh three centuries? Oneexplanation, no doubt, is that of all the books in the world, &ldquo;DonQuixote&rdquo; is the most catholic. There is something in it for every sort ofreader, young or old, sage or simple, high or low. As Cervantes himselfsays with a touch of pride, &ldquo;It is thumbed and read and got by heart bypeople of all sorts; the children turn its leaves, the young people readit, the grown men understand it, the old folk praise it.&rdquo;</p><p>But it would be idle to deny that the ingredient which, more than itshumour, or its wisdom, or the fertility of invention or knowledge of humannature it displays, has insured its success with the multitude, is thevein of farce that runs through it. It was the attack upon the sheep, thebattle with the wine-skins, Mambrino&rsquo;s helmet, the balsam of Fierabras,Don Quixote knocked over by the sails of the windmill, Sancho tossed inthe blanket, the mishaps and misadventures of master and man, that wereoriginally the great attraction, and perhaps are so still to some extentwith the majority of readers. It is plain that &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; was generallyregarded at first, and indeed in Spain for a long time, as little morethan a queer droll book, full of laughable incidents and absurdsituations, very amusing, but not entitled to much consideration or care.All the editions printed in Spain from 1637 to 1771, when the famousprinter Ibarra took it up, were mere trade editions, badly and carelesslyprinted on vile paper and got up in the style of chap-books intended onlyfor popular use, with, in most instances, uncouth illustrations andclap-trap additions by the publisher.</p><p>To England belongs the credit of having been the first country to recognise theright of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; to better treatment than this. The Londonedition of 1738, commonly called Lord Carteret&rsquo;s from having beensuggested by him, was not a mere <i>édition de luxe</i>. It produced &ldquo;DonQuixote&rdquo; in becoming form as regards paper and type, and embellished withplates which, if not particularly happy as illustrations, were at least wellintentioned and well executed, but it also aimed at correctness of text, amatter to which nobody except the editors of the Valencia and Brussels editionshad given even a passing thought; and for a first attempt it was fairlysuccessful, for though some of its emendations are inadmissible, a good many ofthem have been adopted by all subsequent editors.</p><p>The zeal of publishers, editors, and annotators brought about a remarkablechange of sentiment with regard to &ldquo;Don Quixote.&rdquo; A vast number of itsadmirers began to grow ashamed of laughing over it. It became almost acrime to treat it as a humorous book. The humour was not entirely denied,but, according to the new view, it was rated as an altogether secondaryquality, a mere accessory, nothing more than the stalking-horse under thepresentation of which Cervantes shot his philosophy or his satire, orwhatever it was he meant to shoot; for on this point opinions varied. Allwere agreed, however, that the object he aimed at was not the books ofchivalry. He said emphatically in the preface to the First Part and in thelast sentence of the Second, that he had no other object in view than todiscredit these books, and this, to advanced criticism, made it clear thathis object must have been something else.</p><p>One theory was that the book was a kind of allegory, setting forth theeternal struggle between the ideal and the real, between the spirit ofpoetry and the spirit of prose; and perhaps German philosophy neverevolved a more ungainly or unlikely camel out of the depths of its innerconsciousness. Something of the antagonism, no doubt, is to be found in&ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; because it is to be found everywhere in life, and Cervantesdrew from life. It is difficult to imagine a community in which thenever-ceasing game of cross-purposes between Sancho Panza and Don Quixotewould not be recognised as true to nature. In the stone age, among thelake dwellers, among the cave men, there were Don Quixotes and SanchoPanzas; there must have been the troglodyte who never could see the factsbefore his eyes, and the troglodyte who could see nothing else. But tosuppose Cervantes deliberately setting himself to expound any such idea intwo stout quarto volumes is to suppose something not only very unlike theage in which he lived, but altogether unlike Cervantes himself, who wouldhave been the first to laugh at an attempt of the sort made by anyoneelse.</p><p>The extraordinary influence of the romances of chivalry in his day isquite enough to account for the genesis of the book. Some idea of theprodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenthcentury may be obtained from the scrutiny of Chapter VII, if the readerbears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by far thelargest group are enumerated. As to its effect upon the nation, there isabundant evidence. From the time when the Amadises and Palmerins began togrow popular down to the very end of the century, there is a steady streamof invective, from men whose character and position lend weight to theirwords, against the romances of chivalry and the infatuation of theirreaders. Ridicule was the only besom to sweep away that dust.</p><p>That this was the task Cervantes set himself, and that he had ampleprovocation to urge him to it, will be sufficiently clear to those wholook into the evidence; as it will be also that it was not chivalry itselfthat he attacked and swept away. Of all the absurdities that, thanks topoetry, will be repeated to the end of time, there is no greater one thansaying that &ldquo;Cervantes smiled Spain&rsquo;s chivalry away.&rdquo; In the first placethere was no chivalry for him to smile away. Spain&rsquo;s chivalry had beendead for more than a century. Its work was done when Granada fell, and aschivalry was essentially republican in its nature, it could not live underthe rule that Ferdinand substituted for the free institutions of mediaevalSpain. What he did smile away was not chivalry but a degrading mockery ofit.</p><p>The true nature of the &ldquo;right arm&rdquo; and the &ldquo;bright array,&rdquo; before which,according to the poet, &ldquo;the world gave ground,&rdquo; and which Cervantes&rsquo;single laugh demolished, may be gathered from the words of one of his owncountrymen, Don Felix Pacheco, as reported by Captain George Carleton, inhis &ldquo;Military Memoirs from 1672 to 1713.&rdquo; &ldquo;Before the appearance in theworld of that labour of Cervantes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it was next to animpossibility for a man to walk the streets with any delight or withoutdanger. There were seen so many cavaliers prancing and curvetting beforethe windows of their mistresses, that a stranger would have imagined thewhole nation to have been nothing less than a race of knight-errants. Butafter the world became a little acquainted with that notable history, theman that was seen in that once celebrated drapery was pointed at as a DonQuixote, and found himself the jest of high and low. And I verily believethat to this, and this only, we owe that dampness and poverty of spiritwhich has run through all our councils for a century past, so littleagreeable to those nobler actions of our famous ancestors.&rdquo;</p><p>To call &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; a sad book, preaching a pessimist view of life,argues a total misconception of its drift. It would be so if its moralwere that, in this world, true enthusiasm naturally leads to ridicule anddiscomfiture. But it preaches nothing of the sort; its moral, so far as itcan be said to have one, is that the spurious enthusiasm that is born ofvanity and self-conceit, that is made an end in itself, not a means to anend, that acts on mere impulse, regardless of circumstances andconsequences, is mischievous to its owner, and a very considerablenuisance to the community at large. To those who cannot distinguishbetween the one kind and the other, no doubt &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; is a sad book;no doubt to some minds it is very sad that a man who had just uttered sobeautiful a sentiment as that &ldquo;it is a hard case to make slaves of thosewhom God and Nature made free,&rdquo; should be ungratefully pelted by thescoundrels his crazy philanthropy had let loose on society; but to othersof a more judicial cast it will be a matter of regret that recklessself-sufficient enthusiasm is not oftener requited in some such way forall the mischief it does in the world.</p><p>A very slight examination of the structure of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; will sufficeto show that Cervantes had no deep design or elaborate plan in his mindwhen he began the book. When he wrote those lines in which &ldquo;with a fewstrokes of a great master he sets before us the pauper gentleman,&rdquo; he hadno idea of the goal to which his imagination was leading him. There can belittle doubt that all he contemplated was a short tale to range with thosehe had already written, a tale setting forth the ludicrous results thatmight be expected to follow the attempt of a crazy gentleman to act thepart of a knight-errant in modern life.</p><p>It is plain, for one thing, that Sancho Panza did not enter into theoriginal scheme, for had Cervantes thought of him he certainly would nothave omitted him in his hero&rsquo;s outfit, which he obviously meant to becomplete. Him we owe to the landlord&rsquo;s chance remark in Chapter III thatknights seldom travelled without squires. To try to think of a Don Quixotewithout Sancho Panza is like trying to think of a one-bladed pair ofscissors.</p><p>The story was written at first, like the others, without any division andwithout the intervention of Cid Hamete Benengeli; and it seems notunlikely that Cervantes had some intention of bringing Dulcinea, orAldonza Lorenzo, on the scene in person. It was probably the ransacking ofthe Don&rsquo;s library and the discussion on the books of chivalry that firstsuggested it to him that his idea was capable of development. What, ifinstead of a mere string of farcical misadventures, he were to make histale a burlesque of one of these books, caricaturing their style,incidents, and spirit?</p><p>In pursuance of this change of plan, he hastily and somewhat clumsilydivided what he had written into chapters on the model of &ldquo;Amadis,&rdquo;invented the fable of a mysterious Arabic manuscript, and set up CidHamete Benengeli in imitation of the almost invariable practice of thechivalry-romance authors, who were fond of tracing their books to somerecondite source. In working out the new ideas, he soon found the value ofSancho Panza. Indeed, the keynote, not only to Sancho&rsquo;s part, but to thewhole book, is struck in the first words Sancho utters when he announceshis intention of taking his ass with him. &ldquo;About the ass,&rdquo; we are told,&ldquo;Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he could call to mind anyknight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back; but noinstance occurred to his memory.&rdquo; We can see the whole scene at a glance,the stolid unconsciousness of Sancho and the perplexity of his master,upon whose perception the incongruity has just forced itself. This isSancho&rsquo;s mission throughout the book; he is an unconscious Mephistopheles,always unwittingly making mockery of his master&rsquo;s aspirations, alwaysexposing the fallacy of his ideas by some unintentional ad absurdum,always bringing him back to the world of fact and commonplace by force ofsheer stolidity.</p><p>By the time Cervantes had got his volume of novels off his hands, andsummoned up resolution enough to set about the Second Part in earnest, thecase was very much altered. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had not merelyfound favour, but had already become, what they have never since ceased tobe, veritable entities to the popular imagination. There was no occasionfor him now to interpolate extraneous matter; nay, his readers told himplainly that what they wanted of him was more Don Quixote and more SanchoPanza, and not novels, tales, or digressions. To himself, too, hiscreations had become realities, and he had become proud of them,especially of Sancho. He began the Second Part, therefore, under verydifferent conditions, and the difference makes itself manifest at once.Even in translation the style will be seen to be far easier, more flowing,more natural, and more like that of a man sure of himself and of hisaudience. Don Quixote and Sancho undergo a change also. In the First Part,Don Quixote has no character or individuality whatever. He is nothing morethan a crazy representative of the sentiments of the chivalry romances. Inall that he says and does he is simply repeating the lesson he has learnedfrom his books; and therefore, it is absurd to speak of him in the gushingstrain of the sentimental critics when they dilate upon his nobleness,disinterestedness, dauntless courage, and so forth. It was the business ofa knight-errant to right wrongs, redress injuries, and succour thedistressed, and this, as a matter of course, he makes his business when hetakes up the part; a knight-errant was bound to be intrepid, and so hefeels bound to cast fear aside. Of all Byron&rsquo;s melodious nonsense aboutDon Quixote, the most nonsensical statement is that &ldquo;&rsquo;tis his virtuemakes him mad!&rdquo; The exact opposite is the truth; it is his madness makeshim virtuous.</p><p>In the Second Part, Cervantes repeatedly reminds the reader, as if it wasa point upon which he was anxious there should be no mistake, that hishero&rsquo;s madness is strictly confined to delusions on the subject ofchivalry, and that on every other subject he is discreto, one, in fact,whose faculty of discernment is in perfect order. The advantage of this isthat he is enabled to make use of Don Quixote as a mouthpiece for his ownreflections, and so, without seeming to digress, allow himself the reliefof digression when he requires it, as freely as in a commonplace book.</p><p>It is true the amount of individuality bestowed upon Don Quixote is notvery great. There are some natural touches of character about him, such ashis mixture of irascibility and placability, and his curious affection forSancho together with his impatience of the squire&rsquo;s loquacity andimpertinence; but in the main, apart from his craze, he is little morethan a thoughtful, cultured gentleman, with instinctive good taste and agreat deal of shrewdness and originality of mind.</p><p>As to Sancho, it is plain, from the concluding words of the preface to theFirst Part, that he was a favourite with his creator even before he hadbeen taken into favour by the public. An inferior genius, taking him inhand a second time, would very likely have tried to improve him by makinghim more comical, clever, amiable, or virtuous. But Cervantes was too truean artist to spoil his work in this way. Sancho, when he reappears, is theold Sancho with the old familiar features; but with a difference; theyhave been brought out more distinctly, but at the same time with a carefulavoidance of anything like caricature; the outline has been filled inwhere filling in was necessary, and, vivified by a few touches of amaster&rsquo;s hand, Sancho stands before us as he might in a character portraitby Velazquez. He is a much more important and prominent figure in theSecond Part than in the First; indeed, it is his matchless mendacity aboutDulcinea that to a great extent supplies the action of the story.</p><p>His development in this respect is as remarkable as in any other. In theFirst Part he displays a great natural gift of lying. His lies are not ofthe highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonly indulge in;like Falstaff&rsquo;s, they resemble the father that begets them; they aresimple, homely, plump lies; plain working lies, in short. But in theservice of such a master as Don Quixote he develops rapidly, as we seewhen he comes to palm off the three country wenches as Dulcinea and herladies in waiting. It is worth noticing how, flushed by his success inthis instance, he is tempted afterwards to try a flight beyond his powersin his account of the journey on Clavileño.</p><p>In the Second Part it is the spirit rather than the incidents of thechivalry romances that is the subject of the burlesque. Enchantments ofthe sort travestied in those of Dulcinea and the Trifaldi and the cave ofMontesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances, andanother distinguishing feature is caricatured in Don Quixote&rsquo;s blindadoration of Dulcinea. In the romances of chivalry love is either a mereanimalism or a fantastic idolatry. Only a coarse-minded man would care tomake merry with the former, but to one of Cervantes&rsquo; humour the latter wasnaturally an attractive subject for ridicule. Like everything else inthese romances, it is a gross exaggeration of the real sentiment ofchivalry, but its peculiar extravagance is probably due to the influenceof those masters of hyperbole, the Provencal poets. When a troubadourprofessed his readiness to obey his lady in all things, he made itincumbent upon the next comer, if he wished to avoid the imputation oftameness and commonplace, to declare himself the slave of her will, whichthe next was compelled to cap by some still stronger declaration; and soexpressions of devotion went on rising one above the other like biddingsat an auction, and a conventional language of gallantry and theory of lovecame into being that in time permeated the literature of Southern Europe,and bore fruit, in one direction in the transcendental worship of Beatriceand Laura, and in another in the grotesque idolatry which found exponentsin writers like Feliciano de Silva. This is what Cervantes deals with inDon Quixote&rsquo;s passion for Dulcinea, and in no instance has he carried outthe burlesque more happily. By keeping Dulcinea in the background, andmaking her a vague shadowy being of whose very existence we are left indoubt, he invests Don Quixote&rsquo;s worship of her virtues and charms with anadditional extravagance, and gives still more point to the caricature ofthe sentiment and language of the romances.</p><p>One of the great merits of &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; and one of the qualities thathave secured its acceptance by all classes of readers and made it the mostcosmopolitan of books, is its simplicity. There are, of course, pointsobvious enough to a Spanish seventeenth century audience which do notimmediately strike a reader now-a-days, and Cervantes often takes it forgranted that an allusion will be generally understood which is onlyintelligible to a few. For example, on many of his readers in Spain, andmost of his readers out of it, the significance of his choice of a countryfor his hero is completely lost. It would be going too far to say that noone can thoroughly comprehend &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; without having seen La Mancha,but undoubtedly even a glimpse of La Mancha will give an insight into themeaning of Cervantes such as no commentator can give. Of all the regionsof Spain it is the last that would suggest the idea of romance. Of all thedull central plateau of the Peninsula it is the dullest tract. There issomething impressive about the grim solitudes of Estremadura; and if theplains of Leon and Old Castile are bald and dreary, they are studded withold cities renowned in history and rich in relics of the past. But thereis no redeeming feature in the Manchegan landscape; it has all thesameness of the desert without its dignity; the few towns and villagesthat break its monotony are mean and commonplace, there is nothingvenerable about them, they have not even the picturesqueness of poverty;indeed, Don Quixote&rsquo;s own village, Argamasilla, has a sort of oppressiverespectability in the prim regularity of its streets and houses;everything is ignoble; the very windmills are the ugliest and shabbiest ofthe windmill kind.</p><p>To anyone who knew the country well, the mere style and title of &ldquo;DonQuixote of La Mancha&rdquo; gave the key to the author&rsquo;s meaning at once. LaMancha as the knight&rsquo;s country and scene of his chivalries is of a piecewith the pasteboard helmet, the farm-labourer on ass-back for a squire,knighthood conferred by a rascally ventero, convicts taken for victims ofoppression, and the rest of the incongruities between Don Quixote&rsquo;s worldand the world he lived in, between things as he saw them and things asthey were.</p><p>It is strange that this element of incongruity, underlying the wholehumour and purpose of the book, should have been so little heeded by themajority of those who have undertaken to interpret &ldquo;Don Quixote.&rdquo; It hasbeen completely overlooked, for example, by the illustrators. To be sure,the great majority of the artists who illustrated &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; knewnothing whatever of Spain. To them a venta conveyed no idea but theabstract one of a roadside inn, and they could not therefore do fulljustice to the humour of Don Quixote&rsquo;s misconception in taking it for acastle, or perceive the remoteness of all its realities from his ideal.But even when better informed they seem to have no apprehension of thefull force of the discrepancy. Take, for instance, Gustave Doré&rsquo;s drawingof Don Quixote watching his armour in the inn-yard. Whether or not theVenta de Quesada on the Seville road is, as tradition maintains, the inndescribed in &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; beyond all question it was just such aninn-yard as the one behind it that Cervantes had in his mind&rsquo;s eye, and itwas on just such a rude stone trough as that beside the primitivedraw-well in the corner that he meant Don Quixote to deposit his armour.Gustave Doré makes it an elaborate fountain such as no arriero everwatered his mules at in the corral of any venta in Spain, and therebyentirely misses the point aimed at by Cervantes. It is the mean, prosaic,commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that givesa significance to Don Quixote&rsquo;s vigil and the ceremony that follows.</p><p>Cervantes&rsquo; humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort,the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is theincongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the ideasand aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and truthto nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous creation inthe whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which Cervantes wasthe first great master, &ldquo;Cervantes&rsquo; serious air,&rdquo; which sits naturally onSwift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential to this kind ofhumour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the hands of hisinterpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips,could be more out of place in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than aflippant, would-be facetious style, like that of Motteux&rsquo;s version forexample, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt.It is the grave matter-of-factness of the narrative, and the apparentunconsciousness of the author that he is saying anything ludicrous,anything but the merest commonplace, that give its peculiar flavour to thehumour of Cervantes. His, in fact, is the exact opposite of the humour ofSterne and the self-conscious humourists. Even when Uncle Toby is at hisbest, you are always aware of &ldquo;the man Sterne&rdquo; behind him, watching youover his shoulder to see what effect he is producing. Cervantes alwaysleaves you alone with Don Quixote and Sancho. He and Swift and the greathumourists always keep themselves out of sight, or, more properlyspeaking, never think about themselves at all, unlike our latter-dayschool of humourists, who seem to have revived the old horse-collarmethod, and try to raise a laugh by some grotesque assumption ofignorance, imbecility, or bad taste.</p><p>It is true that to do full justice to Spanish humour in any other languageis well-nigh an impossibility. There is a natural gravity and a sonorousstateliness about Spanish, be it ever so colloquial, that make anabsurdity doubly absurd, and give plausibility to the most preposterousstatement. This is what makes Sancho Panza&rsquo;s drollery the despair of theconscientious translator. Sancho&rsquo;s curt comments can never fall flat, butthey lose half their flavour when transferred from their native Castilianinto any other medium. But if foreigners have failed to do justice to thehumour of Cervantes, they are no worse than his own countrymen. Indeed,were it not for the Spanish peasant&rsquo;s relish of &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; one mightbe tempted to think that the great humourist was not looked upon as ahumourist at all in his own country.</p><p>The craze of Don Quixote seems, in some instances, to have communicateditself to his critics, making them see things that are not in the book andrun full tilt at phantoms that have no existence save in their ownimaginations. Like a good many critics now-a-days, they forget thatscreams are not criticism, and that it is only vulgar tastes that areinfluenced by strings of superlatives, three-piled hyperboles, and pompousepithets. But what strikes one as particularly strange is that while theydeal in extravagant eulogies, and ascribe all manner of imaginary ideasand qualities to Cervantes, they show no perception of the quality thatninety-nine out of a hundred of his readers would rate highest in him, andhold to be the one that raises him above all rivalry.</p><p>To speak of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; as if it were merely a humorous book would be amanifest misdescription. Cervantes at times makes it a kind of commonplacebook for occasional essays and criticisms, or for the observations andreflections and gathered wisdom of a long and stirring life. It is a mineof shrewd observation on mankind and human nature. Among modern novelsthere may be, here and there, more elaborate studies of character, butthere is no book richer in individualised character. What Coleridge saidof Shakespeare in minimis is true of Cervantes; he never, even for themost temporary purpose, puts forward a lay figure. There is life andindividuality in all his characters, however little they may have to do,or however short a time they may be before the reader. Samson Carrasco,the curate, Teresa Panza, Altisidora, even the two students met on theroad to the cave of Montesinos, all live and move and have their being;and it is characteristic of the broad humanity of Cervantes that there isnot a hateful one among them all. Even poor Maritornes, with herdeplorable morals, has a kind heart of her own and &ldquo;some faint and distantresemblance to a Christian about her;&rdquo; and as for Sancho, though ondissection we fail to find a lovable trait in him, unless it be a sort ofdog-like affection for his master, who is there that in his heart does notlove him?</p><p>But it is, after all, the humour of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; that distinguishes itfrom all other books of the romance kind. It is this that makes it, as oneof the most judicial-minded of modern critics calls it, &ldquo;the best novel inthe world beyond all comparison.&rdquo; It is its varied humour, ranging frombroad farce to comedy as subtle as Shakespeare&rsquo;s or Molière&rsquo;s that hasnaturalised it in every country where there are readers, and made it aclassic in every language that has a literature.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="pref05"></a>THE AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</h3><p>Idle reader: thou mayest believe me without any oath that I would thisbook, as it is the child of my brain, were the fairest, gayest, andcleverest that could be imagined. But I could not counteract Nature&rsquo;s lawthat everything shall beget its like; and what, then, could this sterile,illtilled wit of mine beget but the story of a dry, shrivelled, whimsicaloffspring, full of thoughts of all sorts and such as never came into anyother imagination&mdash;just what might be begotten in a prison, whereevery misery is lodged and every doleful sound makes its dwelling?Tranquillity, a cheerful retreat, pleasant fields, bright skies, murmuringbrooks, peace of mind, these are the things that go far to make even themost barren muses fertile, and bring into the world births that fill itwith wonder and delight. Sometimes when a father has an ugly, loutish son,the love he bears him so blindfolds his eyes that he does not see hisdefects, or, rather, takes them for gifts and charms of mind and body, andtalks of them to his friends as wit and grace. I, however&mdash;for thoughI pass for the father, I am but the stepfather to &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo;&mdash;haveno desire to go with the current of custom, or to implore thee, dearestreader, almost with tears in my eyes, as others do, to pardon or excusethe defects thou wilt perceive in this child of mine. Thou art neither itskinsman nor its friend, thy soul is thine own and thy will as free as anyman&rsquo;s, whate&rsquo;er he be, thou art in thine own house and master of it asmuch as the king of his taxes and thou knowest the common saying, &ldquo;Undermy cloak I kill the king;&rdquo; all which exempts and frees thee from everyconsideration and obligation, and thou canst say what thou wilt of thestory without fear of being abused for any ill or rewarded for any goodthou mayest say of it.</p><p>My wish would be simply to present it to thee plain and unadorned, withoutany embellishment of preface or uncountable muster of customary sonnets,epigrams, and eulogies, such as are commonly put at the beginning ofbooks. For I can tell thee, though composing it cost me some labour, Ifound none greater than the making of this Preface thou art now reading.Many times did I take up my pen to write it, and many did I lay it downagain, not knowing what to write. One of these times, as I was ponderingwith the paper before me, a pen in my ear, my elbow on the desk, and mycheek in my hand, thinking of what I should say, there came inunexpectedly a certain lively, clever friend of mine, who, seeing me sodeep in thought, asked the reason; to which I, making no mystery of it,answered that I was thinking of the Preface I had to make for the story of&ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; which so troubled me that I had a mind not to make any atall, nor even publish the achievements of so noble a knight.</p><p>&ldquo;For, how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what that ancientlawgiver they call the Public will say when it sees me, after slumberingso many years in the silence of oblivion, coming out now with all my yearsupon my back, and with a book as dry as a rush, devoid of invention,meagre in style, poor in thoughts, wholly wanting in learning and wisdom,without quotations in the margin or annotations at the end, after thefashion of other books I see, which, though all fables and profanity, areso full of maxims from Aristotle, and Plato, and the whole herd ofphilosophers, that they fill the readers with amazement and convince themthat the authors are men of learning, erudition, and eloquence. And then,when they quote the Holy Scriptures!&mdash;anyone would say they are St.Thomases or other doctors of the Church, observing as they do a decorum soingenious that in one sentence they describe a distracted lover and in thenext deliver a devout little sermon that it is a pleasure and a treat tohear and read. Of all this there will be nothing in my book, for I havenothing to quote in the margin or to note at the end, and still less do Iknow what authors I follow in it, to place them at the beginning, as alldo, under the letters A, B, C, beginning with Aristotle and ending withXenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis, though one was a slanderer and the other apainter. Also my book must do without sonnets at the beginning, at leastsonnets whose authors are dukes, marquises, counts, bishops, ladies, orfamous poets. Though if I were to ask two or three obliging friends, Iknow they would give me them, and such as the productions of those thathave the highest reputation in our Spain could not equal.</p><p>&ldquo;In short, my friend,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I am determined that Señor DonQuixote shall remain buried in the archives of his own La Mancha untilHeaven provide someone to garnish him with all those things he stands inneed of; because I find myself, through my shallowness and want oflearning, unequal to supplying them, and because I am by nature shy andcareless about hunting for authors to say what I myself can say withoutthem. Hence the cogitation and abstraction you found me in, and reasonenough, what you have heard from me.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing this, my friend, giving himself a slap on the forehead andbreaking into a hearty laugh, exclaimed, &ldquo;Before God, Brother, now am Idisabused of an error in which I have been living all this long time Ihave known you, all through which I have taken you to be shrewd andsensible in all you do; but now I see you are as far from that as theheaven is from the earth. Is it possible that things of so little momentand so easy to set right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit like yours, fitto break through and crush far greater obstacles? By my faith, this comes,not of any want of ability, but of too much indolence and too littleknowledge of life. Do you want to know if I am telling the truth? Well,then, attend to me, and you will see how, in the opening and shutting ofan eye, I sweep away all your difficulties, and supply all thosedeficiencies which you say check and discourage you from bringing beforethe world the story of your famous Don Quixote, the light and mirror ofall knight-errantry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say on,&rdquo; said I, listening to his talk; &ldquo;how do you propose to make upfor my diffidence, and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity I am in?&rdquo;</p><p>To which he made answer, &ldquo;Your first difficulty about the sonnets,epigrams, or complimentary verses which you want for the beginning, andwhich ought to be by persons of importance and rank, can be removed if youyourself take a little trouble to make them; you can afterwards baptisethem, and put any name you like to them, fathering them on Prester John ofthe Indies or the Emperor of Trebizond, who, to my knowledge, were said tohave been famous poets: and even if they were not, and any pedants orbachelors should attack you and question the fact, never care twomaravedis for that, for even if they prove a lie against you they cannotcut off the hand you wrote it with.</p><p>&ldquo;As to references in the margin to the books and authors from whom youtake the aphorisms and sayings you put into your story, it is onlycontriving to fit in nicely any sentences or scraps of Latin you mayhappen to have by heart, or at any rate that will not give you muchtrouble to look up; so as, when you speak of freedom and captivity, toinsert</p><p class="poem"><i>Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro;</i></p><p class="noindent">and then refer in the margin to Horace, or whoever said it; or, if youallude to the power of death, to come in with&mdash;</p><p class="poem"><i>Pallida mors æquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas,<br/>Regumque turres.</i></p><p class="noindent">&ldquo;If it be friendship and the love God bids us bear to our enemy, go atonce to the Holy Scriptures, which you can do with a very small amount ofresearch, and quote no less than the words of God himself: <i>Ego autem dicovobis: diligite inimicos vestros.</i> If you speak of evil thoughts, turn tothe Gospel: <i>De corde exeunt cogitationes malæ.</i> If of the fickleness offriends, there is Cato, who will give you his distich:</p><p class="poem"><i>Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos,<br/>Tempora si fuerint nubila, solus eris.</i></p><p class="noindent">&ldquo;With these and such like bits of Latin they will take you for agrammarian at all events, and that now-a-days is no small honour andprofit.</p><p>&ldquo;With regard to adding annotations at the end of the book, you may safelydo it in this way. If you mention any giant in your book contrive that itshall be the giant Goliath, and with this alone, which will cost youalmost nothing, you have a grand note, for you can put&mdash;<i>The giantGolias or Goliath was a Philistine whom the shepherd David slew by amighty stone-cast in the Terebinth valley, as is related in the Book ofKings</i>&mdash;in the chapter where you find it written.</p><p>&ldquo;Next, to prove yourself a man of erudition in polite literature andcosmography, manage that the river Tagus shall be named in your story, andthere you are at once with another famous annotation, setting forth&mdash;<i>Theriver Tagus was so called after a King of Spain: it has its source in suchand such a place and falls into the ocean, kissing the walls of the famouscity of Lisbon, and it is a common belief that it has golden sands</i>, etc.If you should have anything to do with robbers, I will give you the storyof Cacus, for I have it by heart; if with loose women, there is the Bishopof Mondonedo, who will give you the loan of Lamia, Laida, and Flora, anyreference to whom will bring you great credit; if with hard-hearted ones,Ovid will furnish you with Medea; if with witches or enchantresses, Homerhas Calypso, and Virgil Circe; if with valiant captains, Julius Cæsarhimself will lend you himself in his own &lsquo;Commentaries,&rsquo; and Plutarch willgive you a thousand Alexanders. If you should deal with love, with twoounces you may know of Tuscan you can go to Leon the Hebrew, who willsupply you to your heart&rsquo;s content; or if you should not care to go toforeign countries you have at home Fonseca&rsquo;s &lsquo;Of the Love of God,&rsquo; inwhich is condensed all that you or the most imaginative mind can want onthe subject. In short, all you have to do is to manage to quote thesenames, or refer to these stories I have mentioned, and leave it to me toinsert the annotations and quotations, and I swear by all that&rsquo;s good tofill your margins and use up four sheets at the end of the book.</p><p>&ldquo;Now let us come to those references to authors which other books have,and you want for yours. The remedy for this is very simple: You have onlyto look out for some book that quotes them all, from A to Z as you sayyourself, and then insert the very same alphabet in your book, and thoughthe imposition may be plain to see, because you have so little need toborrow from them, that is no matter; there will probably be some simpleenough to believe that you have made use of them all in this plain,artless story of yours. At any rate, if it answers no other purpose, thislong catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprising look ofauthority to your book. Besides, no one will trouble himself to verifywhether you have followed them or whether you have not, being no wayconcerned in it; especially as, if I mistake not, this book of yours hasno need of any one of those things you say it wants, for it is, frombeginning to end, an attack upon the books of chivalry, of which Aristotlenever dreamt, nor St. Basil said a word, nor Cicero had any knowledge; nordo the niceties of truth nor the observations of astrology come within therange of its fanciful vagaries; nor have geometrical measurements orrefutations of the arguments used in rhetoric anything to do with it; nordoes it mean to preach to anybody, mixing up things human and divine, asort of motley in which no Christian understanding should dress itself. Ithas only to avail itself of truth to nature in its composition, and themore perfect the imitation the better the work will be. And as this pieceof yours aims at nothing more than to destroy the authority and influencewhich books of chivalry have in the world and with the public, there is noneed for you to go a-begging for aphorisms from philosophers, preceptsfrom Holy Scripture, fables from poets, speeches from orators, or miraclesfrom saints; but merely to take care that your style and diction runmusically, pleasantly, and plainly, with clear, proper, and well-placedwords, setting forth your purpose to the best of your power, and puttingyour ideas intelligibly, without confusion or obscurity. Strive, too, thatin reading your story the melancholy may be moved to laughter, and themerry made merrier still; that the simple shall not be wearied, that thejudicious shall admire the invention, that the grave shall not despise it,nor the wise fail to praise it. Finally, keep your aim fixed on thedestruction of that ill-founded edifice of the books of chivalry, hated bysome and praised by many more; for if you succeed in this you will haveachieved no small success.&rdquo;</p><p>In profound silence I listened to what my friend said, and hisobservations made such an impression on me that, without attempting toquestion them, I admitted their soundness, and out of them I determined tomake this Preface; wherein, gentle reader, thou wilt perceive my friend&rsquo;sgood sense, my good fortune in finding such an adviser in such a time ofneed, and what thou hast gained in receiving, without addition oralteration, the story of the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, who is heldby all the inhabitants of the district of the Campo de Montiel to havebeen the chastest lover and the bravest knight that has for many yearsbeen seen in that neighbourhood. I have no desire to magnify the service Irender thee in making thee acquainted with so renowned and honoured aknight, but I do desire thy thanks for the acquaintance thou wilt makewith the famous Sancho Panza, his squire, in whom, to my thinking, I havegiven thee condensed all the squirely drolleries that are scatteredthrough the swarm of the vain books of chivalry. And so&mdash;may God givethee health, and not forget me.

An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights,scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra onSundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it wentin a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match forholidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best homespun.He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under twenty, and alad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the hack as well ashandle the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering onfifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riserand a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixada orQuesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among the authorswho write on the subject), although from reasonable conjectures it seemsplain that he was called Quexana. This, however, is of but littleimportance to our tale; it will be enough not to stray a hair&rsquo;s breadthfrom the truth in the telling of it.</p><p>You must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was atleisure (which was mostly all the year round) gave himself up to readingbooks of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirelyneglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of hisproperty; and to such a pitch did his eagerness and infatuation go that hesold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read, andbrought home as many of them as he could get. But of all there were nonehe liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva&rsquo;s composition,for their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in hissight, particularly when in his reading he came upon courtships andcartels, where he often found passages like &ldquo;<i>the reason of the unreasonwith which my reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason Imurmur at your beauty;&rdquo; or again, &ldquo;the high heavens, that of your divinitydivinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desertyour greatness deserves</i>.&rdquo; Over conceits of this sort the poor gentlemanlost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand them and wormthe meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not have made out orextracted had he come to life again for that special purpose. He was notat all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis gave and took, because itseemed to him that, great as were the surgeons who had cured him, he musthave had his face and body covered all over with seams and scars. Hecommended, however, the author&rsquo;s way of ending his book with the promiseof that interminable adventure, and many a time was he tempted to take uphis pen and finish it properly as is there proposed, which no doubt hewould have done, and made a successful piece of work of it too, had notgreater and more absorbing thoughts prevented him.</p><p>Many an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learnedman, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which had been the better knight,Palmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the villagebarber, however, used to say that neither of them came up to the Knight ofPhœbus, and that if there was any that could compare with <i>him</i> it was DonGalaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had a spirit that wasequal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight, nor lachrymose likehis brother, while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind him.In short, he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his nights fromsunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark, poring over them; andwhat with little sleep and much reading his brains got so dry that he losthis wits. His fancy grew full of what he used to read about in his books,enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves,agonies, and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so possessed hismind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read of was true,that to him no history in the world had more reality in it. He used to saythe Cid Ruy Diaz was a very good knight, but that he was not to becompared with the Knight of the Burning Sword who with one back-stroke cutin half two fierce and monstrous giants. He thought more of Bernardo delCarpio because at Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments,availing himself of the artifice of Hercules when he strangled Antæus theson of Terra in his arms. He approved highly of the giant Morgante,because, although of the giant breed which is always arrogant andill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But above all headmired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he saw him sallying forthfrom his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when beyond the seas hestole that image of Mahomet which, as his history says, was entirely ofgold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of a Ganelon he would havegiven his housekeeper, and his niece into the bargain.</p><p>In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion thatever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he fancied it wasright and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour as for theservice of his country, that he should make a knight-errant of himself,roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in quest ofadventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had read of asbeing the usual practices of knights-errant; righting every kind of wrong,and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in the issue, he wasto reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself crownedby the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so, led away bythe intense enjoyment he found in these pleasant fancies, he set himselfforthwith to put his scheme into execution.</p><p>The first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged tohis great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in a cornereaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished it asbest he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that it had noclosed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency, however, hisingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboardwhich, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one. It is true that,in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew his swordand gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an instantwhat had taken him a week to do. The ease with which he had knocked it topieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that danger he setto work again, fixing bars of iron on the inside until he was satisfiedwith its strength; and then, not caring to try any more experiments withit, he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most perfectconstruction.</p><p>He next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than areal and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that &ldquo;<i>tantum pellis etossa fuit</i>,&rdquo; surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or theBabieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name to givehim, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horsebelonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own,should be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so asto indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and whathe then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a newcharacter, he should take a new name, and that it should be adistinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and callinghe was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struck out,rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of hismemory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to histhinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hackbefore he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacksin the world.</p><p>Having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious toget one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this point,till at last he made up his mind to call himself &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; whence, ashas been already said, the authors of this veracious history have inferredthat his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, and not Quesada asothers would have it. Recollecting, however, that the valiant Amadis wasnot content to call himself curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added thename of his kingdom and country to make it famous, and called himselfAmadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to add on the name ofhis, and to style himself Don Quixote of La Mancha, whereby, heconsidered, he described accurately his origin and country, and did honourto it in taking his surname from it.</p><p>So then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, hishack christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to the conclusion thatnothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love with;for a knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit,or a body without a soul. As he said to himself, &ldquo;If, for my sins, or bymy good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common occurrencewith knights-errant, and overthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave himasunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him, will it notbe well to have someone I may send him to as a present, that he may comein and fall on his knees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissivevoice say, &lsquo;I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island ofMalindrania, vanquished in single combat by the never sufficientlyextolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to presentmyself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at yourpleasure&rsquo;?&rdquo; Oh, how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of thisspeech, especially when he had thought of someone to call his Lady! Therewas, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very good-lookingfarm-girl with whom he had been at one time in love, though, so far as isknown, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name wasAldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of Ladyof his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which should not be outof harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that of aprincess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del Toboso&mdash;shebeing of El Toboso&mdash;a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon, andsignificant, like all those he had already bestowed upon himself and thethings belonging to him.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p007b" id="p007b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p007b.jpg (61K)" src="images/p007b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF THE FIRST SALLY THE INGENIOUS DON QUIXOTE MADE FROM HOME</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p007c" id="p007c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p007c.jpg (97K)" src="images/p007c.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/p007c.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>These preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any longer theexecution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of all the worldwas losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right,grievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, and dutiesto discharge. So, without giving notice of his intention to anyone, andwithout anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning of the day(which was one of the hottest of the month of July) he donned his suit ofarmour, mounted Rocinante with his patched-up helmet on, braced hisbuckler, took his lance, and by the back door of the yard sallied forthupon the plain in the highest contentment and satisfaction at seeing withwhat ease he had made a beginning with his grand purpose. But scarcely didhe find himself upon the open plain, when a terrible thought struck him,one all but enough to make him abandon the enterprise at the very outset.It occurred to him that he had not been dubbed a knight, and thataccording to the law of chivalry he neither could nor ought to bear armsagainst any knight; and that even if he had been, still he ought, as anovice knight, to wear white armour, without a device upon the shielduntil by his prowess he had earned one. These reflections made him waverin his purpose, but his craze being stronger than any reasoning, he madeup his mind to have himself dubbed a knight by the first one he cameacross, following the example of others in the same case, as he had readin the books that brought him to this pass. As for white armour, heresolved, on the first opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter thanan ermine; and so comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that whichhis horse chose, for in this he believed lay the essence of adventures.</p><p>Thus setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking tohimself and saying, &ldquo;Who knows but that in time to come, when theveracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who writesit, when he has to set forth my first sally in the early morning, will doit after this fashion? &lsquo;Scarce had the rubicund Apollo spread o&rsquo;er theface of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his bright hair,scarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned their notes to hailwith dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of the rosy Dawn, that,deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, was appearing to mortalsat the gates and balconies of the Manchegan horizon, when the renownedknight Don Quixote of La Mancha, quitting the lazy down, mounted hiscelebrated steed Rocinante and began to traverse the ancient and famousCampo de Montiel;&rsquo;&rdquo; which in fact he was actually traversing. &ldquo;Happy theage, happy the time,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;in which shall be made known my deedsof fame, worthy to be moulded in brass, carved in marble, limned inpictures, for a memorial for ever. And thou, O sage magician, whoever thouart, to whom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this wondrous history,forget not, I entreat thee, my good Rocinante, the constant companion ofmy ways and wanderings.&rdquo; Presently he broke out again, as if he werelove-stricken in earnest, &ldquo;O Princess Dulcinea, lady of this captiveheart, a grievous wrong hast thou done me to drive me forth with scorn,and with inexorable obduracy banish me from the presence of thy beauty. Olady, deign to hold in remembrance this heart, thy vassal, that thus inanguish pines for love of thee.&rdquo;</p><p>So he went on stringing together these and other absurdities, all in the styleof those his books had taught him, imitating their language as well as hecould; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sun mounted so rapidly andwith such fervour that it was enough to melt his brains if he had any. Nearlyall day he travelled without anything remarkable happening to him, at which hewas in despair, for he was anxious to encounter someone at once upon whom totry the might of his strong arm.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p008" id="p008"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p008.jpg (289K)" src="images/p008.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/p008.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Writers there are who say the first adventure he met with was that ofPuerto Lapice; others say it was that of the windmills; but what I haveascertained on this point, and what I have found written in the annals ofLa Mancha, is that he was on the road all day, and towards nightfall hishack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry, when, looking allaround to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd&rsquo;s shanty wherehe might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants, he perceived not farout of his road an inn, which was as welcome as a star guiding him to theportals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; and quickening his pace hereached it just as night was setting in. At the door were standing twoyoung women, girls of the district as they call them, on their way toSeville with some carriers who had chanced to halt that night at the inn;and as, happen what might to our adventurer, everything he saw or imaginedseemed to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what he read of,the moment he saw the inn he pictured it to himself as a castle with itsfour turrets and pinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting thedrawbridge and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles ofthe sort. To this inn, which to him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at ashort distance from it he checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf wouldshow himself upon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give noticethat a knight was approaching the castle. But seeing that they were slowabout it, and that Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the stable, he madefor the inn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who were standingthere, and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or lovely ladiestaking their ease at the castle gate.</p><p>At this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through thestubbles collecting a drove of pigs (for, without any apology, that iswhat they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring them together, andforthwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he was expecting, the signalof some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so with prodigious satisfactionhe rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who, seeing a man of this sortapproaching in full armour and with lance and buckler, were turning indismay into the inn, when Don Quixote, guessing their fear by theirflight, raising his pasteboard visor, disclosed his dry dusty visage, andwith courteous bearing and gentle voice addressed them, &ldquo;Your ladyshipsneed not fly or fear any rudeness, for that it belongs not to the order ofknighthood which I profess to offer to anyone, much less to highbornmaidens as your appearance proclaims you to be.&rdquo; The girls were looking athim and straining their eyes to make out the features which the clumsyvisor obscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens, a thing somuch out of their line, they could not restrain their laughter, which madeDon Quixote wax indignant, and say, &ldquo;Modesty becomes the fair, andmoreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness; this, however,I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none other than to serveyou.&rdquo;</p><p>The incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalieronly increased the ladies&rsquo; laughter, and that increased his irritation,and matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had notcome out, who, being a very fat man, was a very peaceful one. He, seeingthis grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more than hissaddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at all indisposed tojoin the damsels in their manifestations of amusement; but, in truth,standing in awe of such a complicated armament, he thought it best tospeak him fairly, so he said, &ldquo;Señor Caballero, if your worship wantslodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in the inn) there is plentyof everything else here.&rdquo; Don Quixote, observing the respectful bearing ofthe Alcaide of the fortress (for so innkeeper and inn seemed in his eyes),made answer, &ldquo;Sir Castellan, for me anything will suffice, for</p><p class="poem">&lsquo;My armour is my only wear,<br/>My only rest the fray.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The host fancied he called him Castellan because he took him for a &ldquo;worthyof Castile,&rdquo; though he was in fact an Andalusian, and one from the strandof San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full of tricks as astudent or a page. &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said he,</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;&lsquo;Your bed is on the flinty rock,<br/>Your sleep to watch alway;&rsquo;</p><p class="noindent">and if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity ofsleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say for a singlenight.&rdquo; So saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for Don Quixote, whogot down with great difficulty and exertion (for he had not broken hisfast all day), and then charged the host to take great care of his horse,as he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world. Thelandlord eyed him over but did not find him as good as Don Quixote said,nor even half as good; and putting him up in the stable, he returned tosee what might be wanted by his guest, whom the damsels, who had by thistime made their peace with him, were now relieving of his armour. They hadtaken off his breastplate and backpiece, but they neither knew nor saw howto open his gorget or remove his make-shift helmet, for he had fastened itwith green ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots, required tobe cut. This, however, he would not by any means consent to, so heremained all the evening with his helmet on, the drollest and oddestfigure that can be imagined; and while they were removing his armour,taking the baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree belongingto the castle, he said to them with great sprightliness:</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Oh, never, surely, was there knight<br/>So served by hand of dame,<br/>As served was he, Don Quixote hight,<br/>When from his town he came;<br/>With maidens waiting on himself,<br/>Princesses on his hack&mdash;</p><p class="noindent">&mdash;or Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse&rsquo;s name, and DonQuixote of La Mancha is my own; for though I had no intention of declaringmyself until my achievements in your service and honour had made me known,the necessity of adapting that old ballad of Lancelot to the presentoccasion has given you the knowledge of my name altogether prematurely. Atime, however, will come for your ladyships to command and me to obey, andthen the might of my arm will show my desire to serve you.&rdquo;</p><p>The girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, had nothingto say in reply; they only asked him if he wanted anything to eat. &ldquo;Iwould gladly eat a bit of something,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for I feel itwould come very seasonably.&rdquo; The day happened to be a Friday, and in thewhole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the fish they call inCastile &ldquo;abadejo,&rdquo; in Andalusia &ldquo;bacallao,&rdquo; and in some places&ldquo;curadillo,&rdquo; and in others &ldquo;troutlet;&rdquo; so they asked him if he thought hecould eat troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him. &ldquo;If there betroutlets enough,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;they will be the same thing as atrout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eight reals in smallchange or a piece of eight; moreover, it may be that these troutlets arelike veal, which is better than beef, or kid, which is better than goat.But whatever it be let it come quickly, for the burden and pressure ofarms cannot be borne without support to the inside.&rdquo; They laid a table forhim at the door of the inn for the sake of the air, and the host broughthim a portion of ill-soaked and worse cooked stockfish, and a piece ofbread as black and mouldy as his own armour; but a laughable sight it wasto see him eating, for having his helmet on and the beaver up, he couldnot with his own hands put anything into his mouth unless someone elseplaced it there, and this service one of the ladies rendered him. But togive him anything to drink was impossible, or would have been so had notthe landlord bored a reed, and putting one end in his mouth poured thewine into him through the other; all which he bore with patience ratherthan sever the ribbons of his helmet.</p><p>While this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, as heapproached, sounded his reed pipe four or five times, and therebycompletely convinced Don Quixote that he was in some famous castle, andthat they were regaling him with music, and that the stockfish was trout,the bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and the landlord the castellanof the castle; and consequently he held that his enterprise and sally hadbeen to some purpose. But still it distressed him to think he had not beendubbed a knight, for it was plain to him he could not lawfully engage inany adventure without receiving the order of knighthood.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="e02.jpg (39K)" src="images/e02.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.<br/>WHEREIN IS RELATED THE DROLL WAY IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE HAD HIMSELF DUBBED AKNIGHT</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p009" id="p009"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p009.jpg (164K)" src="images/p009.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/p009.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Harassed by this reflection, he made haste with his scanty pothousesupper, and having finished it called the landlord, and shutting himselfinto the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, saying, &ldquo;From thisspot I rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy grants me the boon Iseek, one that will redound to your praise and the benefit of the humanrace.&rdquo; The landlord, seeing his guest at his feet and hearing a speech ofthis kind, stood staring at him in bewilderment, not knowing what to do orsay, and entreating him to rise, but all to no purpose until he had agreedto grant the boon demanded of him. &ldquo;I looked for no less, my lord, fromyour High Magnificence,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;and I have to tell you thatthe boon I have asked and your liberality has granted is that you shalldub me knight to-morrow morning, and that to-night I shall watch my armsin the chapel of this your castle; thus to-morrow, as I have said, will beaccomplished what I so much desire, enabling me lawfully to roam throughall the four quarters of the world seeking adventures on behalf of thosein distress, as is the duty of chivalry and of knights-errant like myself,whose ambition is directed to such deeds.&rdquo;</p><p>The landlord, who, as has been mentioned, was something of a wag, and hadalready some suspicion of his guest&rsquo;s want of wits, was quite convinced ofit on hearing talk of this kind from him, and to make sport for the nighthe determined to fall in with his humour. So he told him he was quiteright in pursuing the object he had in view, and that such a motive wasnatural and becoming in cavaliers as distinguished as he seemed and hisgallant bearing showed him to be; and that he himself in his younger dayshad followed the same honourable calling, roaming in quest of adventuresin various parts of the world, among others the Curing-grounds of Malaga,the Isles of Riaran, the Precinct of Seville, the Little Market ofSegovia, the Olivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the Strand ofSan Lucar, the Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and divers otherquarters, where he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and the lightnessof his fingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows, ruining maids andswindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under the notice ofalmost every tribunal and court of justice in Spain; until at last he hadretired to this castle of his, where he was living upon his property andupon that of others; and where he received all knights-errant of whateverrank or condition they might be, all for the great love he bore them andthat they might share their substance with him in return for hisbenevolence. He told him, moreover, that in this castle of his there wasno chapel in which he could watch his armour, as it had been pulled downin order to be rebuilt, but that in a case of necessity it might, he knew,be watched anywhere, and he might watch it that night in a courtyard ofthe castle, and in the morning, God willing, the requisite ceremoniesmight be performed so as to have him dubbed a knight, and so thoroughlydubbed that nobody could be more so. He asked if he had any money withhim, to which Don Quixote replied that he had not a farthing, as in thehistories of knights-errant he had never read of any of them carrying any.On this point the landlord told him he was mistaken; for, though notrecorded in the histories, because in the author&rsquo;s opinion there was noneed to mention anything so obvious and necessary as money and cleanshirts, it was not to be supposed therefore that they did not carry them,and he might regard it as certain and established that all knights-errant(about whom there were so many full and unimpeachable books) carriedwell-furnished purses in case of emergency, and likewise carried shirtsand a little box of ointment to cure the wounds they received. For inthose plains and deserts where they engaged in combat and came outwounded, it was not always that there was someone to cure them, unlessindeed they had for a friend some sage magician to succour them at once byfetching through the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial ofwater of such virtue that by tasting one drop of it they were cured oftheir hurts and wounds in an instant and left as sound as if they had notreceived any damage whatever. But in case this should not occur, theknights of old took care to see that their squires were provided withmoney and other requisites, such as lint and ointments for healingpurposes; and when it happened that knights had no squires (which wasrarely and seldom the case) they themselves carried everything in cunningsaddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse&rsquo;s croup, as if it weresomething else of more importance, because, unless for some such reason,carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably regarded amongknights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as his godson so soon tobe, he might even command him) never from that time forth to travelwithout money and the usual requirements, and he would find the advantageof them when he least expected it.</p><p>Don Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it wasarranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard at oneside of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placed it ona trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing his buckler on hisarm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to march up and downin front of the trough, and as he began his march night began to fall.</p><p>The landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze ofhis guest, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing ceremony hecontemplated. Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, they flockedto see it from a distance, and observed with what composure he sometimespaced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on his lance, gazed on his armourwithout taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and as the night closedin with a light from the moon so brilliant that it might vie with his thatlent it, everything the novice knight did was plainly seen by all.</p><p>Meanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water histeam, and it was necessary to remove Don Quixote&rsquo;s armour as it lay on thetrough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loud voice, &ldquo;Othou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay hands on the armourof the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword, have a care what thoudost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy life as the penalty ofthy rashness.&rdquo; The carrier gave no heed to these words (and he would havedone better to heed them if he had been heedful of his health), butseizing it by the straps flung the armour some distance from him. Seeingthis, Don Quixote raised his eyes to heaven, and fixing his thoughts,apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea, exclaimed, &ldquo;Aid me, lady mine, in thisthe first encounter that presents itself to this breast which thou holdestin subjection; let not thy favour and protection fail me in this firstjeopardy;&rdquo; and, with these words and others to the same purpose, droppinghis buckler he lifted his lance with both hands and with it smote such ablow on the carrier&rsquo;s head that he stretched him on the ground, so stunnedthat had he followed it up with a second there would have been no need ofa surgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up his armour and returned tohis beat with the same serenity as before.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p010" id="p010"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p010.jpg (261K)" src="images/p010.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/p010.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Shortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for thecarrier still lay senseless), came with the same object of giving water tohis mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear thetrough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid fromanyone, once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted his lance, andwithout actually breaking the second carrier&rsquo;s head into pieces, made morethan three of it, for he laid it open in four. At the noise all the peopleof the inn ran to the spot, and among them the landlord. Seeing this, DonQuixote braced his buckler on his arm, and with his hand on his swordexclaimed, &ldquo;O Lady of Beauty, strength and support of my faint heart, itis time for thee to turn the eyes of thy greatness on this thy captiveknight on the brink of so mighty an adventure.&rdquo; By this he felt himself soinspired that he would not have flinched if all the carriers in the worldhad assailed him. The comrades of the wounded perceiving the plight theywere in began from a distance to shower stones on Don Quixote, whoscreened himself as best he could with his buckler, not daring to quit thetrough and leave his armour unprotected. The landlord shouted to them toleave him alone, for he had already told them that he was mad, and as amadman he would not be accountable even if he killed them all. Stilllouder shouted Don Quixote, calling them knaves and traitors, and the lordof the castle, who allowed knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, avillain and a low-born knight whom, had he received the order ofknighthood, he would call to account for his treachery. &ldquo;But of you,&rdquo; hecried, &ldquo;base and vile rabble, I make no account; fling, strike, come on,do all ye can against me, ye shall see what the reward of your folly andinsolence will be.&rdquo; This he uttered with so much spirit and boldness thathe filled his assailants with a terrible fear, and as much for this reasonas at the persuasion of the landlord they left off stoning him, and heallowed them to carry off the wounded, and with the same calmness andcomposure as before resumed the watch over his armour.</p><p>But these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the landlord,so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him at once theunlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure could occur;so, going up to him, he apologised for the rudeness which, without hisknowledge, had been offered to him by these low people, who, however, hadbeen well punished for their audacity. As he had already told him, hesaid, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was it needed for whatremained to be done, for, as he understood the ceremonial of the order,the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in the accolade and in theslap on the shoulder, and that could be administered in the middle of afield; and that he had now done all that was needful as to watching thearmour, for all requirements were satisfied by a watch of two hours only,while he had been more than four about it. Don Quixote believed it all,and told him he stood there ready to obey him, and to make an end of itwith as much despatch as possible; for, if he were again attacked, andfelt himself to be dubbed knight, he would not, he thought, leave a soulalive in the castle, except such as out of respect he might spare at hisbidding.</p><p>Thus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book inwhich he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the carriers,and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels alreadymentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him kneeldown. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeating somedevout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand and gavehim a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a smart slapon the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth as if he wassaying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one of the ladies togird on his sword, which she did with great self-possession and gravity,and not a little was required to prevent a burst of laughter at each stageof the ceremony; but what they had already seen of the novice knight&rsquo;sprowess kept their laughter within bounds. On girding him with the swordthe worthy lady said to him, &ldquo;May God make your worship a very fortunateknight, and grant you success in battle.&rdquo; Don Quixote asked her name inorder that he might from that time forward know to whom he was beholdenfor the favour he had received, as he meant to confer upon her someportion of the honour he acquired by the might of his arm. She answeredwith great humility that she was called La Tolosa, and that she was thedaughter of a cobbler of Toledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya,and that wherever she might be she would serve and esteem him as her lord.Don Quixote said in reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforwardshe assumed the &ldquo;Don&rdquo; and called herself Doña Tolosa. She promised shewould, and then the other buckled on his spur, and with her followedalmost the same conversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked hername, and she said it was La Molinera, and that she was the daughter of arespectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don Quixote requestedthat she would adopt the &ldquo;Don&rdquo; and call herself Doña Molinera, makingoffers to her further services and favours.</p><p>Having thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion thesenever-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he sawhimself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and saddlingRocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he returnedthanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in language soextraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it.The landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no less rhetoricthough with shorter words, and without calling upon him to pay thereckoning let him go with a Godspeed.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p017" id="p017"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p017.jpg (54K)" src="images/p017.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/p017.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br/>OF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KNIGHT WHEN HE LEFT THE INN</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p018" id="p018"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p018.jpg (94K)" src="images/p018.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/p018.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Day was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, soexhilarated at finding himself now dubbed a knight, that his joy was liketo burst his horse-girths. However, recalling the advice of his host as tothe requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that referring tomoney and shirts, he determined to go home and provide himself with all,and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing a farm-labourer, aneighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but very well qualified forthe office of squire to a knight. With this object he turned his horse&rsquo;shead towards his village, and Rocinante, thus reminded of his oldquarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardly seemed to tread the earth.</p><p>He had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed tocome feeble cries as of someone in distress, and the instant he heardthem he exclaimed, &ldquo;Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me, thatit so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I haveundertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition. These cries, no doubt,come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing my aid andprotection;&rdquo; and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the direction whence thecries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces into the wood, whenhe saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and stripped from thewaist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age, from whom the criescame. Nor were they without cause, for a lusty farmer was flogging himwith a belt and following up every blow with scoldings and commands,repeating, &ldquo;Your mouth shut and your eyes open!&rdquo; while the youth madeanswer, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it again, master mine; by God&rsquo;s passion I won&rsquo;t do itagain, and I&rsquo;ll take more care of the flock another time.&rdquo;</p><p>Seeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice,&ldquo;Discourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot defendhimself; mount your steed and take your lance&rdquo; (for there was a lanceleaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), &ldquo;and I will make youknow that you are behaving as a coward.&rdquo; The farmer, seeing before himthis figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his head, gave himselfup for dead, and made answer meekly, &ldquo;Sir Knight, this youth that I amchastising is my servant, employed by me to watch a flock of sheep that Ihave hard by, and he is so careless that I lose one every day, and when Ipunish him for his carelessness and knavery he says I do it out ofniggardliness, to escape paying him the wages I owe him, and before God,and on my soul, he lies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lies before me, base clown!&rdquo; said Don Quixote. &ldquo;By the sun that shines onus I have a mind to run you through with this lance. Pay him at oncewithout another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make an endof you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p019" id="p019"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p019.jpg (339K)" src="images/p019.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/p019.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, of whomDon Quixote asked how much his master owed him.</p><p>He replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it up,found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to pay itdown immediately, if he did not want to die for it.</p><p>The trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had sworn(though he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there were to betaken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him, anda real for two blood-lettings when he was sick.</p><p>&ldquo;All that is very well,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but let the shoes and theblood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given himwithout any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paidfor, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood fromhim when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on thatscore he owes you nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andres comehome with me, and I will pay him all, real by real.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I go with him!&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;Nay, God forbid! No, señor, not for theworld; for once alone with me, he would ray me like a Saint Bartholomew.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He will do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;I have only tocommand, and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order ofknighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee thepayment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Consider what you are saying, señor,&rdquo; said the youth; &ldquo;this master ofmine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; for heis Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That matters little,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;there may be Haldudosknights; moreover, everyone is the son of his works.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Andres; &ldquo;but this master of mine&mdash;of what worksis he the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not refuse, brother Andres,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;be good enough tocome along with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood there arein the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and perfumed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For the perfumery I excuse you,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;give it to him inreals, and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn; ifnot, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and punishyou; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard. Andif you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you, that you bemore firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous Don Quixote ofLa Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so, God be with you,and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn under those penaltiesthat have been already declared to you.&rdquo;</p><p>So saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. Thefarmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared thewood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and said,&ldquo;Come here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that undoer ofwrongs has commanded me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My oath on it,&rdquo; said Andres, &ldquo;your worship will be well advised to obeythe command of that good knight&mdash;may he live a thousand years&mdash;for,as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he willcome back and do as he said.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My oath on it, too,&rdquo; said the farmer; &ldquo;but as I have a strong affectionfor you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment;&rdquo; andseizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave him such a floggingthat he left him for dead.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, Master Andres,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;call on the undoer of wrongs; youwill find he won&rsquo;t undo that, though I am not sure that I have quite donewith you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.&rdquo; But at last he untiedhim, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put thesentence pronounced into execution.</p><p>Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look forthe valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what hadhappened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for allthat, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.</p><p>Thus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughlysatisfied with what had taken place, as he considered he had made a veryhappy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the road towardshis village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice, &ldquo;Well mayestthou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth, O Dulcinea delToboso, fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thy lot to holdsubject and submissive to thy full will and pleasure a knight so renownedas is and will be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, as all the world knows,yesterday received the order of knighthood, and hath to-day righted thegreatest wrong and grievance that ever injustice conceived and crueltyperpetrated: who hath to-day plucked the rod from the hand of yonderruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing that tender child.&rdquo;</p><p>He now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he wasreminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop toconsider which road they should take. In imitation of them he halted for awhile, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante his head,submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed out his firstintention, which was to make straight for his own stable. After he hadgone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large party of people, who,as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, on their way to buy silkat Murcia. There were six of them coming along under their sunshades, withfour servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot. Scarcely had DonQuixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that this must be somenew adventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he could thosepassages he had read of in his books, here seemed to come one made onpurpose, which he resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing anddetermination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his lanceready, brought his buckler before his breast, and planting himself in themiddle of the road, stood waiting the approach of these knights-errant,for such he now considered and held them to be; and when they had comenear enough to see and hear, he exclaimed with a haughty gesture, &ldquo;All theworld stand, unless all the world confess that in all the world there isno maiden fairer than the Empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea delToboso.&rdquo;</p><p>The traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of thestrange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and language at onceguessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn quietlywhat was the object of this confession that was demanded of them, and oneof them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very sharp-witted, said tohim, &ldquo;Sir Knight, we do not know who this good lady is that you speak of;show her to us, for, if she be of such beauty as you suggest, with all ourhearts and without any pressure we will confess the truth that is on yourpart required of us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I were to show her to you,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;what merit would youhave in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is thatwithout seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defendit; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant rabblethat ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order of knighthoodrequires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of your breed,here do I bide and await you relying on the justice of the cause Imaintain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir Knight,&rdquo; replied the trader, &ldquo;I entreat your worship in the name ofthis present company of princes, that, to save us from charging ourconsciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard of,and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and Queens ofthe Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to show us someportrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain of wheat; forby the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we shall be satisfiedand easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay, I believe we arealready so far agreed with you that even though her portrait should showher blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and sulphur from the other,we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship, say all in her favour thatyou desire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, burningwith rage, &ldquo;nothing of the kind, I say, only ambergris and civet incotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than aGuadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have utteredagainst beauty like that of my lady.&rdquo;</p><p>And so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who hadspoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrived thatRocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone hardwith the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went his master,rolling along the ground for some distance; and when he tried to rise hewas unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs, helmet, andthe weight of his old armour; and all the while he was struggling to getup he kept saying, &ldquo;Fly not, cowards and caitiffs! stay, for not by myfault, but my horse&rsquo;s, am I stretched here.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p020" id="p020"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p020.jpg (352K)" src="images/p020.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/p020.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>One of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much good nature inhim, hearing the poor prostrate man blustering in this style, was unable torefrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and coming up to him he seizedhis lance, and having broken it in pieces, with one of them he began so tobelabour our Don Quixote that, notwithstanding and in spite of his armour, hemilled him like a measure of wheat. His masters called out not to lay on sohard and to leave him alone, but the muleteer&rsquo;s blood was up, and he didnot care to drop the game until he had vented the rest of his wrath, andgathering up the remaining fragments of the lance he finished with a dischargeupon the unhappy victim, who all through the storm of sticks that rained on himnever ceased threatening heaven, and earth, and the brigands, for such theyseemed to him. At last the muleteer was tired, and the traders continued theirjourney, taking with them matter for talk about the poor fellow who had beencudgelled. He when he found himself alone made another effort to rise; but ifhe was unable when whole and sound, how was he to rise after having beenthrashed and well-nigh knocked to pieces? And yet he esteemed himselffortunate, as it seemed to him that this was a regular knight-errant&rsquo;smishap, and entirely, he considered, the fault of his horse. However, batteredin body as he was, to rise was beyond his power.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="e04" id="e04"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="e04.jpg (28K)" src="images/e04.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.<br/>IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE OF OUR KNIGHT&rsquo;S MISHAP IS CONTINUED</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p022" id="p022"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p022.jpg (123K)" src="images/p022.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/p022.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Finding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought himself ofhaving recourse to his usual remedy, which was to think of some passage inhis books, and his craze brought to his mind that about Baldwin and theMarquis of Mantua, when Carloto left him wounded on the mountainside, astory known by heart by the children, not forgotten by the young men, andlauded and even believed by the old folk; and for all that not a whittruer than the miracles of Mahomet. This seemed to him to fit exactly thecase in which he found himself, so, making a show of severe suffering, hebegan to roll on the ground and with feeble breath repeat the very wordswhich the wounded knight of the wood is said to have uttered:</p><p class="poem">Where art thou, lady mine, that thou<br/>My sorrow dost not rue?<br/>Thou canst not know it, lady mine,<br/>Or else thou art untrue.</p><p>And so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:</p><p class="poem">O noble Marquis of Mantua,<br/>My Uncle and liege lord!</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p026" id="p026"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p026.jpg (316K)" src="images/p026.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/p026.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>As chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened tocome by a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who had beenwith a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched there,came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter with himthat he complained so dolefully.</p><p>Don Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua, hisuncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in whichhe told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the Emperor&rsquo;s sonand his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.</p><p>The peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him ofthe visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face, whichwas covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he recognised him andsaid, &ldquo;Señor Quixada&rdquo; (for so he appears to have been called when he wasin his senses and had not yet changed from a quiet country gentleman intoa knight-errant), &ldquo;who has brought your worship to this pass?&rdquo; But to allquestions the other only went on with his ballad.</p><p>Seeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate andbackpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no blood norany mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from the ground, andwith no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which seemed to him tobe the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms, even to thesplinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, and leading him by thebridle and the ass by the halter he took the road for the village, verysad to hear what absurd stuff Don Quixote was talking.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p029" id="p029"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p029.jpg (285K)" src="images/p029.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/p029.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Nor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could notsit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs to heaven,so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him. And it couldhave been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to match hisown adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, he bethought himself of theMoor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide of Antequera, Rodrigo de Narvaez, tookhim prisoner and carried him away to his castle; so that when the peasantagain asked him how he was and what ailed him, he gave him for reply thesame words and phrases that the captive Abindarraez gave to Rodrigo deNarvaez, just as he had read the story in the &ldquo;Diana&rdquo; of Jorge deMontemayor where it is written, applying it to his own case so aptly thatthe peasant went along cursing his fate that he had to listen to such alot of nonsense; from which, however, he came to the conclusion that hisneighbour was mad, and so made all haste to reach the village to escapethe wearisomeness of this harangue of Don Quixote&rsquo;s; who, at the end ofit, said, &ldquo;Señor Don Rodrigo de Narvaez, your worship must know that thisfair Xarifa I have mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, forwhom I have done, am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalrythat in this world have been seen, are to be seen, or ever shall be seen.&rdquo;</p><p>To this the peasant answered, &ldquo;Señor&mdash;sinner that I am!&mdash;cannotyour worship see that I am not Don Rodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis ofMantua, but Pedro Alonso your neighbour, and that your worship is neitherBaldwin nor Abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman Señor Quixada?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know who I am,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;and I know that I may be not onlythose I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and even all theNine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have done alltogether and each of them on his own account.&rdquo;</p><p>With this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just asnight was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was a littlelater that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in such amiserable trim. When it was what seemed to him the proper time he enteredthe village and went to Don Quixote&rsquo;s house, which he found all inconfusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, who weregreat friends of Don Quixote, and his housekeeper was saying to them in aloud voice, &ldquo;What does your worship think can have befallen my master,Señor Licentiate Pero Perez?&rdquo; for so the curate was called; &ldquo;it is threedays now since anything has been seen of him, or the hack, or the buckler,lance, or armour. Miserable me! I am certain of it, and it is as true asthat I was born to die, that these accursed books of chivalry he has, andhas got into the way of reading so constantly, have upset his reason; fornow I remember having often heard him saying to himself that he would turnknight-errant and go all over the world in quest of adventures. To thedevil and Barabbas with such books, that have brought to ruin in this waythe finest understanding there was in all La Mancha!&rdquo;</p><p>The niece said the same, and, more: &ldquo;You must know, Master Nicholas&rdquo;&mdash;forthat was the name of the barber&mdash;&ldquo;it was often my uncle&rsquo;s way to staytwo days and nights together poring over these unholy books ofmisventures, after which he would fling the book away and snatch up hissword and fall to slashing the walls; and when he was tired out he wouldsay he had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweat that flowedfrom him when he was weary he said was the blood of the wounds he hadreceived in battle; and then he would drink a great jug of cold water andbecome calm and quiet, saying that this water was a most precious potionwhich the sage Esquife, a great magician and friend of his, had broughthim. But I take all the blame upon myself for never having told yourworships of my uncle&rsquo;s vagaries, that you might put a stop to them beforethings had come to this pass, and burn all these accursed books&mdash;forhe has a great number&mdash;that richly deserve to be burned likeheretics.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So say I too,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;and by my faith to-morrow shall not passwithout public judgment upon them, and may they be condemned to the flameslest they lead those that read to behave as my good friend seems to havebehaved.&rdquo;</p><p>All this the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what was thematter with his neighbour, so he began calling aloud, &ldquo;Open, yourworships, to Señor Baldwin and to Señor the Marquis of Mantua, who comesbadly wounded, and to Señor Abindarraez, the Moor, whom the valiantRodrigo de Narvaez, the Alcaide of Antequera, brings captive.&rdquo;</p><p>At these words they all hurried out, and when they recognised theirfriend, master, and uncle, who had not yet dismounted from the ass becausehe could not, they ran to embrace him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for I am badly wounded through my horse&rsquo;s fault; carryme to bed, and if possible send for the wise Urganda to cure and see to mywounds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;See there! plague on it!&rdquo; cried the housekeeper at this: &ldquo;did not myheart tell the truth as to which foot my master went lame of? To bed withyour worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you here withoutfetching that Hurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundred times more,on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship to such a pass.&rdquo;</p><p>They carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds couldfind none, but he said they were all bruises from having had a severe fallwith his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants, the biggest andthe boldest to be found on earth.</p><p>&ldquo;So, so!&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;are there giants in the dance? By the sign ofthe Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day is over.&rdquo;</p><p>They put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to allwas&mdash;give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that waswhat he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant atgreat length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and thenonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which made thelicentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day, which was tosummon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with him to DonQuixote&rsquo;s house.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p031" id="p031"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p031.jpg (31K)" src="images/p031.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br/>OF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBERMADE IN THE LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c06a" id="c06a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c06a.jpg (92K)" src="images/c06a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c06a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>He was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of theroom where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, and rightwillingly she gave them.

Take it, mistress housekeeper; open thewindow and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the pile forthe bonfire we are to make.&rdquo;</p><p>The housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, and the worthy&ldquo;Esplandian&rdquo; went flying into the yard to await with all patience the firethat was in store for him.</p><p>&ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; said the curate.</p><p>&ldquo;This that comes next,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;is &lsquo;Amadis of Greece,&rsquo; and,indeed, I believe all those on this side are of the same Amadis lineage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then to the yard with the whole of them,&rdquo; said the curate; &ldquo;for to havethe burning of Queen Pintiquiniestra, and the shepherd Darinel and hiseclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author, Iwould burn with them the father who begot me if he were going about in theguise of a knight-errant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am of the same mind,&rdquo; said the barber.</p><p>&ldquo;And so am I,&rdquo; added the niece.</p><p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the housekeeper, &ldquo;here, into the yard with them!&rdquo;</p><p>They were handed to her, and as there were many of them, she sparedherself the staircase, and flung them down out of the window.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is that tub there?&rdquo; said the curate.</p><p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;is &lsquo;Don Olivante de Laura.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The author of that book,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;was the same that wrote &lsquo;TheGarden of Flowers,&rsquo; and truly there is no deciding which of the two booksis the more truthful, or, to put it better, the less lying; all I can sayis, send this one into the yard for a swaggering fool.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This that follows is &lsquo;Florismarte of Hircania,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the barber.</p><p>&ldquo;Señor Florismarte here?&rdquo; said the curate; &ldquo;then by my faith he must takeup his quarters in the yard, in spite of his marvellous birth andvisionary adventures, for the stiffness and dryness of his style deservenothing else; into the yard with him and the other, mistress housekeeper.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With all my heart, señor,&rdquo; said she, and executed the order with greatdelight.</p><p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;is &lsquo;The Knight Platir.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;An old book that,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;but I find no reason for clemency init; send it after the others without appeal;&rdquo; which was done.</p><p>Another book was opened, and they saw it was entitled, &ldquo;The Knight of theCross.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For the sake of the holy name this book has,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;itsignorance might be excused; but then, they say, &lsquo;behind the cross there&rsquo;sthe devil;&rsquo; to the fire with it.&rdquo;</p><p>Taking down another book, the barber said, &ldquo;This is &lsquo;The Mirror ofChivalry.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know his worship,&rdquo; said the curate; &ldquo;that is where Señor Reinaldos ofMontalvan figures with his friends and comrades, greater thieves thanCacus, and the Twelve Peers of France with the veracious historian Turpin;however, I am not for condemning them to more than perpetual banishment,because, at any rate, they have some share in the invention of the famousMatteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet Ludovico Ariosto wove hisweb, to whom, if I find him here, and speaking any language but his own, Ishall show no respect whatever; but if he speaks his own tongue I will puthim upon my head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I have him in Italian,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;but I do not understandhim.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nor would it be well that you should understand him,&rdquo; said the curate,&ldquo;and on that score we might have excused the Captain if he had not broughthim into Spain and turned him into Castilian. He robbed him of a greatdeal of his natural force, and so do all those who try to turn bookswritten in verse into another language, for, with all the pains they takeand all the cleverness they show, they never can reach the level of theoriginals as they were first produced. In short, I say that this book, andall that may be found treating of those French affairs, should be throwninto or deposited in some dry well, until after more consideration it issettled what is to be done with them; excepting always one &lsquo;Bernardo delCarpio&rsquo; that is going about, and another called &lsquo;Roncesvalles;&rsquo; for these,if they come into my hands, shall pass at once into those of thehousekeeper, and from hers into the fire without any reprieve.&rdquo;</p><p>To all this the barber gave his assent, and looked upon it as right andproper, being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the Faith andloyal to the Truth that he would not for the world say anything opposed tothem. Opening another book he saw it was &ldquo;Palmerin de Oliva,&rdquo; and besideit was another called &ldquo;Palmerin of England,&rdquo; seeing which the licentiatesaid, &ldquo;Let the Olive be made firewood of at once and burned until no asheseven are left; and let that Palm of England be kept and preserved as athing that stands alone, and let such another case be made for it as thatwhich Alexander found among the spoils of Darius and set aside for thesafe keeping of the works of the poet Homer. This book, gossip, is ofauthority for two reasons, first because it is very good, and secondlybecause it is said to have been written by a wise and witty king ofPortugal. All the adventures at the Castle of Miraguarda are excellent andof admirable contrivance, and the language is polished and clear, studyingand observing the style befitting the speaker with propriety and judgment.So then, provided it seems good to you, Master Nicholas, I say let thisand &lsquo;Amadis of Gaul&rsquo; be remitted the penalty of fire, and as for all therest, let them perish without further question or query.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nay, gossip,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;for this that I have here is the famous&lsquo;Don Belianis.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;that and the second, third, and fourth parts allstand in need of a little rhubarb to purge their excess of bile, and theymust be cleared of all that stuff about the Castle of Fame and othergreater affectations, to which end let them be allowed the over-seas term,and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or justice be meted out tothem; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them in your house and letno one read them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said the barber; and not caring to tire himself withreading more books of chivalry, he told the housekeeper to take all thebig ones and throw them into the yard. It was not said to one dull ordeaf, but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the broadestand finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at a time, she flungthem out of the window.</p><p>In carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the barber,who took it up, curious to know whose it was, and found it said, &ldquo;Historyof the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God bless me!&rdquo; said the curate with a shout, &ldquo;&lsquo;Tirante el Blanco&rsquo; here!Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have found a treasury ofenjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison of Montalvan,a valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, and the knightFonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with the mastiff, and thewitticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the loves and wiles of thewidow Reposada, and the empress in love with the squire Hipolito&mdash;intruth, gossip, by right of its style it is the best book in the world.Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds, and make their willsbefore dying, and a great deal more of which there is nothing in all theother books. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it, for deliberatelycomposing such fooleries, deserves to be sent to the galleys for life.Take it home with you and read it, and you will see that what I have saidis true.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As you will,&rdquo; said the barber; &ldquo;but what are we to do with these littlebooks that are left?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;These must be, not chivalry, but poetry,&rdquo; said the curate; and openingone he saw it was the &ldquo;Diana&rdquo; of Jorge de Montemayor, and, supposing allthe others to be of the same sort, &ldquo;these,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do not deserve to beburned like the others, for they neither do nor can do the mischief thebooks of chivalry have done, being books of entertainment that can hurt noone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, señor!&rdquo; said the niece, &ldquo;your worship had better order these to beburned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if, after beingcured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a fancyto turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and piping; or,what would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say is an incurableand infectious malady.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The damsel is right,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;and it will be well to put thisstumbling-block and temptation out of our friend&rsquo;s way. To begin, then,with the &lsquo;Diana&rsquo; of Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not be burned,but that it should be cleared of all that about the sage Felicia and themagic water, and of almost all the longer pieces of verse: let it keep,and welcome, its prose and the honour of being the first of books of thekind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This that comes next,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;is the &lsquo;Diana,&rsquo; entitled the&lsquo;Second Part, by the Salamancan,&rsquo; and this other has the same title, andits author is Gil Polo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As for that of the Salamancan,&rdquo; replied the curate, &ldquo;let it go to swellthe number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo&rsquo;s be preservedas if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, and make haste, forit is growing late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This book,&rdquo; said the barber, opening another, &ldquo;is the ten books of the&lsquo;Fortune of Love,&rsquo; written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By the orders I have received,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;since Apollo has beenApollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets, so drolland absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its way it is thebest and the most singular of all of this species that have as yetappeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he has never read what isdelightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make more account of having foundit than if they had given me a cassock of Florence stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>He put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on, &ldquo;Thesethat come next are &lsquo;The Shepherd of Iberia,&rsquo; &lsquo;Nymphs of Henares,&rsquo; and &lsquo;TheEnlightenment of Jealousy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then all we have to do,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;is to hand them over to thesecular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall never havedone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This next is the &lsquo;Pastor de Fílida.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No Pastor that,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;but a highly polished courtier; let itbe preserved as a precious jewel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This large one here,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;is called &lsquo;The Treasury ofvarious Poems.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If there were not so many of them,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;they would be morerelished: this book must be weeded and cleansed of certain vulgaritieswhich it has with its excellences; let it be preserved because the authoris a friend of mine, and out of respect for other more heroic and loftierworks that he has written.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; continued the barber, &ldquo;is the &lsquo;Cancionero&rsquo; of Lopez de Maldonado.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The author of that book, too,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;is a great friend ofmine, and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all who hearthem, for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when hechants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what is goodwas never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have been setapart. But what book is that next it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Galatea&rsquo; of Miguel de Cervantes,&rdquo; said the barber.</p><p>&ldquo;That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to myknowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. His bookhas some good invention in it, it presents us with something but bringsnothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it promises:perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full measure of gracethat is now denied it; and in the mean time do you, señor gossip, keep itshut up in your own quarters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the barber; &ldquo;and here come three together, the&lsquo;Araucana&rsquo; of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the &lsquo;Austriada&rsquo; of Juan Rufo, Justiceof Cordova, and the &lsquo;Montserrate&rsquo; of Christobal de Virués, the Valencianpoet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;These three books,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;are the best that have been writtenin Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with the most famous ofItaly; let them be preserved as the richest treasures of poetry that Spainpossesses.&rdquo;</p><p>The curate was tired and would not look into any more books, and so hedecided that, &ldquo;contents uncertified,&rdquo; all the rest should be burned; butjust then the barber held open one, called &ldquo;The Tears of Angelica.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should have shed tears myself,&rdquo; said the curate when he heard thetitle, &ldquo;had I ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one ofthe famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happy inthe translation of some of Ovid&rsquo;s fables.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c06e" id="c06e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c06e.jpg (30K)" src="images/c06e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br/>OF THE SECOND SALLY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c07a" id="c07a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c07a.jpg (151K)" src="images/c07a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c07a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>At this instant Don Quixote began shouting out, &ldquo;Here, here, valiantknights! here is need for you to put forth the might of your strong arms,for they of the Court are gaining the mastery in the tourney!&rdquo; Called awayby this noise and outcry, they proceeded no farther with the scrutiny ofthe remaining books, and so it is thought that &ldquo;The Carolea,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lion ofSpain,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Deeds of the Emperor,&rdquo; written by Don Luis de Ávila, wentto the fire unseen and unheard; for no doubt they were among those thatremained, and perhaps if the curate had seen them they would not haveundergone so severe a sentence.</p><p>When they reached Don Quixote he was already out of bed, and was stillshouting and raving, and slashing and cutting all round, as wide awake asif he had never slept.</p><p>They closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he hadbecome a little calm, addressing the curate, he said to him, &ldquo;Of a truth,Señor Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call ourselvesthe Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the Court to gainthe victory in this tourney, we the adventurers having carried off thehonour on the three former days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hush, gossip,&rdquo; said the curate; &ldquo;please God, the luck may turn, and whatis lost to-day may be won to-morrow; for the present let your worship havea care of your health, for it seems to me that you are over-fatigued, ifnot badly wounded.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wounded no,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;but bruised and battered no doubt, forthat bastard Don Roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree,and all for envy, because he sees that I alone rival him in hisachievements. But I should not call myself Reinaldos of Montalvan did henot pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as I rise fromthis bed.

Two days later Don Quixote got up, and the first thing he didwas to go and look at his books, and not finding the room where he hadleft it, he wandered from side to side looking for it. He came to theplace where the door used to be, and tried it with his hands, and turnedand twisted his eyes in every direction without saying a word; but after agood while he asked his housekeeper whereabouts was the room that held hisbooks.</p><p>The housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she was toanswer, said, &ldquo;What room or what nothing is it that your worship islooking for? There are neither room nor books in this house now, for thedevil himself has carried all away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was not the devil,&rdquo; said the niece, &ldquo;but a magician who came on acloud one night after the day your worship left this, and dismounting froma serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did there I knownot, but after a little while he made off, flying through the roof, andleft the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he had done wesaw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the housekeeper andI, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud voice that, for aprivate grudge he owed the owner of the books and the room, he had donemischief in that house that would be discovered by-and-by: he said toothat his name was the Sage Muñaton.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He must have said Friston,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether he called himself Friston or Friton,&rdquo; said thehousekeeper, &ldquo;I only know that his name ended with &lsquo;ton.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it does,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and he is a sage magician, a great enemyof mine, who has a spite against me because he knows by his arts and lorethat in process of time I am to engage in single combat with a knight whomhe befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will be unable to preventit; and for this reason he endeavours to do me all the ill turns that hecan; but I promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid what isdecreed by Heaven.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who doubts that?&rdquo; said the niece; &ldquo;but, uncle, who mixes you up in thesequarrels? Would it not be better to remain at peace in your own houseinstead of roaming the world looking for better bread than ever came ofwheat, never reflecting that many go for wool and come back shorn?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, niece of mine,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;how much astray art thou in thyreckoning: ere they shear me I shall have plucked away and stripped offthe beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine.&rdquo;</p><p>The two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that hisanger was kindling.</p><p>In short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly withoutshowing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions, andduring this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, thecurate and the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errantwere what the world stood most in need of, and that in him was to beaccomplished the revival of knight-errantry. The curate sometimescontradicted him, sometimes agreed with him, for if he had not observedthis precaution he would have been unable to bring him to reason.</p><p>Meanwhile Don Quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his, anhonest man (if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor), butwith very little wit in his pate. In a word, he so talked him over, andwith such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his mindto sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. Don Quixote, among otherthings, told him he ought to be ready to go with him gladly, because anymoment an adventure might occur that might win an island in the twinklingof an eye and leave him governor of it. On these and the like promisesSancho Panza (for so the labourer was called) left wife and children, andengaged himself as esquire to his neighbour.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c07b" id="c07b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c07b.jpg (322K)" src="images/c07b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c07b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing andpawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he got together afair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which he begged as a loanfrom a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as best he could, hewarned his squire Sancho of the day and hour he meant to set out, that hemight provide himself with what he thought most needful. Above all, hecharged him to take alforjas with him. The other said he would, and thathe meant to take also a very good ass he had, as he was not much given togoing on foot. About the ass, Don Quixote hesitated a little, tryingwhether he could call to mind any knight-errant taking with him an esquiremounted on ass-back, but no instance occurred to his memory. For all that,however, he determined to take him, intending to furnish him with a morehonourable mount when a chance of it presented itself, by appropriatingthe horse of the first discourteous knight he encountered. Himself heprovided with shirts and such other things as he could, according to theadvice the host had given him; all which being done, without taking leave,Sancho Panza of his wife and children, or Don Quixote of his housekeeperand niece, they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village onenight, and made such good way in the course of it that by daylight theyheld themselves safe from discovery, even should search be made for them.</p><p>Sancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota, andlonging to see himself soon governor of the island his master had promisedhim. Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and road he had takenon his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel, which he travelledwith less discomfort than on the last occasion, for, as it was earlymorning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely, the heat did notdistress them.</p><p>And now said Sancho Panza to his master, &ldquo;Your worship will take care,Señor Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised me,for be it ever so big I&rsquo;ll be equal to governing it.&rdquo;</p><p>To which Don Quixote replied, &ldquo;Thou must know, friend Sancho Panza, thatit was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of old tomake their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they won, and I amdetermined that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal acustom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon it, for they sometimes,and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires were old, and thenwhen they had had enough of service and hard days and worse nights, theygave them some title or other, of count, or at the most marquis, of somevalley or province more or less; but if thou livest and I live, it maywell be that before six days are over, I may have won some kingdom thathas others dependent upon it, which will be just the thing to enable theeto be crowned king of one of them. Nor needst thou count this wonderful,for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways sounexampled and unexpected that I might easily give thee even more than Ipromise thee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Sancho Panza, &ldquo;if I should become a king by one ofthose miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old woman,would come to be queen and my children infantes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, who doubts it?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; replied Sancho Panza, &ldquo;because for my part I am persuadedthat though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of themwould fit the head of Mari Gutierrez.

For all that, hewas much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire, headded, &ldquo;I remember having read how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez de Vargasby name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak a ponderousbough or branch, and with it did such things that day, and pounded so manyMoors, that he got the surname of Machuca, and he and his descendants fromthat day forth were called Vargas y Machuca. I mention this because fromthe first oak I see I mean to rend such another branch, large and stoutlike that, with which I am determined and resolved to do such deeds thatthou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in being found worthy to come andsee them, and be an eyewitness of things that will with difficulty bebelieved.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be that as God will,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;I believe it all as your worship saysit; but straighten yourself a little, for you seem all on one side, may befrom the shaking of the fall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the truth,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and if I make no complaint of thepain it is because knights-errant are not permitted to complain of anywound, even though their bowels be coming out through it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If so,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;I have nothing to say; but God knows I would ratheryour worship complained when anything ailed you. For my part, I confess Imust complain however small the ache may be; unless this rule about notcomplaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote could not help laughing at his squire&rsquo;s simplicity, and heassured him he might complain whenever and however he chose, just as heliked, for, so far, he had never read of anything to the contrary in theorder of knighthood.</p><p>Sancho bade him remember it was dinner-time, to which his master answeredthat he wanted nothing himself just then, but that <i>he</i> might eat when hehad a mind. With this permission Sancho settled himself as comfortably ashe could on his beast, and taking out of the alforjas what he had stowedaway in them, he jogged along behind his master munching deliberately, andfrom time to time taking a pull at the bota with a relish that thethirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied; and while he went on inthis way, gulping down draught after draught, he never gave a thought toany of the promises his master had made him, nor did he rate it ashardship but rather as recreation going in quest of adventures, howeverdangerous they might be. Finally they passed the night among some trees,from one of which Don Quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after afashion as a lance, and fixed on it the head he had removed from thebroken one. All that night Don Quixote lay awake thinking of his ladyDulcinea, in order to conform to what he had read in his books, how many anight in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless supportedby the memory of their mistresses. Not so did Sancho Panza spend it, forhaving his stomach full of something stronger than chicory water he madebut one sleep of it, and, if his master had not called him, neither therays of the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes of the birdswelcoming the approach of day would have had power to waken him. Ongetting up he tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than thenight before, which grieved his heart because they did not seem to be onthe way to remedy the deficiency readily. Don Quixote did not care tobreak his fast, for, as has been already said, he confined himself tosavoury recollections for nourishment.</p><p>They returned to the road they had set out with, leading to Puerto Lapice,and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. &ldquo;Here, brotherSancho Panza,&rdquo; said Don Quixote when he saw it, &ldquo;we may plunge our handsup to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe, even shouldstthou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thou must not put a handto thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thou perceivest that those whoassail me are rabble or base folk; for in that case thou mayest veryproperly aid me; but if they be knights it is on no account permitted orallowed thee by the laws of knighthood to help me until thou hast beendubbed a knight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Most certainly, señor,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;your worship shall be fullyobeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and nofriend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards thedefence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, forlaws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against anyassailant whatever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I grant,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;but in this matter of aiding me againstknights thou must put a restraint upon thy natural impetuosity.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will do so, I promise you,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;and will keep thisprecept as carefully as Sunday.&rdquo;</p><p>While they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of theorder of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not less tall werethe two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectacles and carriedsunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or five personson horseback and two muleteers on foot. In the coach there was, asafterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, where herhusband was about to take passage for the Indies with an appointment ofhigh honour. The friars, though going the same road, were not in hercompany; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he said to his squire,&ldquo;Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be the most famous adventurethat has ever been seen, for those black bodies we see there must be, anddoubtless are, magicians who are carrying off some stolen princess in thatcoach, and with all my might I must undo this wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This will be worse than the windmills,&rdquo; said Sancho. &ldquo;Look, señor; thoseare friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to sometravellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don&rsquo;t let thedevil mislead you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have told thee already, Sancho,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;that on thesubject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, asthou shalt see presently.&rdquo;</p><p>So saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road alongwhich the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they had come nearenough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, &ldquo;Devilish and unnaturalbeings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you are carryingoff by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedy death as thejust punishment of your evil deeds.&rdquo;</p><p>The friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don Quixoteas well as at his words, to which they replied, &ldquo;Señor Caballero, we arenot devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St. Benedict following ourroad, nor do we know whether or not there are any captive princessescoming in this coach.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,and without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and with levelledlance charged the first friar with such fury and determination, that, ifthe friar had not flung himself off the mule, he would have brought him tothe ground against his will, and sore wounded, if not killed outright. Thesecond brother, seeing how his comrade was treated, drove his heels intohis castle of a mule and made off across the country faster than the wind.</p><p>Sancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly from hisass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. At that instant thefriars&rsquo; muleteers came up and asked what he was stripping him for. Sanchoanswered them that this fell to him lawfully as spoil of the battle which hislord Don Quixote had won. The muleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did notunderstand all this about battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was somedistance off talking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, knockedhim down, and leaving hardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks andleft him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; and without any moredelay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling, terrified, and pale, as soonas he found himself in the saddle, spurred after his companion, who wasstanding at a distance looking on, watching the result of the onslaught; then,not caring to wait for the end of the affair just begun, they pursued theirjourney making more crosses than if they had the devil after them.</p><p>Don Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:&ldquo;Your beauty, lady mine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;may now dispose of yourperson as may be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of yourravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine; andlest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know that I amcalled Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and adventurer, and captive tothe peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del Toboso: and in return for theservice you have received of me I ask no more than that you should return to ElToboso, and on my behalf present yourself before that lady and tell her what Ihave done to set you free.&rdquo;</p><p>One of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was listeningto all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would not allow thecoach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to El Toboso, hemade at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad Castilian andworse Biscayan after his fashion, &ldquo;Begone, caballero, and ill go withthee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach, slayest thee asart here a Biscayan.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly, &ldquo;Ifthou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have already chastised thyfolly and rashness, miserable creature.&rdquo; To which the Biscayan returned,&ldquo;I no gentleman!&mdash;I swear to God thou liest as I am Christian: ifthou droppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thou see thou artcarrying water to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo at sea, hidalgo atthe devil, and look, if thou sayest otherwise thou liest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;You will see presently,&rdquo; said Agrajes,&rsquo;&rdquo;replied Don Quixote; and throwing his lance on the ground he drew his sword,braced his buckler on his arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking hislife.</p><p>The Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismount fromhis mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for hire, he hadno confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was lucky for him,however, that he was near the coach, from which he was able to snatch acushion that served him for a shield; and they went at one another as ifthey had been two mortal enemies. The others strove to make peace betweenthem, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in his disjointed phrasethat if they did not let him finish his battle he would kill his mistressand everyone that strove to prevent him. The lady in the coach, amazed andterrified at what she saw, ordered the coachman to draw aside a little,and set herself to watch this severe struggle, in the course of which theBiscayan smote Don Quixote a mighty stroke on the shoulder over the top ofhis buckler, which, given to one without armour, would have cleft him tothe waist. Don Quixote, feeling the weight of this prodigious blow, criedaloud, saying, &ldquo;O lady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to theaid of this your knight, who, in fulfilling his obligations to yourbeauty, finds himself in this extreme peril.&rdquo; To say this, to lift hissword, to shelter himself well behind his buckler, and to assail theBiscayan was the work of an instant, determined as he was to venture allupon a single blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on in this way, wasconvinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and resolved to followhis example, so he waited for him keeping well under cover of his cushion,being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his mule, which, deadtired and never meant for this kind of game, could not stir a step.</p><p>On, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan, withuplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half, while on hisside the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and under the protectionof his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting in suspense theresult of blows such as threatened to fall, and the lady in the coach andthe rest of her following were making a thousand vows and offerings to allthe images and shrines of Spain, that God might deliver her squire and allof them from this great peril in which they found themselves. But itspoils all, that at this point and crisis the author of the history leavesthis battle impending, giving as excuse that he could find nothing morewritten about these achievements of Don Quixote than what has been alreadyset forth. It is true the second author of this work was unwilling tobelieve that a history so curious could have been allowed to fall underthe sentence of oblivion, or that the wits of La Mancha could have been soundiscerning as not to preserve in their archives or registries somedocuments referring to this famous knight; and this being his persuasion,he did not despair of finding the conclusion of this pleasant history,which, heaven favouring him, he did find in a way that shall be related inthe Second Part.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c08e" id="c08e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c08e.jpg (54K)" src="images/c08e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br/>IN WHICH IS CONCLUDED AND FINISHED THE TERRIFIC BATTLE BETWEEN THE GALLANTBISCAYAN AND THE VALIANT MANCHEGAN</h3><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c09a" id="c09a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c09a.jpg (142K)" src="images/c09a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c09a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>In the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and therenowned Don Quixote with drawn swords uplifted, ready to deliver two suchfurious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they would atleast have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and laid them openlike a pomegranate; and at this so critical point the delightful historycame to a stop and stood cut short without any intimation from the authorwhere what was missing was to be found.</p><p>This distressed me greatly, because the pleasure derived from having readsuch a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poor chancethat presented itself of finding the large part that, so it seemed to me,was missing of such an interesting tale. It appeared to me to be a thingimpossible and contrary to all precedent that so good a knight should havebeen without some sage to undertake the task of writing his marvellousachievements; a thing that was never wanting to any of thoseknights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; for every one of themhad one or two sages as if made on purpose, who not only recorded theirdeeds but described their most trifling thoughts and follies, howeversecret they might be; and such a good knight could not have been sounfortunate as not to have what Platir and others like him had inabundance. And so I could not bring myself to believe that such a gallanttale had been left maimed and mutilated, and I laid the blame on Time, thedevourer and destroyer of all things, that had either concealed orconsumed it.</p><p>On the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books therehad been found such modern ones as &ldquo;The Enlightenment of Jealousy&rdquo; and the&ldquo;Nymphs and Shepherds of Henares,&rdquo; his story must likewise be modern, andthat though it might not be written, it might exist in the memory of thepeople of his village and of those in the neighbourhood. This reflectionkept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly the whole life andwondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard, Don Quixote of La Mancha, light andmirror of Manchegan chivalry, and the first that in our age and in theseso evil days devoted himself to the labour and exercise of the arms ofknight-errantry, righting wrongs, succouring widows, and protectingdamsels of that sort that used to ride about, whip in hand, on theirpalfreys, with all their virginity about them, from mountain to mountainand valley to valley&mdash;for, if it were not for some ruffian, or boorwith a hood and hatchet, or monstrous giant, that forced them, there werein days of yore damsels that at the end of eighty years, in all which timethey had never slept a day under a roof, went to their graves as muchmaids as the mothers that bore them. I say, then, that in these and otherrespects our gallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and notablepraise, nor should it be withheld even from me for the labour and painsspent in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history; though Iknow well that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped me, theworld would have remained deprived of an entertainment and pleasure thatfor a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall read itattentively. The discovery of it occurred in this way.</p><p>One day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell somepamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, and, as I am fond of readingeven the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bent ofmine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and saw that itwas in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I was unable toread them though I could recognise them, I looked about to see if therewere any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for me; nor wasthere any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter, for even had Isought one for an older and better language I should have found him. Inshort, chance provided me with one, who when I told him what I wanted andput the book into his hands, opened it in the middle and after reading alittle in it began to laugh. I asked him what he was laughing at, and hereplied that it was at something the book had written in the margin by wayof a note. I bade him tell it to me; and he still laughing said, &ldquo;In themargin, as I told you, this is written: &lsquo;<i>This Dulcinea del Toboso so oftenmentioned in this history, had, they say, the best hand of any woman inall La Mancha for salting pigs</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>When I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise andamazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets containedthe history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read thebeginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, hetold me it meant, &ldquo;<i>History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by CidHamete Benengeli, an Arab historian</i>.&rdquo; It required great caution to hidethe joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and snatchingit from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers and pamphlets from theboy for half a real; and if he had had his wits about him and had knownhow eager I was for them, he might have safely calculated on making morethan six reals by the bargain. I withdrew at once with the Morisco intothe cloister of the cathedral, and begged him to turn all these pamphletsthat related to Don Quixote into the Castilian tongue, without omitting oradding anything to them, offering him whatever payment he pleased. He wassatisfied with two arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat, andpromised to translate them faithfully and with all despatch; but to makethe matter easier, and not to let such a precious find out of my hands, Itook him to my house, where in little more than a month and a half hetranslated the whole just as it is set down here.</p><p>In the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan wasdrawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the historydescribes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his buckler, theother by his cushion, and the Biscayan&rsquo;s mule so true to nature that itcould be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. The Biscayan had aninscription under his feet which said, &ldquo;<i>Don Sancho de Azpeitia</i>,&rdquo; which nodoubt must have been his name; and at the feet of Rocinante was anotherthat said, &ldquo;<i>Don Quixote</i>.&rdquo; Rocinante was marvellously portrayed, so longand thin, so lank and lean, with so much backbone and so far gone inconsumption, that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety thename of Rocinante had been bestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panzaholding the halter of his ass, at whose feet was another label that said,&ldquo;Sancho Zancas,&rdquo; and according to the picture, he must have had a bigbelly, a short body, and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, thenames of Panza and Zancas were given him, for by these two surnames thehistory several times calls him. Some other trifling particulars might bementioned, but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to dowith the true relation of the history; and no history can be bad so longas it is true.</p><p>If against the present one any objection be raised on the score of itstruth, it can only be that its author was an Arab, as lying is a verycommon propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are suchenemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions rather thanadditions made in the course of it. And this is my own opinion; for, wherehe could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so worthy aknight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in silence; which isill done and worse contrived, for it is the business and duty ofhistorians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free from passion, andneither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make them swerve fromthe path of truth, whose mother is history, rival of time, storehouse ofdeeds, witness for the past, example and counsel for the present, andwarning for the future. In this I know will be found all that can bedesired in the pleasantest, and if it be wanting in any good quality, Imaintain it is the fault of its hound of an author and not the fault ofthe subject. To be brief, its Second Part, according to the translation,began in this way:</p><p>With trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as though thetwo valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, and earth,and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bear themselves.The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which was deliveredwith such force and fury that had not the sword turned in its course, thatsingle stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the bitter struggle andto all the adventures of our knight; but that good fortune which reservedhim for greater things, turned aside the sword of his adversary, so thatalthough it smote him upon the left shoulder, it did him no more harm thanto strip all that side of its armour, carrying away a great part of hishelmet with half of his ear, all which with fearful ruin fell to theground, leaving him in a sorry plight.</p><p>Good God! Who is there that could properly describe the rage that filledthe heart of our Manchegan when he saw himself dealt with in this fashion?All that can be said is, it was such that he again raised himself in hisstirrups, and, grasping his sword more firmly with both hands, he camedown on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him full over the cushion andover the head, that&mdash;even so good a shield proving useless&mdash;asif a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed from nose, mouth, andears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from his mule, as no doubt hewould have done had he not flung his arms about its neck; at the sametime, however, he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and then unclaspedhis arms, and the mule, taking fright at the terrible blow, made offacross the plain, and with a few plunges flung its master to the ground.Don Quixote stood looking on very calmly, and, when he saw him fall,leaped from his horse and with great briskness ran to him, and, presentingthe point of his sword to his eyes, bade him surrender, or he would cuthis head off. The Biscayan was so bewildered that he was unable to answera word, and it would have gone hard with him, so blind was Don Quixote,had not the ladies in the coach, who had hitherto been watching the combatin great terror, hastened to where he stood and implored him with earnestentreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing theirsquire&rsquo;s life; to which Don Quixote replied with much gravity and dignity,&ldquo;In truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what ye ask of me; but itmust be on one condition and understanding, which is that this knightpromise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on my behalf presenthimself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she deal with him as shallbe most pleasing to her.&rdquo;</p><p>The terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote&rsquo;sdemand or asking who Dulcinea might be, promised that their squire shoulddo all that had been commanded.</p><p>&ldquo;Then, on the faith of that promise,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;I shall do him nofurther harm, though he well deserves it of me.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c09e" id="c09e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c09e.jpg (61K)" src="images/c09e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c09e.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.<br/>OF THE PLEASANT DISCOURSE THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRESANCHO PANZA</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c10a" id="c10a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c10a.jpg (91K)" src="images/c10a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c10a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Now by this time Sancho had risen, rather the worse for the handling ofthe friars&rsquo; muleteers, and stood watching the battle of his master, DonQuixote, and praying to God in his heart that it might be his will togrant him the victory, and that he might thereby win some island to makehim governor of, as he had promised. Seeing, therefore, that the strugglewas now over, and that his master was returning to mount Rocinante, heapproached to hold the stirrup for him, and, before he could mount, hewent on his knees before him, and taking his hand, kissed it saying, &ldquo;Mayit please your worship, Señor Don Quixote, to give me the government ofthat island which has been won in this hard fight, for be it ever so big Ifeel myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and aswell as anyone in the world who has ever governed islands.&rdquo;</p><p>To which Don Quixote replied, &ldquo;Thou must take notice, brother Sancho, thatthis adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands, but ofcross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or an ear theless: have patience, for adventures will present themselves from which Imay make you, not only a governor, but something more.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho gave him many thanks, and again kissing his hand and the skirt ofhis hauberk, helped him to mount Rocinante, and mounting his ass himself,proceeded to follow his master, who at a brisk pace, without taking leave,or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the coach, turnedinto a wood that was hard by. Sancho followed him at his ass&rsquo;s best trot,but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind, he wasforced to call to his master to wait for him. Don Quixote did so, reiningin Rocinante until his weary squire came up, who on reaching him said, &ldquo;Itseems to me, señor, it would be prudent in us to go and take refuge insome church, for, seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has been left,it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to the HolyBrotherhood and arrest us, and, faith, if they do, before we come out ofgaol we shall have to sweat for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;where hast thou ever seen or heard that aknight-errant has been arraigned before a court of justice, however manyhomicides he may have committed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know nothing about omecils,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;nor in my life have hadanything to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhood looks afterthose who fight in the fields, and in that other matter I do not meddle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for Iwill deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much more out ofthose of the Brotherhood. But tell me, as thou livest, hast thou seen amore valiant knight than I in all the known world; hast thou read inhistory of any who has or had higher mettle in attack, more spirit inmaintaining it, more dexterity in wounding or skill in overthrowing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;that I have never read any history, forI can neither read nor write, but what I will venture to bet is that amore daring master than your worship I have never served in all the daysof my life, and God grant that this daring be not paid for where I havesaid; what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound, for a great dealof blood flows from that ear, and I have here some lint and a little whiteointment in the alforjas.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that might be well dispensed with,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;if I hadremembered to make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras, for time andmedicine are saved by one single drop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What vial and what balsam is that?&rdquo; said Sancho Panza.</p><p>&ldquo;It is a balsam,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;the receipt of which I have in mymemory, with which one need have no fear of death, or dread dying of anywound; and so when I make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing to dowhen in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through the middleof the body&mdash;as is wont to happen frequently&mdash;but neatly andwith great nicety, ere the blood congeal, to place that portion of thebody which shall have fallen to the ground upon the other half whichremains in the saddle, taking care to fit it on evenly and exactly. Thenthou shalt give me to drink but two drops of the balsam I have mentioned,and thou shalt see me become sounder than an apple.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If that be so,&rdquo; said Panza, &ldquo;I renounce henceforth the government of thepromised island, and desire nothing more in payment of my many andfaithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of thissupreme liquor, for I am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals anounce anywhere, and I want no more to pass the rest of my life in ease andhonour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to make it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With less than three reals, six quarts of it may be made,&rdquo; said DonQuixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Sinner that I am!&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;then why does your worship put offmaking it and teaching it to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peace, friend,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote; &ldquo;greater secrets I mean to teachthee and greater favours to bestow upon thee; and for the present let ussee to the dressing, for my ear pains me more than I could wish.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas; but when DonQuixote came to see his helmet shattered, he was like to lose his senses,and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to heaven, hesaid, &ldquo;I swear by the Creator of all things and the four Gospels in theirfullest extent, to do as the great Marquis of Mantua did when he swore toavenge the death of his nephew Baldwin (and that was not to eat bread froma table-cloth, nor embrace his wife, and other points which, though Icannot now call them to mind, I here grant as expressed) until I takecomplete vengeance upon him who has committed such an offence against me.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing this, Sancho said to him, &ldquo;Your worship should bear in mind, SeñorDon Quixote, that if the knight has done what was commanded him in goingto present himself before my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he will have doneall that he was bound to do, and does not deserve further punishmentunless he commits some new offence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou hast said well and hit the point,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote; and so Irecall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him, butI make and confirm it anew to lead the life I have said until such time asI take by force from some knight another helmet such as this and as good;and think not, Sancho, that I am raising smoke with straw in doing so, forI have one to imitate in the matter, since the very same thing to a hairhappened in the case of Mambrino&rsquo;s helmet, which cost Sacripante so dear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;let your worship send all such oaths to thedevil, for they are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to theconscience; just tell me now, if for several days to come we fall in withno man armed with a helmet, what are we to do? Is the oath to be observedin spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will be to sleep inyour clothes, and not to sleep in a house, and a thousand othermortifications contained in the oath of that old fool the Marquis ofMantua, which your worship is now wanting to revive? Let your worshipobserve that there are no men in armour travelling on any of these roads,nothing but carriers and carters, who not only do not wear helmets, butperhaps never heard tell of them all their lives.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art wrong there,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for we shall not have beenabove two hours among these cross-roads before we see more men in armourthan came to Albraca to win the fair Angelica.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;so be it then, and God grant us success, and thatthe time for winning that island which is costing me so dear may sooncome, and then let me die.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have already told thee, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;not to give thyselfany uneasiness on that score; for if an island should fail, there is thekingdom of Denmark, or of Sobradisa, which will fit thee as a ring fitsthe finger, and all the more that, being on <i>terra firma</i>, thou wilt all thebetter enjoy thyself. But let us leave that to its own time; see if thouhast anything for us to eat in those alforjas, because we must presentlygo in quest of some castle where we may lodge to-night and make the balsamI told thee of, for I swear to thee by God, this ear is giving me greatpain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,&rdquo; saidSancho, &ldquo;but they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight like yourworship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How little thou knowest about it,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote; &ldquo;I would havethee to know, Sancho, that it is the glory of knights-errant to go withouteating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it should be of whatcomes first to hand; and this would have been clear to thee hadst thouread as many histories as I have, for, though they are very many, amongthem all I have found no mention made of knights-errant eating, unless byaccident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for them, and the rest ofthe time they passed in dalliance. And though it is plain they could notdo without eating and performing all the other natural functions, because,in fact, they were men like ourselves, it is plain too that, wandering asthey did the most part of their lives through woods and wilds and withouta cook, their most usual fare would be rustic viands such as those thounow offer me; so that, friend Sancho, let not that distress thee whichpleases me, and do not seek to make a new world or pervertknight-errantry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon me, your worship,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for, as I cannot read or write,as I said just now, I neither know nor comprehend the rules of theprofession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the alforjas with everykind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and for myself,as I am not one, I will furnish them with poultry and other things moresubstantial.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not say, Sancho,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;that it is imperative onknights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest of;only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs theyfound in the fields which they knew and I know too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A good thing it is,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;to know those herbs, for to mythinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into practice.&rdquo;</p><p>And here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made theirrepast peaceably and sociably. But anxious to find quarters for the night,they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare, mounted atonce, and made haste to reach some habitation before night set in; butdaylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed them close bythe huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass the night there,and it was as much to Sancho&rsquo;s discontent not to have reached a house, asit was to his master&rsquo;s satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven, for hefancied that each time this happened to him he performed an act ofownership that helped to prove his chivalry.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c10e" id="c10e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c10e.jpg (57K)" src="images/c10e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br/>WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH CERTAIN GOATHERDS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c11a" id="c11a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c11a.jpg (173K)" src="images/c11a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c11a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>He was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and Sancho, having as best hecould put up Rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance that camefrom some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire; and thoughhe would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be transferredfrom the pot to the stomach, he refrained from doing so as the goatherdsremoved them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on the ground, quicklyspread their rude table, and with signs of hearty good-will invited themboth to share what they had. Round the skins six of the men belonging tothe fold seated themselves, having first with rough politeness pressed DonQuixote to take a seat upon a trough which they placed for him upsidedown. Don Quixote seated himself, and Sancho remained standing to servethe cup, which was made of horn. Seeing him standing, his master said tohim:</p><p>&ldquo;That thou mayest see, Sancho, the good that knight-errantry contains initself, and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road to bespeedily honoured and esteemed by the world, I desire that thou seatthyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people, andthat thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, and that thoueat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; for the same maybe said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levels all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great thanks,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but I may tell your worship that provided Ihave enough to eat, I can eat it as well, or better, standing, and bymyself, than seated alongside of an emperor. And indeed, if the truth isto be told, what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has much morerelish for me, even though it be bread and onions, than the turkeys ofthose other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drink little, wipe mymouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if I want or do otherthings that are the privileges of liberty and solitude. So, señor, as forthese honours which your worship would put upon me as a servant andfollower of knight-errantry, exchange them for other things which may beof more use and advantage to me; for these, though I fully acknowledgethem as received, I renounce from this moment to the end of the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;thou must seat thyself, because him whohumbleth himself God exalteth;&rdquo; and seizing him by the arm he forced himto sit down beside himself.</p><p>The goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires andknights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at theirguests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away pieces asbig as one&rsquo;s fist. The course of meat finished, they spread upon thesheepskins a great heap of parched acorns, and with them they put down ahalf cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar. All this while thehorn was not idle, for it went round so constantly, now full, now empty,like the bucket of a water-wheel, that it soon drained one of the twowine-skins that were in sight. When Don Quixote had quite appeased hisappetite he took up a handful of the acorns, and contemplating themattentively delivered himself somewhat in this fashion:</p><p>&ldquo;Happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name ofgolden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this ouriron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in it knewnot the two words &ldquo;<i>mine</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>thine</i>&rdquo;! In that blessed age all things werein common; to win the daily food no labour was required of any save tostretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks that stoodgenerously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. The clear streams andrunning brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in noble abundance. Thebusy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in the clefts of the rocksand hollows of the trees, offering without usance the plenteous produce oftheir fragrant toil to every hand. The mighty cork trees, unenforced saveof their own courtesy, shed the broad light bark that served at first toroof the houses supported by rude stakes, a protection against theinclemency of heaven alone. Then all was peace, all friendship, allconcord; as yet the dull share of the crooked plough had not dared to rendand pierce the tender bowels of our first mother that without compulsionyielded from every portion of her broad fertile bosom all that couldsatisfy, sustain, and delight the children that then possessed her. Thenwas it that the innocent and fair young shepherdess roamed from vale tovale and hill to hill, with flowing locks, and no more garments than wereneedful modestly to cover what modesty seeks and ever sought to hide. Norwere their ornaments like those in use to-day, set off by Tyrian purple,and silk tortured in endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of thegreen dock and ivy, wherewith they went as bravely and becomingly deckedas our Court dames with all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idlecuriosity has taught them. Then the love-thoughts of the heart clothedthemselves simply and naturally as the heart conceived them, nor sought tocommend themselves by forced and rambling verbiage. Fraud, deceit, ormalice had then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity. Justice held herground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and ofinterest, that now so much impair, pervert, and beset her. Arbitrary lawhad not yet established itself in the mind of the judge, for then therewas no cause to judge and no one to be judged. Maidens and modesty, as Ihave said, wandered at will alone and unattended, without fear of insultfrom lawlessness or libertine assault, and if they were undone it was oftheir own will and pleasure. But now in this hateful age of ours not oneis safe, not though some new labyrinth like that of Crete conceal andsurround her; even there the pestilence of gallantry will make its way tothem through chinks or on the air by the zeal of its accursed importunity,and, despite of all seclusion, lead them to ruin. In defence of these, astime advanced and wickedness increased, the order of knights-errant wasinstituted, to defend maidens, to protect widows and to succour theorphans and the needy. To this order I belong, brother goatherds, to whomI return thanks for the hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and mysquire; for though by natural law all living are bound to show favour toknights-errant, yet, seeing that without knowing this obligation ye havewelcomed and feasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in mypower I should thank you for yours.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c11b" id="c11b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c11b.jpg (349K)" src="images/c11b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c11b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>All this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our knightdelivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the golden age;and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary argument to thegoatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement without saying a wordin reply. Sancho likewise held his peace and ate acorns, and paid repeatedvisits to the second wine-skin, which they had hung up on a cork tree tokeep the wine cool.</p><p>Don Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at the endof which one of the goatherds said, &ldquo;That your worship, señorknight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality withready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by making one ofour comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a veryintelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read and writeand play on the rebeck to perfection.&rdquo;</p><p>The goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeckreached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a verygood-looking young man of about two-and-twenty. His comrades asked him ifhe had supped, and on his replying that he had, he who had already madethe offer said to him:</p><p>&ldquo;In that case, Antonio, thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of singinga little, that the gentleman, our guest, may see that even in themountains and woods there are musicians: we have told him of thyaccomplishments, and we want thee to show them and prove that we say true;so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy love thatthy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so much liked in thetown.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said the young man, and without waiting for morepressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak, and tuning hisrebeck, presently began to sing to these words.</p><p class="poem">ANTONIO&rsquo;S BALLAD<br/><br/>Thou dost love me well, Olalla;<br/>Well I know it, even though<br/>Love&rsquo;s mute tongues, thine eyes, have never<br/>By their glances told me so.<br/><br/>For I know my love thou knowest,<br/>Therefore thine to claim I dare:<br/>Once it ceases to be secret,<br/>Love need never feel despair.<br/><br/>True it is, Olalla, sometimes<br/>Thou hast all too plainly shown<br/>That thy heart is brass in hardness,<br/>And thy snowy bosom stone.<br/><br/>Yet for all that, in thy coyness,<br/>And thy fickle fits between,<br/>Hope is there&mdash;at least the border<br/>Of her garment may be seen.<br/><br/>Lures to faith are they, those glimpses,<br/>And to faith in thee I hold;<br/>Kindness cannot make it stronger,<br/>Coldness cannot make it cold.<br/><br/>If it be that love is gentle,<br/>In thy gentleness I see<br/>Something holding out assurance<br/>To the hope of winning thee.<br/><br/>If it be that in devotion<br/>Lies a power hearts to move,<br/>That which every day I show thee,<br/>Helpful to my suit should prove.<br/><br/>Many a time thou must have noticed&mdash;<br/>If to notice thou dost care&mdash;<br/>How I go about on Monday<br/>Dressed in all my Sunday wear.<br/><br/>Love&rsquo;s eyes love to look on brightness;<br/>Love loves what is gaily drest;<br/>Sunday, Monday, all I care is<br/>Thou shouldst see me in my best.<br/><br/>No account I make of dances,<br/>Or of strains that pleased thee so,<br/>Keeping thee awake from midnight<br/>Till the cocks began to crow;<br/><br/>Or of how I roundly swore it<br/>That there&rsquo;s none so fair as thou;<br/>True it is, but as I said it,<br/>By the girls I&rsquo;m hated now.<br/><br/>For Teresa of the hillside<br/>At my praise of thee was sore;<br/>Said, &ldquo;You think you love an angel;<br/>It&rsquo;s a monkey you adore;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Caught by all her glittering trinkets,<br/>And her borrowed braids of hair,<br/>And a host of made-up beauties<br/>That would Love himself ensnare.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&rsquo;Twas a lie, and so I told her,<br/>And her cousin at the word<br/>Gave me his defiance for it;<br/>And what followed thou hast heard.<br/><br/>Mine is no high-flown affection,<br/>Mine no passion <i>par amours</i>&mdash;<br/>As they call it&mdash;what I offer<br/>Is an honest love, and pure.<br/><br/>Cunning cords the holy Church has,<br/>Cords of softest silk they be;<br/>Put thy neck beneath the yoke, dear;<br/>Mine will follow, thou wilt see.<br/><br/>Else&mdash;and once for all I swear it<br/>By the saint of most renown&mdash;<br/>If I ever quit the mountains,<br/>&rsquo;Twill be in a friar&rsquo;s gown.<br/></p><p>Here the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though Don Quixoteentreated him to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being moreinclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to his master,&ldquo;Your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to pass thenight, for the labour these good men are at all day does not allow them tospend the night in singing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand thee, Sancho,&rdquo;

and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which there wasa great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with a little salt,and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a bandage,assuring him that no other treatment would be required, and so it proved.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c11e" id="c11e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c11e.jpg (37K)" src="images/c11e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br/>OF WHAT A GOATHERD RELATED TO THOSE WITH DON QUIXOTE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c12a" id="c12a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c12a.jpg (143K)" src="images/c12a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c12a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Just then another young man, one of those who fetched their provisionsfrom the village, came up and said, &ldquo;Do you know what is going on in thevillage, comrades?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How could we know it?&rdquo;

I am sure it will be something worth seeing; at least I will notfail to go and see it even if I knew I should not return to the villageto-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We will do the same,&rdquo; answered the goatherds, &ldquo;and cast lots to see whomust stay to mind the goats of all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou sayest well, Pedro,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;though there will be no need oftaking that trouble, for I will stay behind for all; and don&rsquo;t suppose itis virtue or want of curiosity in me; it is that the splinter that raninto my foot the other day will not let me walk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that, we thank thee,&rdquo; answered Pedro.</p><p>Don Quixote asked Pedro to tell him who the dead man was and who theshepherdess, to which Pedro replied that all he knew was that the dead manwas a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains, who hadbeen a student at Salamanca for many years, at the end of which hereturned to his village with the reputation of being very learned anddeeply read. &ldquo;Above all, they said, he was learned in the science of thestars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun and the moon,for he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those twoluminaries,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself withtrifles, went on with his story, saying, &ldquo;Also he foretold when the yearwas going to be one of abundance or estility.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sterility, you mean,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Sterility or estility,&rdquo; answered Pedro, &ldquo;it is all the same in the end.And I can tell you that by this his father and friends who believed himgrew very rich because they did as he advised them, bidding them &lsquo;sowbarley this year, not wheat; this year you may sow pulse and not barley;the next there will be a full oil crop, and the three following not a dropwill be got.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That science is called astrology,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not know what it is called,&rdquo; replied Pedro, &ldquo;but I know that he knewall this and more besides. But, to make an end, not many months had passedafter he returned from Salamanca, when one day he appeared dressed as ashepherd with his crook and sheepskin, having put off the long gown hewore as a scholar; and at the same time his great friend, Ambrosio byname, who had been his companion in his studies, took to the shepherd&rsquo;sdress with him. I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who is dead, was a greatman for writing verses, so much so that he made carols for Christmas Eve,and plays for Corpus Christi, which the young men of our village acted,and all said they were excellent. When the villagers saw the two scholarsso unexpectedly appearing in shepherd&rsquo;s dress, they were lost in wonder,and could not guess what had led them to make so extraordinary a change.About this time the father of our Chrysostom died, and he was left heir toa large amount of property in chattels as well as in land, no small numberof cattle and sheep, and a large sum of money, of all of which the youngman was left dissolute owner, and indeed he was deserving of it all, forhe was a very good comrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of worthy folk,and had a countenance like a benediction. Presently it came to be knownthat he had changed his dress with no other object than to wander aboutthese wastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago,with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love. And I must tell younow, for it is well you should know it, who this girl is; perhaps, andeven without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like it all thedays of your life, though you should live more years than sarna.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say Sarra,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd&rsquo;s confusionof words.</p><p>&ldquo;The sarna lives long enough,&rdquo; answered Pedro; &ldquo;and if, señor, you must gofinding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end of itthis twelvemonth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon me, friend,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but, as there is such a differencebetween sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; however, you have answered veryrightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: so continue your story, and Iwill not object any more to anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I say then, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the goatherd, &ldquo;that in our village therewas a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who was namedGuillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over and above great wealth, adaughter at whose birth her mother died, the most respected woman therewas in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her now with that countenancewhich had the sun on one side and the moon on the other; and moreoveractive, and kind to the poor, for which I trust that at the present momenther soul is in bliss with God in the other world. Her husband Guillermodied of grief at the death of so good a wife, leaving his daughterMarcela, a child and rich, to the care of an uncle of hers, a priest andprebendary in our village. The girl grew up with such beauty that itreminded us of her mother&rsquo;s, which was very great, and yet it was thoughtthat the daughter&rsquo;s would exceed it; and so when she reached the age offourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld her but blessed God that had madeher so beautiful, and the greater number were in love with her pastredemption. Her uncle kept her in great seclusion and retirement, but forall that the fame of her great beauty spread so that, as well for it asfor her great wealth, her uncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, togive her in marriage not only by those of our town but of those manyleagues round, and by the persons of highest quality in them. But he,being a good Christian man, though he desired to give her in marriage atonce, seeing her to be old enough, was unwilling to do so without herconsent, not that he had any eye to the gain and profit which the custodyof the girl&rsquo;s property brought him while he put off her marriage; and,faith, this was said in praise of the good priest in more than one set inthe town. For I would have you know, Sir Errant, that in these littlevillages everything is talked about and everything is carped at, and restassured, as I am, that the priest must be over and above good who forceshis parishioners to speak well of him, especially in villages.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the truth,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but go on, for the story is verygood, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May that of the Lord not be wanting to me,&rdquo; said Pedro; &ldquo;that is the oneto have. To proceed; you must know that though the uncle put before hisniece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular of themany who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry and make a choiceaccording to her own taste, she never gave any other answer than that shehad no desire to marry just yet, and that being so young she did not thinkherself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. At these, to all appearance,reasonable excuses that she made, her uncle ceased to urge her, and waitedtill she was somewhat more advanced in age and could mate herself to herown liking. For, said he&mdash;and he said quite right&mdash;parents arenot to settle children in life against their will. But when one leastlooked for it, lo and behold! one day the demure Marcela makes herappearance turned shepherdess; and, in spite of her uncle and all those ofthe town that strove to dissuade her, took to going a-field with the othershepherd-lasses of the village, and tending her own flock. And so, sinceshe appeared in public, and her beauty came to be seen openly, I could notwell tell you how many rich youths, gentlemen and peasants, have adoptedthe costume of Chrysostom, and go about these fields making love to her.One of these, as has been already said, was our deceased friend, of whomthey say that he did not love but adore her. But you must not suppose,because Marcela chose a life of such liberty and independence, and of solittle or rather no retirement, that she has given any occasion, or eventhe semblance of one, for disparagement of her purity and modesty; on thecontrary, such and so great is the vigilance with which she watches overher honour, that of all those that court and woo her not one has boasted,or can with truth boast, that she has given him any hope however small ofobtaining his desire. For although she does not avoid or shun the societyand conversation of the shepherds, and treats them courteously and kindly,should any one of them come to declare his intention to her, though it beone as proper and holy as that of matrimony, she flings him from her likea catapult. And with this kind of disposition she does more harm in thiscountry than if the plague had got into it, for her affability and herbeauty draw on the hearts of those that associate with her to love her andto court her, but her scorn and her frankness bring them to the brink ofdespair; and so they know not what to say save to proclaim her aloud crueland hard-hearted, and other names of the same sort which well describe thenature of her character; and if you should remain here any time, señor,you would hear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of therejected ones who pursue her. Not far from this there is a spot wherethere are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and there is not one of thembut has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela, andabove some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover would saymore plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human beauty. Hereone shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; there love songs areheard, here despairing elegies. One will pass all the hours of the nightseated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there, without having closedhis weeping eyes, the sun finds him in the morning bemused and bereft ofsense; and another without relief or respite to his sighs, stretched onthe burning sand in the full heat of the sultry summer noontide, makes hisappeal to the compassionate heavens, and over one and the other, overthese and all, the beautiful Marcela triumphs free and careless. And allof us that know her are waiting to see what her pride will come to, andwho is to be the happy man that will succeed in taming a nature soformidable and gaining possession of a beauty so supreme. All that I havetold you being such well-established truth, I am persuaded that what theysay of the cause of Chrysostom&rsquo;s death, as our lad told us, is the same.And so I advise you, señor, fail not to be present to-morrow at hisburial, which will be well worth seeing, for Chrysostom had many friends,and it is not half a league from this place to where he directed he shouldbe buried.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will make a point of it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and I thank you for thepleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the goatherd, &ldquo;I do not know even the half of what has happenedto the lovers of Marcela, but perhaps to-morrow we may fall in with someshepherd on the road who can tell us; and now it will be well for you togo and sleep under cover, for the night air may hurt your wound, thoughwith the remedy I have applied to you there is no fear of an untowardresult.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho Panza, who was wishing the goatherd&rsquo;s loquacity at the devil, onhis part begged his master to go into Pedro&rsquo;s hut to sleep. He did so, andpassed all the rest of the night in thinking of his lady Dulcinea, inimitation of the lovers of Marcela. Sancho Panza settled himself betweenRocinante and his ass, and slept, not like a lover who had been discarded,but like a man who had been soundly kicked.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c12e" id="c12e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c12e.jpg (42K)" src="images/c12e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br/>IN WHICH IS ENDED THE STORY OF THE SHEPHERDESS MARCELA, WITH OTHERINCIDENTS</h3><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c13a" id="c13a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c13a.jpg (181K)" src="images/c13a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c13a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>But hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of the east,when five of the six goatherds came to rouse Don Quixote and tell him thatif he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of Chrysostomthey would bear him company. Don Quixote, who desired nothing better, roseand ordered Sancho to saddle and pannel at once, which he did with alldespatch, and with the same they all set out forthwith. They had not gonea quarter of a league when at the meeting of two paths they saw comingtowards them some six shepherds dressed in black sheepskins and with theirheads crowned with garlands of cypress and bitter oleander. Each of themcarried a stout holly staff in his hand, and along with them there cametwo men of quality on horseback in handsome travelling dress, with threeservants on foot accompanying them. Courteous salutations were exchangedon meeting, and inquiring one of the other which way each party was going,they learned that all were bound for the scene of the burial, so they wenton all together.</p><p>One of those on horseback addressing his companion said to him, &ldquo;It seemsto me, Señor Vivaldo, that we may reckon as well spent the delay we shallincur in seeing this remarkable funeral, for remarkable it cannot but bejudging by the strange things these shepherds have told us, of both thedead shepherd and homicide shepherdess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I think too,&rdquo; replied Vivaldo, &ldquo;and I would delay not to say a day,but four, for the sake of seeing it.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote asked them what it was they had heard of Marcela andChrysostom. The traveller answered that the same morning they had metthese shepherds, and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion they hadasked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise; which one ofthem gave, describing the strange behaviour and beauty of a shepherdesscalled Marcela, and the loves of many who courted her, together with thedeath of that Chrysostom to whose burial they were going. In short, herepeated all that Pedro had related to Don Quixote.</p><p>This conversation dropped, and another was commenced by him who was calledVivaldo asking Don Quixote what was the reason that led him to go armed inthat fashion in a country so peaceful. To which Don Quixote replied, &ldquo;Thepursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to go in any otherfashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were invented for softcourtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and made for thosealone whom the world calls knights-errant, of whom I, though unworthy, amthe least of all.&rdquo;</p><p>The instant they heard this all set him down as mad, and the better tosettle the point and discover what kind of madness his was, Vivaldoproceeded to ask him what knights-errant meant.</p><p>&ldquo;Have not your worships,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;read the annals andhistories of England, in which are recorded the famous deeds of KingArthur, whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus, withregard to whom it is an ancient tradition, and commonly received all overthat kingdom of Great Britain, that this king did not die, but was changedby magic art into a raven, and that in process of time he is to return toreign and recover his kingdom and sceptre; for which reason it cannot beproved that from that time to this any Englishman ever killed a raven?Well, then, in the time of this good king that famous order of chivalry ofthe Knights of the Round Table was instituted, and the amour of DonLancelot of the Lake with the Queen Guinevere occurred, precisely as isthere related, the go-between and confidante therein being the highlyhonourable dame Quintañona, whence came that ballad so well known andwidely spread in our Spain&mdash;</p><p class="poem">O never surely was there knight<br/>    So served by hand of dame,<br/>As served was he Sir Lancelot hight<br/>    When he from Britain came&mdash;</p><p class="noindent">with all the sweet and delectable course of his achievements in love andwar. Handed down from that time, then, this order of chivalry went onextending and spreading itself over many and various parts of the world;and in it, famous and renowned for their deeds, were the mighty Amadis ofGaul with all his sons and descendants to the fifth generation, and thevaliant Felixmarte of Hircania, and the never sufficiently praised Tiranteel Blanco, and in our own days almost we have seen and heard and talkedwith the invincible knight Don Belianis of Greece. This, then, sirs, is tobe a knight-errant, and what I have spoken of is the order of hischivalry, of which, as I have already said, I, though a sinner, have madeprofession, and what the aforesaid knights professed that same do Iprofess, and so I go through these solitudes and wilds seeking adventures,resolved in soul to oppose my arm and person to the most perilous thatfortune may offer me in aid of the weak and needy.&rdquo;</p><p>By these words of his the travellers were able to satisfy themselves ofDon Quixote&rsquo;s being out of his senses and of the form of madness thatovermastered him, at which they felt the same astonishment that all felton first becoming acquainted with it; and Vivaldo, who was a person ofgreat shrewdness and of a lively temperament, in order to beguile theshort journey which they said was required to reach the mountain, thescene of the burial, sought to give him an opportunity of going on withhis absurdities. So he said to him, &ldquo;It seems to me, Señor Knight-errant,that your worship has made choice of one of the most austere professionsin the world, and I imagine even that of the Carthusian monks is not soaustere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As austere it may perhaps be,&rdquo; replied our Don Quixote, &ldquo;but so necessaryfor the world I am very much inclined to doubt. For, if the truth is to betold, the soldier who executes what his captain orders does no less thanthe captain himself who gives the order. My meaning, is, that churchmen inpeace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare of the world, but wesoldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray for, defending itwith the might of our arms and the edge of our swords, not under shelterbut in the open air, a target for the intolerable rays of the sun insummer and the piercing frosts of winter. Thus are we God&rsquo;s ministers onearth and the arms by which his justice is done therein. And as thebusiness of war and all that relates and belongs to it cannot be conductedwithout exceeding great sweat, toil, and exertion, it follows that thosewho make it their profession have undoubtedly more labour than those whoin tranquil peace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to help theweak. I do not mean to say, nor does it enter into my thoughts, that theknight-errant&rsquo;s calling is as good as that of the monk in his cell; Iwould merely infer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a doubt amore laborious and a more belaboured one, a hungrier and thirstier, awretcheder, raggeder, and lousier; for there is no reason to doubt thatthe knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course of theirlives. And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise to beemperors, in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and sweat; andif those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and sages to helpthem they would have been completely baulked in their ambition anddisappointed in their hopes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is my own opinion,&rdquo; replied the traveller; &ldquo;but one thing among manyothers seems to me very wrong in knights-errant, and that is that whenthey find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilous adventurein which there is manifest danger of losing their lives, they never at themoment of engaging in it think of commending themselves to God, as is theduty of every good Christian in like peril; instead of which they commendthemselves to their ladies with as much devotion as if these were theirgods, a thing which seems to me to savour somewhat of heathenism.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;that cannot be on any account omitted, andthe knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise: for it is usualand customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant, who on engagingin any great feat of arms has his lady before him, should turn his eyestowards her softly and lovingly, as though with them entreating her tofavour and protect him in the hazardous venture he is about to undertake,and even though no one hear him, he is bound to say certain words betweenhis teeth, commending himself to her with all his heart, and of this wehave innumerable instances in the histories. Nor is it to be supposed fromthis that they are to omit commending themselves to God, for there will betime and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their task.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; answered the traveller, &ldquo;I feel some doubt still, becauseoften I have read how words will arise between two knights-errant, andfrom one thing to another it comes about that their anger kindles and theywheel their horses round and take a good stretch of field, and thenwithout any more ado at the top of their speed they come to the charge,and in mid-career they are wont to commend themselves to their ladies; andwhat commonly comes of the encounter is that one falls over the haunchesof his horse pierced through and through by his antagonist&rsquo;s lance, and asfor the other, it is only by holding on to the mane of his horse that hecan help falling to the ground; but I know not how the dead man had timeto commend himself to God in the course of such rapid work as this; itwould have been better if those words which he spent in commending himselfto his lady in the midst of his career had been devoted to his duty andobligation as a Christian. Moreover, it is my belief that allknights-errant have not ladies to commend themselves to, for they are notall in love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; said Don Quixote: &ldquo;I say it is impossible that therecould be a knight-errant without a lady, because to such it is as naturaland proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: most certainlyno history has been seen in which there is to be found a knight-errantwithout an amour, and for the simple reason that without one he would beheld no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one who had gained entranceinto the stronghold of the said knighthood, not by the door, but over thewall like a thief and a robber.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said the traveller, &ldquo;if I remember rightly, I think I haveread that Don Galaor, the brother of the valiant Amadis of Gaul, never hadany special lady to whom he might commend himself, and yet he was not theless esteemed, and was a very stout and famous knight.&rdquo;</p><p>To which our Don Quixote made answer, &ldquo;Sir, one solitary swallow does notmake summer; moreover, I know that knight was in secret very deeply inlove; besides which, that way of falling in love with all that took hisfancy was a natural propensity which he could not control. But, in short,it is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made mistress of hiswill, to whom he commended himself very frequently and very secretly, forhe prided himself on being a reticent knight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then if it be essential that every knight-errant should be in love,&rdquo; saidthe traveller, &ldquo;it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so, as youare of the order; and if you do not pride yourself on being as reticent asDon Galaor, I entreat you as earnestly as I can, in the name of all thiscompany and in my own, to inform us of the name, country, rank, and beautyof your lady, for she will esteem herself fortunate if all the world knowsthat she is loved and served by such a knight as your worship seems tobe.&rdquo;</p><p>At this Don Quixote heaved a deep sigh and said, &ldquo;I cannot say positivelywhether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world should know Iserve her; I can only say in answer to what has been so courteously askedof me, that her name is Dulcinea, her country El Toboso, a village of LaMancha, her rank must be at least that of a princess, since she is myqueen and lady, and her beauty superhuman, since all the impossible andfanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies areverified in her; for her hairs are gold, her forehead Elysian fields, hereyebrows rainbows, her eyes suns, her cheeks roses, her lips coral, herteeth pearls, her neck alabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, herfairness snow, and what modesty conceals from sight such, I think andimagine, as rational reflection can only extol, not compare.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We should like to know her lineage, race, and ancestry,&rdquo; said Vivaldo.</p><p>To which Don Quixote replied, &ldquo;She is not of the ancient Roman Curtii,Caii, or Scipios, nor of the modern Colonnas or Orsini, nor of theMoncadas or Requesenes of Catalonia, nor yet of the Rebellas or Villanovasof Valencia; Palafoxes, Nuzas, Rocabertis, Corellas, Lunas, Alagones,Urreas, Foces, or Gurreas of Aragon; Cerdas, Manriques, Mendozas, orGuzmans of Castile; Alencastros, Pallas, or Meneses of Portugal; but sheis of those of El Toboso of La Mancha, a lineage that though modern, mayfurnish a source of gentle blood for the most illustrious families of theages that are to come, and this let none dispute with me save on thecondition that Zerbino placed at the foot of the trophy of Orlando&rsquo;s arms,saying,</p><p class="poem">These let none move<br/>Who dareth not his might with Roland prove.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Although mine is of the Cachopins of Laredo,&rdquo; said the traveller, &ldquo;I willnot venture to compare it with that of El Toboso of La Mancha, though, totell the truth, no such surname has until now ever reached my ears.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;has that never reached them?&rdquo;</p><p>The rest of the party went along listening with great attention to theconversation of the pair, and even the very goatherds and shepherdsperceived how exceedingly out of his wits our Don Quixote was. SanchoPanza alone thought that what his master said was the truth, knowing whohe was and having known him from his birth; and all that he felt anydifficulty in believing was that about the fair Dulcinea del Toboso,because neither any such name nor any such princess had ever come to hisknowledge though he lived so close to El Toboso. They were going alongconversing in this way, when they saw descending a gap between two highmountains some twenty shepherds, all clad in sheepskins of black wool, andcrowned with garlands which, as afterwards appeared, were, some of them ofyew, some of cypress. Six of the number were carrying a bier covered witha great variety of flowers and branches, on seeing which one of thegoatherds said, &ldquo;Those who come there are the bearers of Chrysostom&rsquo;sbody, and the foot of that mountain is the place where he ordered them tobury him.&rdquo; They therefore made haste to reach the spot, and did so by thetime those who came had laid the bier upon the ground, and four of themwith sharp pickaxes were digging a grave by the side of a hard rock. Theygreeted each other courteously, and then Don Quixote and those whoaccompanied him turned to examine the bier, and on it, covered withflowers, they saw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd, to allappearance of one thirty years of age, and showing even in death that inlife he had been of comely features and gallant bearing. Around him on thebier itself were laid some books, and several papers open and folded; andthose who were looking on as well as those who were opening the grave andall the others who were there preserved a strange silence, until one ofthose who had borne the body said to another, &ldquo;Observe carefully, Ambrosioif this is the place Chrysostom spoke of, since you are anxious that whathe directed in his will should be so strictly complied with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; answered Ambrosio &ldquo;for in it many a time did my poorfriend tell me the story of his hard fortune. Here it was, he told me,that he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race, andhere, too, for the first time he declared to her his passion, ashonourable as it was devoted, and here it was that at last Marcela endedby scorning and rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of his wretchedlife to a close; here, in memory of misfortunes so great, he desired to belaid in the bowels of eternal oblivion.&rdquo; Then turning to Don Quixote andthe travellers he went on to say, &ldquo;That body, sirs, on which you arelooking with compassionate eyes, was the abode of a soul on which Heavenbestowed a vast share of its riches. That is the body of Chrysostom, whowas unrivalled in wit, unequalled in courtesy, unapproached in gentlebearing, a phœnix in friendship, generous without limit, grave withoutarrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, in short, first in all thatconstitutes goodness and second to none in all that makes up misfortune.He loved deeply, he was hated; he adored, he was scorned; he wooed a wildbeast, he pleaded with marble, he pursued the wind, he cried to thewilderness, he served ingratitude, and for reward was made the prey ofdeath in the mid-course of life, cut short by a shepherdess whom he soughtto immortalise in the memory of man, as these papers which you see couldfully prove, had he not commanded me to consign them to the fire afterhaving consigned his body to the earth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their ownerhimself,&rdquo; said Vivaldo, &ldquo;for it is neither right nor proper to do the willof one who enjoins what is wholly unreasonable; it would not have beenreasonable in Augustus Cæsar had he permitted the directions left by thedivine Mantuan in his will to be carried into effect. So that, SeñorAmbrosio while you consign your friend&rsquo;s body to the earth, you should notconsign his writings to oblivion, for if he gave the order in bitternessof heart, it is not right that you should irrationally obey it. On thecontrary, by granting life to those papers, let the cruelty of Marcelalive for ever, to serve as a warning in ages to come to all men to shunand avoid falling into like danger; or I and all of us who have come hereknow already the story of this your love-stricken and heart-broken friend,and we know, too, your friendship, and the cause of his death, and thedirections he gave at the close of his life; from which sad story may begathered how great was the cruelty of Marcela, the love of Chrysostom, andthe loyalty of your friendship, together with the end awaiting those whopursue rashly the path that insane passion opens to their eyes. Last nightwe learned the death of Chrysostom and that he was to be buried here, andout of curiosity and pity we left our direct road and resolved to come andsee with our eyes that which when heard of had so moved our compassion,and in consideration of that compassion and our desire to prove it if wemight by condolence, we beg of you, excellent Ambrosio, or at least I onmy own account entreat you, that instead of burning those papers you allowme to carry away some of them.&rdquo;</p><p>And without waiting for the shepherd&rsquo;s answer, he stretched out his handand took up some of those that were nearest to him; seeing which Ambrosiosaid, &ldquo;Out of courtesy, señor, I will grant your request as to those youhave taken, but it is idle to expect me to abstain from burning theremainder.&rdquo;</p><p>Vivaldo, who was eager to see what the papers contained, opened one ofthem at once, and saw that its title was &ldquo;Lay of Despair.&rdquo;</p><p>Ambrosio hearing it said, &ldquo;That is the last paper the unhappy man wrote;and that you may see, señor, to what an end his misfortunes brought him,read it so that you may be heard, for you will have time enough for thatwhile we are waiting for the grave to be dug.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will do so very willingly,&rdquo; said Vivaldo; and as all the bystanderswere equally eager they gathered round him, and he, reading in a loudvoice, found that it ran as follows.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c13e" id="c13e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c13e.jpg (15K)" src="images/c13e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br/>WHEREIN ARE INSERTED THE DESPAIRING VERSES OF THE DEAD SHEPHERD, TOGETHERWITH OTHER INCIDENTS NOT LOOKED FOR</h3><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c14a" id="c14a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c14a.jpg (172K)" src="images/c14a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c14a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p class="poem">THE LAY OF CHRYSOSTOM<br/><br/>Since thou dost in thy cruelty desire<br/>The ruthless rigour of thy tyranny<br/>From tongue to tongue, from land to land proclaimed,<br/>The very Hell will I constrain to lend<br/>This stricken breast of mine deep notes of woe<br/>To serve my need of fitting utterance.<br/>And as I strive to body forth the tale<br/>Of all I suffer, all that thou hast done,<br/>Forth shall the dread voice roll, and bear along<br/>Shreds from my vitals torn for greater pain.<br/>Then listen, not to dulcet harmony,<br/>But to a discord wrung by mad despair<br/>Out of this bosom&rsquo;s depths of bitterness,<br/>To ease my heart and plant a sting in thine.<br/><br/>The lion&rsquo;s roar, the fierce wolf&rsquo;s savage howl,<br/>The horrid hissing of the scaly snake,<br/>The awesome cries of monsters yet unnamed,<br/>The crow&rsquo;s ill-boding croak, the hollow moan<br/>Of wild winds wrestling with the restless sea,<br/>The wrathful bellow of the vanquished bull,<br/>The plaintive sobbing of the widowed dove,<br/>The envied owl&rsquo;s sad note, the wail of woe<br/>That rises from the dreary choir of Hell,<br/>Commingled in one sound, confusing sense,<br/>Let all these come to aid my soul&rsquo;s complaint,<br/>For pain like mine demands new modes of song.<br/><br/>No echoes of that discord shall be heard<br/>Where Father Tagus rolls, or on the banks<br/>Of olive-bordered Betis; to the rocks<br/>Or in deep caverns shall my plaint be told,<br/>And by a lifeless tongue in living words;<br/>Or in dark valleys or on lonely shores,<br/>Where neither foot of man nor sunbeam falls;<br/>Or in among the poison-breathing swarms<br/>Of monsters nourished by the sluggish Nile.<br/>For, though it be to solitudes remote<br/>The hoarse vague echoes of my sorrows sound<br/>Thy matchless cruelty, my dismal fate<br/>Shall carry them to all the spacious world.<br/><br/>Disdain hath power to kill, and patience dies<br/>Slain by suspicion, be it false or true;<br/>And deadly is the force of jealousy;<br/>Long absence makes of life a dreary void;<br/>No hope of happiness can give repose<br/>To him that ever fears to be forgot;<br/>And death, inevitable, waits in hall.<br/>But I, by some strange miracle, live on<br/>A prey to absence, jealousy, disdain;<br/>Racked by suspicion as by certainty;<br/>Forgotten, left to feed my flame alone.<br/>And while I suffer thus, there comes no ray<br/>Of hope to gladden me athwart the gloom;<br/>Nor do I look for it in my despair;<br/>But rather clinging to a cureless woe,<br/>All hope do I abjure for evermore.<br/><br/>Can there be hope where fear is?

Those who had never till then beheld her gazedupon her in wonder and silence, and those who were accustomed to see herwere not less amazed than those who had never seen her before. But theinstant Ambrosio saw her he addressed her, with manifest indignation:</p><p>&ldquo;Art thou come, by chance, cruel basilisk of these mountains, to see if inthy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched being thycruelty has robbed of life; or is it to exult over the cruel work of thyhumours that thou art come; or like another pitiless Nero to look downfrom that height upon the ruin of his Rome in embers; or in thy arroganceto trample on this ill-fated corpse, as the ungrateful daughter trampledon her father Tarquin&rsquo;s? Tell us quickly for what thou art come, or whatit is thou wouldst have, for, as I know the thoughts of Chrysostom neverfailed to obey thee in life, I will make all these who call themselves hisfriends obey thee, though he be dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I come not, Ambrosio for any of the purposes thou hast named,&rdquo; repliedMarcela, &ldquo;but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are all thosewho blame me for their sorrow and for Chrysostom&rsquo;s death; and therefore Iask all of you that are here to give me your attention, for it will not takemuch time or many words to bring the truth home to persons of sense.Heaven has made me, so you say, beautiful, and so much so that in spite ofyourselves my beauty leads you to love me; and for the love you show meyou say, and even urge, that I am bound to love you. By that naturalunderstanding which God has given me I know that everything beautifulattracts love, but I cannot see how, by reason of being loved, that whichis loved for its beauty is bound to love that which loves it; besides, itmay happen that the lover of that which is beautiful may be ugly, andugliness being detestable, it is very absurd to say, &ldquo;I love thee becausethou art beautiful, thou must love me though I be ugly.&rdquo; But supposing thebeauty equal on both sides, it does not follow that the inclinations mustbe therefore alike, for it is not every beauty that excites love, some butpleasing the eye without winning the affection; and if every sort ofbeauty excited love and won the heart, the will would wander vaguely toand fro unable to make choice of any; for as there is an infinity ofbeautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations, and truelove, I have heard it said, is indivisible, and must be voluntary and notcompelled. If this be so, as I believe it to be, why do you desire me tobend my will by force, for no other reason but that you say you love me?Nay&mdash;tell me&mdash;had Heaven made me ugly, as it has made mebeautiful, could I with justice complain of you for not loving me?Moreover, you must remember that the beauty I possess was no choice ofmine, for, be it what it may, Heaven of its bounty gave it me without myasking or choosing it; and as the viper, though it kills with it, does notdeserve to be blamed for the poison it carries, as it is a gift of nature,neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful; for beauty in a modestwoman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword; the one does not burn,the other does not cut, those who do not come too near. Honour and virtueare the ornaments of the mind, without which the body, though it be so,has no right to pass for beautiful; but if modesty is one of the virtuesthat specially lend a grace and charm to mind and body, why should she whois loved for her beauty part with it to gratify one who for his pleasurealone strives with all his might and energy to rob her of it? I was bornfree, and that I might live in freedom I chose the solitude of the fields;in the trees of the mountains I find society, the clear waters of thebrooks are my mirrors, and to the trees and waters I make known mythoughts and charms. I am a fire afar off, a sword laid aside. Those whomI have inspired with love by letting them see me, I have by wordsundeceived, and if their longings live on hope&mdash;and I have given noneto Chrysostom or to any other&mdash;it cannot justly be said that thedeath of any is my doing, for it was rather his own obstinacy than mycruelty that killed him; and if it be made a charge against me that hiswishes were honourable, and that therefore I was bound to yield to them, Ianswer that when on this very spot where now his grave is made he declaredto me his purity of purpose, I told him that mine was to live in perpetualsolitude, and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits of myretirement and the spoils of my beauty; and if, after this open avowal, hechose to persist against hope and steer against the wind, what wonder isit that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation? If I hadencouraged him, I should be false; if I had gratified him, I should haveacted against my own better resolution and purpose. He was persistent inspite of warning, he despaired without being hated. Bethink you now if itbe reasonable that his suffering should be laid to my charge. Let him whohas been deceived complain, let him give way to despair whose encouragedhopes have proved vain, let him flatter himself whom I shall entice, lethim boast whom I shall receive; but let not him call me cruel or homicideto whom I make no promise, upon whom I practise no deception, whom Ineither entice nor receive. It has not been so far the will of Heaven thatI should love by fate, and to expect me to love by choice is idle. Letthis general declaration serve for each of my suitors on his own account,and let it be understood from this time forth that if anyone dies for meit is not of jealousy or misery he dies, for she who loves no one can giveno cause for jealousy to any, and candour is not to be confounded withscorn. Let him who calls me wild beast and basilisk, leave me alone assomething noxious and evil; let him who calls me ungrateful, withhold hisservice; who calls me wayward, seek not my acquaintance; who calls mecruel, pursue me not; for this wild beast, this basilisk, this ungrateful,cruel, wayward being has no kind of desire to seek, serve, know, or followthem. If Chrysostom&rsquo;s impatience and violent passion killed him, whyshould my modest behaviour and circumspection be blamed? If I preserve mypurity in the society of the trees, why should he who would have mepreserve it among men, seek to rob me of it? I have, as you know, wealthof my own, and I covet not that of others; my taste is for freedom, and Ihave no relish for constraint; I neither love nor hate anyone; I do notdeceive this one or court that, or trifle with one or play with another.The modest converse of the shepherd girls of these hamlets and the care ofmy goats are my recreations; my desires are bounded by these mountains,and if they ever wander hence it is to contemplate the beauty of theheavens, steps by which the soul travels to its primeval abode.&rdquo;</p><p>With these words, and not waiting to hear a reply, she turned and passedinto the thickest part of a wood that was hard by, leaving all who werethere lost in admiration as much of her good sense as of her beauty. Some&mdash;thosewounded by the irresistible shafts launched by her bright eyes&mdash;madeas though they would follow her, heedless of the frank declaration theyhad heard; seeing which, and deeming this a fitting occasion for theexercise of his chivalry in aid of distressed damsels, Don Quixote, layinghis hand on the hilt of his sword, exclaimed in a loud and distinct voice:</p><p>&ldquo;Let no one, whatever his rank or condition, dare to follow the beautifulMarcela, under pain of incurring my fierce indignation. She has shown byclear and satisfactory arguments that little or no fault is to be foundwith her for the death of Chrysostom, and also how far she is fromyielding to the wishes of any of her lovers, for which reason, instead ofbeing followed and persecuted, she should in justice be honoured andesteemed by all the good people of the world, for she shows that she isthe only woman in it that holds to such a virtuous resolution.&rdquo;</p><p>Whether it was because of the threats of Don Quixote, or because Ambrosiotold them to fulfil their duty to their good friend, none of the shepherdsmoved or stirred from the spot until, having finished the grave and burnedChrysostom&rsquo;s papers, they laid his body in it, not without many tears fromthose who stood by. They closed the grave with a heavy stone until a slabwas ready which Ambrosio said he meant to have prepared, with an epitaphwhich was to be to this effect:</p><p class="poem">Beneath the stone before your eyes<br/>The body of a lover lies;<br/>In life he was a shepherd swain,<br/>In death a victim to disdain.<br/>Ungrateful, cruel, coy, and fair,<br/>Was she that drove him to despair,<br/>And Love hath made her his ally<br/>For spreading wide his tyranny.</p><p class="noindent">They then strewed upon the grave a profusion of flowers and branches, andall expressing their condolence with his friend Ambrosio, took their leave.Vivaldo and his companion did the same; and Don Quixote bade farewell tohis hosts and to the travellers, who pressed him to come with them toSeville, as being such a convenient place for finding adventures, for theypresented themselves in every street and round every corner oftener thananywhere else. Don Quixote thanked them for their advice and for thedisposition they showed to do him a favour, and said that for the presenthe would not, and must not go to Seville until he had cleared all thesemountains of highwaymen and robbers, of whom report said they were full.Seeing his good intention, the travellers were unwilling to press himfurther, and once more bidding him farewell, they left him and pursuedtheir journey, in the course of which they did not fail to discuss thestory of Marcela and Chrysostom as well as the madness of Don Quixote. He,on his part, resolved to go in quest of the shepherdess Marcela, and makeoffer to her of all the service he could render her; but things did notfall out with him as he expected, according to what is related in thecourse of this veracious history, of which the Second Part ends here.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c14e" id="c14e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c14e.jpg (31K)" src="images/c14e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br/>IN WHICH IS RELATED THE UNFORTUNATE ADVENTURE THAT DON QUIXOTE FELL INWITH WHEN HE FELL OUT WITH CERTAIN HEARTLESS YANGUESANS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c15a" id="c15a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c15a.jpg (81K)" src="images/c15a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c15a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The sage Cid Hamete Benengeli relates that as soon as Don Quixote tookleave of his hosts and all who had been present at the burial ofChrysostom, he and his squire passed into the same wood which they hadseen the shepherdess Marcela enter, and after having wandered for morethan two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her,they came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside which rana pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass there thehours of the noontide heat, which by this time was beginning to come onoppressively. Don Quixote and Sancho dismounted, and turning Rocinante andthe ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in abundance, theyransacked the alforjas, and without any ceremony very peacefully andsociably master and man made their repast on what they found in them.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c15b" id="c15b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c15b.jpg (376K)" src="images/c15b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c15b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Sancho had not thought it worth while to hobble Rocinante, feeling sure,from what he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence, that allthe mares in the Cordova pastures would not lead him into an impropriety.Chance, however, and the devil, who is not always asleep, so ordained itthat feeding in this valley there was a drove of Galician ponies belongingto certain Yanguesan carriers, whose way it is to take their midday restwith their teams in places and spots where grass and water abound; andthat where Don Quixote chanced to be suited the Yanguesans&rsquo; purpose verywell. It so happened, then, that Rocinante took a fancy to disport himselfwith their ladyships the ponies, and abandoning his usual gait anddemeanour as he scented them, he, without asking leave of his master, gotup a briskish little trot and hastened to make known his wishes to them;they, however, it seemed, preferred their pasture to him, and received himwith their heels and teeth to such effect that they soon broke his girthsand left him naked without a saddle to cover him; but what must have beenworse to him was that the carriers, seeing the violence he was offering totheir mares, came running up armed with stakes, and so belaboured him thatthey brought him sorely battered to the ground.</p><p>By this time Don Quixote and Sancho, who had witnessed the drubbing ofRocinante, came up panting, and said Don Quixote to Sancho:</p><p>&ldquo;So far as I can see, friend Sancho, these are not knights but base folkof low birth: I mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in takingdue vengeance for the insult offered to Rocinante before our eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What the devil vengeance can we take,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;if they are morethan twenty, and we no more than two, or, indeed, perhaps not more thanone and a half?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I count for a hundred,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, and without more words hedrew his sword and attacked the Yanguesans and excited and impelled by theexample of his master, Sancho did the same; and to begin with, Don Quixotedelivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather jerkin hewore, together with a great portion of his shoulder. The Yanguesans,seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were so many,betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into the middlethey began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at the secondblow they brought Sancho to the ground, and Don Quixote fared the sameway, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing, and fate willedit that he should fall at the feet of Rocinante, who had not yet risen;whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can pound in angry boorishhands.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c15c" id="c15c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c15c.jpg (362K)" src="images/c15c.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c15c.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Then, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all the hastethey could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving the twoadventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.</p><p>Sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his masterhe called to him in a weak and doleful voice, &ldquo;Señor Don Quixote, ah,Señor Don Quixote!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What wouldst thou, brother Sancho?&rdquo; answered Don Quixote in the samefeeble suffering tone as Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;I would like, if it were possible,&rdquo; answered Sancho Panza, &ldquo;your worshipto give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas, if it bethat you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for broken bones aswell as for wounds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?&rdquo; saidDon Quixote; &ldquo;but I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of aknight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise, Imean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its cunning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of ourfeet?&rdquo; answered Sancho Panza.</p><p>&ldquo;For myself I must say I cannot guess how many,&rdquo; said the batteredknight Don Quixote; &ldquo;but I take all the blame upon myself, for I had nobusiness to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights likemyself, and so I believe that in punishment for having transgressed the laws ofchivalry the God of battles has permitted this chastisement to be administeredto me; for which reason, brother Sancho, it is well thou shouldst receive ahint on the matter which I am now about to mention to thee, for it is of muchimportance to the welfare of both of us. It is that when thou shalt see rabbleof this sort offering us insult thou art not to wait till I draw sword againstthem, for I shall not do so at all; but do thou draw sword and chastise them tothy heart&rsquo;s content, and if any knights come to their aid and defence Iwill take care to defend thee and assail them with all my might; and thou hastalready seen by a thousand signs and proofs what the might of this strong armof mine is equal to&rdquo;&mdash;so uplifted had the poor gentleman becomethrough the victory over the stout Biscayan.</p><p>But Sancho did not so fully approve of his master&rsquo;s admonition as to letit pass without saying in reply, &ldquo;Señor, I am a man of peace, meek andquiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife andchildren to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to yourworship, as it cannot be a mandate, that on no account will I draw swordeither against clown or against knight, and that here before God I forgivethe insults that have been offered me, whether they have been, are, orshall be offered me by high or low, rich or poor, noble or commoner, notexcepting any rank or condition whatsoever.&rdquo;</p><p>To all which his master said in reply, &ldquo;I wish I had breath enough tospeak somewhat easily, and that the pain I feel on this side would abateso as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the mistake thou makest. Come now,sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto so adverse, should turn inour favour, filling the sails of our desires so that safely and withoutimpediment we put into port in some one of those islands I have promisedthee, how would it be with thee if on winning it I made thee lord of it?Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible through not being a knight norhaving any desire to be one, nor possessing the courage nor the will toavenge insults or defend thy lordship; for thou must know that in newlyconquered kingdoms and provinces the minds of the inhabitants are never soquiet nor so well disposed to the new lord that there is no fear of theirmaking some move to change matters once more, and try, as they say, whatchance may do for them; so it is essential that the new possessor shouldhave good sense to enable him to govern, and valour to attack and defendhimself, whatever may befall him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In what has now befallen us,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have been wellpleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of,but I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters than forarguments. See if your worship can get up, and let us help Rocinante,though he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause of all thisthrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him to be avirtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say right that ittakes a long time to come to know people, and that there is nothing surein this life. Who would have said that, after such mighty slashes as yourworship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was coming, travelling postand at the very heels of them, such a great storm of sticks as has fallenupon our shoulders?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And yet thine, Sancho,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;ought to be used to suchsqualls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plain theymust feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were not that Iimagine&mdash;why do I say imagine?&mdash;know of a certainty that allthese annoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms,I would lay me down here to die of pure vexation.&rdquo;</p><p>To this the squire replied, &ldquo;Señor, as these mishaps are what one reaps ofchivalry, tell me if they happen very often, or if they have their ownfixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that after twoharvests we shall be no good for the third, unless God in his infinitemercy helps us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Know, friend Sancho,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;that the life ofknights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, and neithermore nor less is it within immediate possibility for knights-errant tobecome kings and emperors, as experience has shown in the case of manydifferent knights with whose histories I am thoroughly acquainted; and Icould tell thee now, if the pain would let me, of some who simply by mightof arm have risen to the high stations I have mentioned; and those same,both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes and miseries; forthe valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortal enemyArcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding himcaptive, gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his horsewhile tied to one of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is acertain recondite author of no small authority who says that the Knight ofPhœbus, being caught in a certain pitfall, which opened under his feet ina certain castle, on falling found himself bound hand and foot in a deeppit underground, where they administered to him one of those things theycall clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him; and ifhe had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friendof his, it would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I may wellsuffer in company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignitieswhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have theeknow, Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chanceto be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law ofthe duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes anotherwith the last which he has in his hand, though it be in fact a piece ofwood, it cannot be said for that reason that he whom he struck with it hasbeen cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imagine that because we havebeen drubbed in this affray we have therefore suffered any indignity; forthe arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, were nothing morethan their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carriedrapier, sword, or dagger.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They gave me no time to see that much,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;for hardly hadI laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders withtheir sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and thestrength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinkingof whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me nouneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they will remain asdeeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;thatthere is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no painwhich death does not remove.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what greater misfortune can there be,&rdquo; replied Panza, &ldquo;than the onethat waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If ourmishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters, itwould not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all the plasters ina hospital almost won&rsquo;t be enough to put us right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean todo,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seemsto me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of thepoor beast.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is nothing wonderful in that,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;since he is aknight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come offscot-free where we come out scotched.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring reliefto it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;I say so because this little beast may nowsupply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I maybe cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour tobe so mounted, for I remember having read how the good old Silenus, thetutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he entered the cityof the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on a handsome ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says,&rdquo; answeredSancho, &ldquo;but there is a great difference between going mounted and goingslung like a sack of manure.&rdquo;</p><p>To which Don Quixote replied, &ldquo;Wounds received in battle confer honourinstead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as Itold thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thybeast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere nightcome on and surprise us in these wilds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And yet I have heard your worship say,&rdquo; observed Panza, &ldquo;that it is verymeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that theyesteem it very good fortune.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;when they cannot help it, or when they arein love; and so true is this that there have been knights who haveremained two years on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all theinclemencies of heaven, without their ladies knowing anything of it; andone of these was Amadis, when, under the name of Beltenebros, he took uphis abode on the Peña Pobre for&mdash;I know not if it was eight years oreight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; at any rate hestayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the Princess Orianahad against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste before amishap like Rocinante&rsquo;s befalls the ass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The very devil would be in it in that case,&rdquo; said Sancho; and letting offthirty &ldquo;ohs,&rdquo; and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions andexecrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him there, he raisedhimself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power to bringhimself upright, but with all his pains he saddled his ass, who too hadgone astray somewhat, yielding to the excessive licence of the day; henext raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had he possessed a tongue tocomplain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his master would havebeen behind him.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c15d" id="c15d"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c15d.jpg (329K)" src="images/c15d.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c15d.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinantewith a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he proceeded moreor less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high road might be;and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to better,he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and on it heperceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of Don Quixotemust needs be a castle.

Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he hadfallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeperhad a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her calling commonlyhave, for she was by nature kind-hearted and felt for the sufferings ofher neighbours, so she at once set about tending Don Quixote, and made heryoung daughter, a very comely girl, help her in taking care of her guest.There was besides in the inn, as servant, an Asturian lass with a broadface, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of one eye and not very sound in theother. The elegance of her shape, to be sure, made up for all her defects;she did not measure seven palms from head to foot, and her shoulders,which overweighted her somewhat, made her contemplate the ground more thanshe liked. This graceful lass, then, helped the young girl, and the twomade up a very bad bed for Don Quixote in a garret that showed evidentsigns of having formerly served for many years as a straw-loft, in whichthere was also quartered a carrier whose bed was placed a little beyondour Don Quixote&rsquo;s, and, though only made of the pack-saddles and cloths ofhis mules, had much the advantage of it, as Don Quixote&rsquo;s consisted simplyof four rough boards on two not very even trestles, a mattress, that forthinness might have passed for a quilt, full of pellets which, were theynot seen through the rents to be wool, would to the touch have seemedpebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and a coverletthe threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without missingone in the reckoning.</p><p>On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess andher daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, whileMaritornes&mdash;for that was the name of the Asturian&mdash;held thelight for them, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how fullof wheals Don Quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more thelook of blows than of a fall.</p><p>It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points andprojections, and that each of them had left its mark. &ldquo;Pray, señora,&rdquo; headded, &ldquo;manage to save some tow, as there will be no want of someone touse it, for my loins too are rather sore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you must have fallen too,&rdquo; said the hostess.</p><p>&ldquo;I did not fall,&rdquo; said Sancho Panza, &ldquo;but from the shock I got at seeingmy master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousandthwacks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That may well be,&rdquo; said the young girl, &ldquo;for it has many a time happenedto me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming tothe ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak andshaken as if I had really fallen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is the point, señora,&rdquo; replied Sancho Panza, &ldquo;that I withoutdreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself withscarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How is the gentleman called?&rdquo; asked Maritornes the Asturian.</p><p>&ldquo;Don Quixote of La Mancha,&rdquo; answered Sancho Panza, &ldquo;and he is aknight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen inthe world this long time past.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is a knight-adventurer?&rdquo; said the lass.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you so new in the world as not to know?&rdquo; answered Sancho Panza.&ldquo;Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thingthat in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the mostmiserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two orthree crowns of kingdoms to give his squire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then how is it,&rdquo; said the hostess, &ldquo;that belonging to so good a master asthis, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is too soon yet,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;for we have only been a monthgoing in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that canbe called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked foranother thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well ofthis wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would notchange my hopes for the best title in Spain.&rdquo;</p><p>To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, andsitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the handhe said to her, &ldquo;Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate inhaving in this castle of yours sheltered my person, which is such that ifI do not myself praise it, it is because of what is commonly said, thatself-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you who I am. I only tellyou that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on my memory the service youhave rendered me in order to tender you my gratitude while life shall lastme; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled and subject to itslaws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name between my teeth,but that those of this lovely damsel might be the masters of my liberty.&rdquo;</p><p>The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened inbewilderment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood aboutas much of them as if he had been talking Greek, though they couldperceive they were all meant for expressions of good-will andblandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind of language, theystared at him and wondered to themselves, for he seemed to them a man of adifferent sort from those they were used to, and thanking him in pothousephrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gave herattention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.</p><p>The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night,and she had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and thefamily asleep she would come in search of him and meet his wishesunreservedly. And it is said of this good lass that she never madepromises of the kind without fulfilling them, even though she made them ina forest and without any witness present, for she plumed herself greatlyon being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an employment asservant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and ill-luck had broughther to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched, rickety bed of DonQuixote stood first in the middle of this star-lit stable, and closebeside it Sancho made his, which merely consisted of a rush mat and ablanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas rather than of wool.Next to these two beds was that of the carrier, made up, as has been said,of the pack-saddles and all the trappings of the two best mules he had,though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump, and in prime condition,for he was one of the rich carriers of Arévalo, according to the author ofthis history, who particularly mentions this carrier because he knew himvery well, and they even say was in some degree a relation of his; besideswhich Cid Hamete Benengeli was a historian of great research and accuracyin all things, as is very evident since he would not pass over in silencethose that have been already mentioned, however trifling and insignificantthey might be, an example that might be followed by those grave historianswho relate transactions so curtly and briefly that we hardly get a tasteof them, all the substance of the work being left in the inkstand fromcarelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thousand blessings on theauthor of &ldquo;Tablante de Ricamonte&rdquo; and that of the other book in which thedeeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minuteness theydescribe everything!</p><p>To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given themtheir second feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles andlay waiting for his conscientious Maritornes. Sancho was by this timeplastered and had lain down, and though he strove to sleep the pain of hisribs would not let him, while Don Quixote with the pain of his had hiseyes as wide open as a hare&rsquo;s.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c16b" id="c16b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c16b.jpg (333K)" src="images/c16b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c16b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The inn was all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no lightexcept that given by a lantern that hung burning in the middle of thegateway. This strange stillness, and the thoughts, always present to ourknight&rsquo;s mind, of the incidents described at every turn in the books thatwere the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to his imagination asextraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was that hefancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said,all the inns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the daughterof the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, wonby his high-bred bearing, had fallen in love with him, and had promised tocome to his bed for a while that night without the knowledge of herparents; and holding all this fantasy that he had constructed as solidfact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the perilous risk which hisvirtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in his heart to commit notreason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even though the queen Guinevereherself and the dame Quintañona should present themselves before him.</p><p>While he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the hour&mdash;anunlucky one for him&mdash;arrived for the Asturian to come, who in hersmock, with bare feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, withnoiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the three werequartered, in quest of the carrier; but scarcely had she gained the doorwhen Don Quixote perceived her, and sitting up in his bed in spite of hisplasters and the pain of his ribs, he stretched out his arms to receivehis beauteous damsel. The Asturian, who went all doubled up and in silencewith her hands before her feeling for her lover, encountered the arms ofDon Quixote, who grasped her tightly by the wrist, and drawing her towardshim, while she dared not utter a word, made her sit down on the bed. Hethen felt her smock, and although it was of sackcloth it appeared to himto be of the finest and softest silk: on her wrists she wore some glassbeads, but to him they had the sheen of precious Orient pearls: her hair,which in some measure resembled a horse&rsquo;s mane, he rated as threads of thebrightest gold of Araby, whose refulgence dimmed the sun himself: herbreath, which no doubt smelt of yesterday&rsquo;s stale salad, seemed to him todiffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her mouth; and, in short, he drewher portrait in his imagination with the same features and in the samestyle as that which he had seen in his books of the other princesses who,smitten by love, came with all the adornments that are here set down, tosee the sorely wounded knight; and so great was the poor gentleman&rsquo;sblindness that neither touch, nor smell, nor anything else about the goodlass that would have made any but a carrier vomit, were enough toundeceive him; on the contrary, he was persuaded he had the goddess ofbeauty in his arms, and holding her firmly in his grasp he went on to sayin low, tender voice:</p><p>&ldquo;Would that I found myself, lovely and exalted lady, in a position torepay such a favour as that which you, by the sight of your great beauty, havegranted me; but fortune, which is never weary of persecuting the good, haschosen to place me upon this bed, where I lie so bruised and broken that thoughmy inclination would gladly comply with yours it is impossible; besides, tothis impossibility another yet greater is to be added, which is the faith thatI have pledged to the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole lady of my most secretthoughts; and were it not that this stood in the way I should not be soinsensible a knight as to miss the happy opportunity which your great goodnesshas offered me.&rdquo;</p><p>Maritornes was fretting and sweating at finding herself held so fast byDon Quixote, and not understanding or heeding the words he addressed toher, she strove without speaking to free herself. The worthy carrier,whose unholy thoughts kept him awake, was aware of his doxy the moment sheentered the door, and was listening attentively to all Don Quixote said;and jealous that the Asturian should have broken her word with him foranother, drew nearer to Don Quixote&rsquo;s bed and stood still to see whatwould come of this talk which he could not understand; but when heperceived the wench struggling to get free and Don Quixote striving tohold her, not relishing the joke he raised his arm and delivered such aterrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knight that he bathed allhis mouth in blood, and not content with this he mounted on his ribs andwith his feet tramped all over them at a pace rather smarter than a trot.The bed which was somewhat crazy and not very firm on its feet, unable tosupport the additional weight of the carrier, came to the ground, and atthe mighty crash of this the innkeeper awoke and at once concluded that itmust be some brawl of Maritornes&rsquo;, because after calling loudly to her hegot no answer. With this suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp hastenedto the quarter where he had heard the disturbance. The wench, seeing thather master was coming and knowing that his temper was terrible, frightenedand panic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept, andcrouching upon it made a ball of herself.</p><p>The innkeeper came in exclaiming, &ldquo;Where art thou, strumpet? Of coursethis is some of thy work.&rdquo; At this Sancho awoke, and feeling this massalmost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began to distributefisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell upon Maritornes, who,irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paid back so many inreturn to Sancho that she woke him up in spite of himself. He then,finding himself so handled, by whom he knew not, raising himself up aswell as he could, grappled with Maritornes, and he and she between thembegan the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world. The carrier,however, perceiving by the light of the innkeeper candle how it fared withhis ladylove, quitting Don Quixote, ran to bring her the help she needed;and the innkeeper did the same but with a different intention, for his wasto chastise the lass, as he believed that beyond a doubt she alone was thecause of all the harmony. And so, as the saying is, cat to rat, rat torope, rope to stick, the carrier pounded Sancho, Sancho the lass, she him,and the innkeeper her, and all worked away so briskly that they did notgive themselves a moment&rsquo;s rest; and the best of it was that theinnkeeper&rsquo;s lamp went out, and as they were left in the dark they all laidon one upon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a soundspot left where a hand could light.</p><p>It so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn a caudrilleroof what they call the Old Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who, also hearingthe extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staff and the tin casewith his warrants, and made his way in the dark into the room crying:&ldquo;Hold! in the name of the Jurisdiction! Hold! in the name of the HolyBrotherhood!&rdquo;</p><p>The first that he came upon was the pummelled Don Quixote, who laystretched senseless on his back upon his broken-down bed, and, his handfalling on the beard as he felt about, he continued to cry, &ldquo;Help for theJurisdiction!&rdquo; but perceiving that he whom he had laid hold of did notmove or stir, he concluded that he was dead and that those in the roomwere his murderers, and with this suspicion he raised his voice stillhigher, calling out, &ldquo;Shut the inn gate; see that no one goes out; theyhave killed a man here!&rdquo; This cry startled them all, and each dropped thecontest at the point at which the voice reached him. The innkeeperretreated to his room, the carrier to his pack-saddles, the lass to hercrib; the unlucky Don Quixote and Sancho alone were unable to move fromwhere they were. The cuadrillero on this let go Don Quixote&rsquo;s beard, andwent out to look for a light to search for and apprehend the culprits; butnot finding one, as the innkeeper had purposely extinguished the lanternon retreating to his room, he was compelled to have recourse to thehearth, where after much time and trouble he lit another lamp.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c16e" id="c16e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c16e.jpg (32K)" src="images/c16e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br/>IN WHICH ARE CONTAINED THE INNUMERABLE TROUBLES WHICH THE BRAVE DONQUIXOTE AND HIS GOOD SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA ENDURED IN THE INN, WHICH TO HISMISFORTUNE HE TOOK TO BE A CASTLE</h3><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c17a" id="c17a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c17a.jpg (87K)" src="images/c17a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c17a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>By this time Don Quixote had recovered from his swoon; and in the sametone of voice in which he had called to his squire the day before when helay stretched &ldquo;in the vale of the stakes,&rdquo; he began calling to him now,&ldquo;Sancho, my friend, art thou asleep? sleepest thou, friend Sancho?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can I sleep, curses on it!&rdquo; returned Sancho discontentedly andbitterly, &ldquo;when it is plain that all the devils have been at me thisnight?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou mayest well believe that,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;because, either Iknow little, or this castle is enchanted, for thou must know&mdash;butthis that I am now about to tell thee thou must swear to keep secret untilafter my death.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; answered Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;I say so,&rdquo; continued Don Quixote, &ldquo;because I hate taking away anyone&rsquo;sgood name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;that I swear to hold my tongue about it till theend of your worship&rsquo;s days, and God grant I may be able to let it outto-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do I do thee such injuries, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that thou wouldstsee me dead so soon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is not for that,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;but because I hate keeping thingslong, and I don&rsquo;t want them to grow rotten with me from over-keeping.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;I have more confidence in thy affectionand good nature; and so I would have thee know that this night therebefell me one of the strangest adventures that I could describe, and torelate it to thee briefly thou must know that a little while ago thedaughter of the lord of this castle came to me, and that she is the mostelegant and beautiful damsel that could be found in the wide world.

I will only tell theethat, either fate being envious of so great a boon placed in my hands bygood fortune, or perhaps (and this is more probable) this castle being, asI have already said, enchanted, at the time when I was engaged in thesweetest and most amorous discourse with her, there came, without myseeing or knowing whence it came, a hand attached to some arm of some hugegiant, that planted such a cuff on my jaws that I have them all bathed inblood, and then pummelled me in such a way that I am in a worse plightthan yesterday when the carriers, on account of Rocinante&rsquo;s misbehaviour,inflicted on us the injury thou knowest of; whence conjecture that theremust be some enchanted Moor guarding the treasure of this damsel&rsquo;s beauty,and that it is not for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not for me either,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for more than four hundred Moors haveso thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes and fancy-breadto it. But tell me, señor, what do you call this excellent and rareadventure that has left us as we are left now? Though your worship was notso badly off, having in your arms that incomparable beauty you spoke of;but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacks I think I had in all mylife? Unlucky me and the mother that bore me! for I am not a knight-errantand never expect to be one, and of all the mishaps, the greater part fallsto my share.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then thou hast been thrashed too?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say so? worse luck to my line!&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Be not distressed, friend,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for I will now make theprecious balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of aneye.&rdquo;</p><p>By this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and camein to see the man that he thought had been killed; and as Sancho caughtsight of him at the door, seeing him coming in his shirt, with a cloth onhis head, and a lamp in his hand, and a very forbidding countenance, hesaid to his master, &ldquo;Señor, can it be that this is the enchanted Moorcoming back to give us more castigation if there be anything still left inthe ink-bottle?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It cannot be the Moor,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;for those underenchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,&rdquo; saidSancho; &ldquo;if not, let my shoulders speak to the point.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mine could speak too,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;but that is not a sufficientreason for believing that what we see is the enchanted Moor.&rdquo;</p><p>The officer came up, and finding them engaged in such a peacefulconversation, stood amazed; though Don Quixote, to be sure, still lay onhis back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters. The officerturned to him and said, &ldquo;Well, how goes it, good man?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would speak more politely if I were you,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;is itthe way of this country to address knights-errant in that style, youbooby?&rdquo;</p><p>The cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such asorry-looking individual, lost his temper, and raising the lamp full ofoil, smote Don Quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave him abadly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, and SanchoPanza said, &ldquo;That is certainly the enchanted Moor, Señor, and he keeps thetreasure for others, and for us only the cuffs and lamp-whacks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the truth,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;and there is no use introubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry orvexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find noone on whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thoucanst, and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him to give me alittle oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam, forindeed I believe I have great need of it now, because I am losing muchblood from the wound that phantom gave me.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho got up with pain enough in his bones, and went after the innkeeperin the dark, and meeting the officer, who was looking to see what hadbecome of his enemy, he said to him, &ldquo;Señor, whoever you are, do us thefavour and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt, and wine, forit is wanted to cure one of the best knights-errant on earth, who lies onyonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted Moor that is in thisinn.&rdquo;</p><p>When the officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a man out ofhis senses, and as day was now beginning to break, he opened the inn gate,and calling the host, he told him what this good man wanted. The hostfurnished him with what he required, and Sancho brought it to Don Quixote,who, with his hand to his head, was bewailing the pain of the blow of thelamp, which had done him no more harm than raising a couple of ratherlarge lumps, and what he fancied blood was only the sweat that flowed fromhim in his sufferings during the late storm. To be brief, he took thematerials, of which he made a compound, mixing them all and boiling them agood while until it seemed to him they had come to perfection. He thenasked for some vial to pour it into, and as there was not one in the inn,he decided on putting it into a tin oil-bottle or flask of which the hostmade him a free gift; and over the flask he repeated more than eightypaternosters and as many more ave-marias, salves, and credos, accompanyingeach word with a cross by way of benediction, at all which there werepresent Sancho, the innkeeper, and the cuadrillero; for the carrier wasnow peacefully engaged in attending to the comfort of his mules.</p><p>This being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial himself, on thespot, of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he considered it, and sohe drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and remainedin the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely had he donedrinking when he began to vomit in such a way that nothing was left in hisstomach, and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he broke into a profusesweat, on account of which he bade them cover him up and leave him alone.They did so, and he lay sleeping more than three hours, at the end ofwhich he awoke and felt very great bodily relief and so much ease from hisbruises that he thought himself quite cured, and verily believed he hadhit upon the balsam of Fierabras; and that with this remedy he mightthenceforward, without any fear, face any kind of destruction, battle, orcombat, however perilous it might be.</p><p>Sancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous,begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which was no smallquantity. Don Quixote consented, and he, taking it with both hands, ingood faith and with a better will, gulped down and drained off very littleless than his master. But the fact is, that the stomach of poor Sancho wasof necessity not so delicate as that of his master, and so, beforevomiting, he was seized with such gripings and retchings, and such sweatsand faintness, that verily and truly he believed his last hour had come,and finding himself so racked and tormented he cursed the balsam and thethief that had given it to him.</p><p>Don Quixote seeing him in this state said, &ldquo;It is my belief, Sancho, thatthis mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I am persuadedthis liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If your worship knew that,&rdquo; returned Sancho&mdash;&ldquo;woe betide me and allmy kindred!&mdash;why did you let me taste it?&rdquo;</p><p>At this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began todischarge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he hadthrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit fornothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms andconvulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his end hadcome. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the end ofwhich he was left, not like his master, but so weak and exhausted that hecould not stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as has been said, felt himselfrelieved and well, was eager to take his departure at once in quest ofadventures, as it seemed to him that all the time he loitered there was afraud upon the world and those in it who stood in need of his help andprotection, all the more when he had the security and confidence hisbalsam afforded him; and so, urged by this impulse, he saddled Rocinantehimself and put the pack-saddle on his squire&rsquo;s beast, whom likewise hehelped to dress and mount the ass; after which he mounted his horse andturning to a corner of the inn he laid hold of a pike that stood there, toserve him by way of a lance. All that were in the inn, who were more thantwenty persons, stood watching him; the innkeeper&rsquo;s daughter was likewiseobserving him, and he too never took his eyes off her, and from time totime fetched a sigh that he seemed to pluck up from the depths of hisbowels; but they all thought it must be from the pain he felt in his ribs;at any rate they who had seen him plastered the night before thought so.</p><p>As soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called tothe host and said in a very grave and measured voice, &ldquo;Many and great arethe favours, Señor Alcaide, that I have received in this castle of yours,and I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you for themall the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging you of anyarrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling is no otherthan to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and to chastiseperfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of this kind youneed only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of knighthoodwhich I have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation to theutmost of your desire.&rdquo;</p><p>The innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness, &ldquo;Sir Knight, I do notwant your worship to avenge me of any wrong, because when any is done me Ican take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing I want is thatyou pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night, as wellfor the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for supper and beds.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c16c" id="c16c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c16c.jpg (326K)" src="images/c16c.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c16c.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Then this is an inn?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;And a very respectable one,&rdquo; said the innkeeper.</p><p>&ldquo;I have been under a mistake all this time,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;for intruth I thought it was a castle, and not a bad one; but since it appearsthat it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now is that youshould excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule ofknights-errant, of whom I know as a fact (and up to the present I haveread nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging or anythingelse in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality that might beoffered them is their due by law and right in return for the insufferabletoil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by day, in summer andin winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and thirst, cold and heat,exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and all the hardships of earth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have little to do with that,&rdquo; replied the innkeeper; &ldquo;pay me what youowe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all I care about isto get my money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, and putting spursto Rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out of the innbefore anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distance without lookingto see if his squire was following him.</p><p>The innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get payment ofSancho, who said that as his master would not pay neither would he,because, being as he was squire to a knight-errant, the same rule andreason held good for him as for his master with regard to not payinganything in inns and hostelries. At this the innkeeper waxed very wroth,and threatened if he did not pay to compel him in a way that he would notlike. To which Sancho made answer that by the law of chivalry his masterhad received he would not pay a rap, though it cost him his life; for theexcellent and ancient usage of knights-errant was not going to be violatedby him, nor should the squires of such as were yet to come into the worldever complain of him or reproach him with breaking so just a privilege.</p><p>The ill-luck of the unfortunate Sancho so ordered it that among thecompany in the inn there were four woolcarders from Segovia, threeneedle-makers from the Colt of Cordova, and two lodgers from the Fair ofSeville, lively fellows, tender-hearted, fond of a joke, and playful, who,almost as if instigated and moved by a common impulse, made up to Sanchoand dismounted him from his ass, while one of them went in for the blanketof the host&rsquo;s bed; but on flinging him into it they looked up, and seeingthat the ceiling was somewhat lower than what they required for their work,they decided upon going out into the yard, which was bounded by the sky,and there, putting Sancho in the middle of the blanket, they began toraise him high, making sport with him as they would with a dog atShrovetide.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c16d" id="c16d"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c16d.jpg (285K)" src="images/c16d.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c16d.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached theears of his master, who, halting to listen attentively, was persuaded thatsome new adventure was coming, until he clearly perceived that it was hissquire who uttered them. Wheeling about he came up to the inn with alaborious gallop, and finding it shut went round it to see if he couldfind some way of getting in; but as soon as he came to the wall of theyard, which was not very high, he discovered the game that was beingplayed with his squire. He saw him rising and falling in the air with suchgrace and nimbleness that, had his rage allowed him, it is my belief hewould have laughed. He tried to climb from his horse on to the top of thewall, but he was so bruised and battered that he could not even dismount;and so from the back of his horse he began to utter such maledictions andobjurgations against those who were blanketing Sancho as it would beimpossible to write down accurately: they, however, did not stay theirlaughter or their work for this, nor did the flying Sancho cease hislamentations, mingled now with threats, now with entreaties but all tolittle purpose, or none at all, until from pure weariness they left off.They then brought him his ass, and mounting him on top of it they put hisjacket round him; and the compassionate Maritornes, seeing him soexhausted, thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water, and that itmight be all the cooler she fetched it from the well. Sancho took it, andas he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of hismaster exclaiming, &ldquo;Sancho, my son, drink not water; drink it not, my son,for it will kill thee; see, here I have the blessed balsam (and he held upthe flask of liquor), and with drinking two drops of it thou wiltcertainly be restored.&rdquo;</p><p>At these words Sancho turned his eyes asquint, and in a still louder voicesaid, &ldquo;Can it be your worship has forgotten that I am not a knight, or doyou want me to end by vomiting up what bowels I have left after lastnight? Keep your liquor in the name of all the devils, and leave me tomyself!&rdquo; and at one and the same instant he left off talking and begandrinking; but as at the first sup he perceived it was water he did notcare to go on with it, and begged Maritornes to fetch him some wine, whichshe did with right good will, and paid for it with her own money; forindeed they say of her that, though she was in that line of life, therewas some faint and distant resemblance to a Christian about her. WhenSancho had done drinking he dug his heels into his ass, and the gate ofthe inn being thrown open he passed out very well pleased at having paidnothing and carried his point, though it had been at the expense of hisusual sureties, his shoulders. It is true that the innkeeper detained hisalforjas in payment of what was owing to him, but Sancho took hisdeparture in such a flurry that he never missed them. The innkeeper, assoon as he saw him off, wanted to bar the gate close, but the blanketerswould not agree to it, for they were fellows who would not have cared twofarthings for Don Quixote, even had he been really one of theknights-errant of the Round Table.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c17e" id="c17e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c17e.jpg (47K)" src="images/c17e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br/>IN WHICH IS RELATED THE DISCOURSE SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS MASTER, DONQUIXOTE, AND OTHER ADVENTURES WORTH RELATING</h3><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c18a" id="c18a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c18a.jpg (79K)" src="images/c18a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c18a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Sancho reached his master so limp and faint that he could not urge on hisbeast. When Don Quixote saw the state he was in he said, &ldquo;I have now cometo the conclusion, good Sancho, that this castle or inn is beyond a doubtenchanted, because those who have so atrociously diverted themselves withthee, what can they be but phantoms or beings of another world? and I holdthis confirmed by having noticed that when I was by the wall of the yardwitnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy, it was out of my power to mountupon it, nor could I even dismount from Rocinante, because they no doubthad me enchanted; for I swear to thee by the faith of what I am that if Ihad been able to climb up or dismount, I would have avenged thee in such away that those braggart thieves would have remembered their freak forever, even though in so doing I knew that I contravened the laws ofchivalry, which, as I have often told thee, do not permit a knight to layhands on him who is not one, save in case of urgent and great necessity indefence of his own life and person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would have avenged myself too if I could,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;whether I hadbeen dubbed knight or not, but I could not; though for my part I ampersuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms orenchanted men, as your worship says, but men of flesh and bone likeourselves; and they all had their names, for I heard them name them whenthey were tossing me, and one was called Pedro Martinez, and anotherTenorio Hernandez, and the innkeeper, I heard, was called Juan Palomequethe Left-handed; so that, señor, your not being able to leap over the wallof the yard or dismount from your horse came of something else besidesenchantments; and what I make out clearly from all this is, that theseadventures we go seeking will in the end lead us into such misadventuresthat we shall not know which is our right foot; and that the best andwisest thing, according to my small wits, would be for us to return home,now that it is harvest-time, and attend to our business, and give overwandering from Zeca to Mecca and from pail to bucket, as the saying is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How little thou knowest about chivalry, Sancho,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote;&ldquo;hold thy peace and have patience; the day will come when thou shalt seewith thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in thepursuit of this calling; nay, tell me, what greater pleasure can there bein the world, or what delight can equal that of winning a battle, andtriumphing over one&rsquo;s enemy? None, beyond all doubt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;though I do not know it; all I know isthat since we have been knights-errant, or since your worship has been one(for I have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable a number) wehave never won any battle except the one with the Biscayan, and even outof that your worship came with half an ear and half a helmet the less; andfrom that till now it has been all cudgellings and more cudgellings, cuffsand more cuffs, I getting the blanketing over and above, and falling inwith enchanted persons on whom I cannot avenge myself so as to know whatthe delight, as your worship calls it, of conquering an enemy is like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is what vexes me, and what ought to vex thee, Sancho,&rdquo; replied DonQuixote; &ldquo;but henceforward I will endeavour to have at hand some swordmade by such craft that no kind of enchantments can take effect upon himwho carries it, and it is even possible that fortune may procure for methat which belonged to Amadis when he was called &lsquo;The Knight of theBurning Sword,&rsquo; which was one of the best swords that ever knight in theworld possessed, for, besides having the said virtue, it cut like a razor,and there was no armour, however strong and enchanted it might be, thatcould resist it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Such is my luck,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that even if that happened and yourworship found some such sword, it would, like the balsam, turn outserviceable and good for dubbed knights only, and as for the squires, theymight sup sorrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fear not that, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote: &ldquo;Heaven will deal better bythee.&rdquo;</p><p>Thus talking, Don Quixote and his squire were going along, when, on theroad they were following, Don Quixote perceived approaching them a largeand thick cloud of dust, on seeing which he turned to Sancho and said:</p><p>&ldquo;This is the day, Sancho, on which will be seen the boon my fortune isreserving for me; this, I say, is the day on which as much as on any othershall be displayed the might of my arm, and on which I shall do deeds thatshall remain written in the book of fame for all ages to come. Seest thouthat cloud of dust which rises yonder? Well, then, all that is churned upby a vast army composed of various and countless nations that comesmarching there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;According to that there must be two,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for on this oppositeside also there rises just such another cloud of dust.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote turned to look and found that it was true, and rejoicingexceedingly, he concluded that they were two armies about to engage andencounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at all times and seasonshis fancy was full of the battles, enchantments, adventures, crazy feats,loves, and defiances that are recorded in the books of chivalry, andeverything he said, thought, or did had reference to such things. Now thecloud of dust he had seen was raised by two great droves of sheep comingalong the same road in opposite directions, which, because of the dust,did not become visible until they drew near, but Don Quixote asserted sopositively that they were armies that Sancho was led to believe it andsay, &ldquo;Well, and what are we to do, señor?&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c17b" id="c17b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c17b.jpg (339K)" src="images/c17b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c17b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Don Quixote: &ldquo;give aid and assistance to the weak and thosewho need it; and thou must know, Sancho, that this which comes opposite tous is conducted and led by the mighty emperor Alifanfaron, lord of thegreat isle of Trapobana; this other that marches behind me is that of hisenemy the king of the Garamantas, Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, for healways goes into battle with his right arm bare.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But why are these two lords such enemies?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are at enmity,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;because this Alifanfaron is afurious pagan and is in love with the daughter of Pentapolin, who is avery beautiful and moreover gracious lady, and a Christian, and her fatheris unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first abandonsthe religion of his false prophet Mahomet, and adopts his own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By my beard,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but Pentapolin does quite right, and I willhelp him as much as I can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that thou wilt do what is thy duty, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;for toengage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbed knight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I can well understand,&rdquo; answered Sancho; &ldquo;but where shall we putthis ass where we may be sure to find him after the fray is over? for Ibelieve it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast ofthis kind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and what you had best do with him is toleave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not, for the horses weshall have when we come out victors will be so many that even Rocinantewill run a risk of being changed for another. But attend to me andobserve, for I wish to give thee some account of the chief knights whoaccompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the better see and mark,let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder, whence both armies maybe seen.&rdquo;</p><p>They did so, and placed themselves on a rising ground from which the twodroves that Don Quixote made armies of might have been plainly seen if theclouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded the sight;nevertheless, seeing in his imagination what he did not see and what didnot exist, he began thus in a loud voice:</p><p>&ldquo;That knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears upon hisshield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is the valiantLaurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in armour with flowers of gold,who bears on his shield three crowns argent on an azure field, is the dreadedMicocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; that other of gigantic frame, on his righthand, is the ever dauntless Brandabarbaran de Boliche, lord of the threeArabias, who for armour wears that serpent skin, and has for shield a gatewhich, according to tradition, is one of those of the temple that Samsonbrought to the ground when by his death he revenged himself upon his enemies.But turn thine eyes to the other side, and thou shalt see in front and in thevan of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquished Timonel ofCarcajona, prince of New Biscay, who comes in armour with arms quartered azure,vert, white, and yellow, and bears on his shield a cat or on a field tawny witha motto which says <i>Miau</i>, which is the beginning of the name of his lady,who according to report is the peerless Miaulina, daughter of the dukeAlfeniquen of the Algarve; the other, who burdens and presses the loins of thatpowerful charger and bears arms white as snow and a shield blank and withoutany device, is a novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by name,lord of the baronies of Utrique; that other, who with iron-shod heels strikesthe flanks of that nimble parti-coloured zebra, and for arms bears azure vair,is the mighty duke of Nerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque, who bears for deviceon his shield an asparagus plant with a motto in Castilian that says,<i>&lsquo;Rastrea mi suerte&rsquo;</i>.&rdquo; And so he went on naming anumber of knights of one squadron or the other out of his imagination, and toall he assigned off-hand their arms, colours, devices, and mottoes, carriedaway by the illusions of his unheard-of craze; and without a pause, hecontinued, &ldquo;People of divers nations compose this squadron in front; hereare those that drink of the sweet waters of the famous Xanthus, those thatscour the woody Massilian plains, those that sift the pure fine gold of ArabiaFelix, those that enjoy the famed cool banks of the crystal Thermodon, thosethat in many and various ways divert the streams of the golden Pactolus, theNumidians, faithless in their promises, the Persians renowned in archery, theParthians and the Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that ever shift theirdwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, the Ethiopians with piercedlips, and an infinity of other nations whose features I recognise and descry,though I cannot recall their names. In this other squadron there come thosethat drink of the crystal streams of the olive-bearing Betis, those that makesmooth their countenances with the water of the ever rich and golden Tagus,those that rejoice in the fertilising flow of the divine Genil, those that roamthe Tartesian plains abounding in pasture, those that take their pleasure inthe Elysian meadows of Jerez, the rich Manchegans crowned with ruddy ears ofcorn, the wearers of iron, old relics of the Gothic race, those that bathe inthe Pisuerga renowned for its gentle current, those that feed their herds alongthe spreading pastures of the winding Guadiana famed for its hidden course,those that tremble with the cold of the pineclad Pyrenees or the dazzling snowsof the lofty Apennine; in a word, as many as all Europe includes andcontains.&rdquo;</p><p>Good God! what a number of countries and nations he named! giving to eachits proper attributes with marvellous readiness; brimful and saturatedwith what he had read in his lying books! Sancho Panza hung upon his wordswithout speaking, and from time to time turned to try if he could see theknights and giants his master was describing, and as he could not make outone of them he said to him:</p><p>&ldquo;Señor, devil take it if there&rsquo;s a sign of any man you talk of, knight orgiant, in the whole thing; maybe it&rsquo;s all enchantment, like the phantomslast night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How canst thou say that!&rdquo; answered Don Quixote; &ldquo;dost thou not hear theneighing of the steeds, the braying of the trumpets, the roll of thedrums?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hear nothing but a great bleating of ewes and sheep,&rdquo; said Sancho;which was true, for by this time the two flocks had come close.</p><p>&ldquo;The fear thou art in, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;prevents thee fromseeing or hearing correctly, for one of the effects of fear is to derangethe senses and make things appear different from what they are; if thouart in such fear, withdraw to one side and leave me to myself, for alone Isuffice to bring victory to that side to which I shall give my aid;&rdquo; andso saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and putting the lance in rest, shotdown the slope like a thunderbolt. Sancho shouted after him, crying, &ldquo;Comeback, Señor Don Quixote; I vow to God they are sheep and ewes you arecharging! Come back! Unlucky the father that begot me! what madness isthis! Look, there is no giant, nor knight, nor cats, nor arms, nor shieldsquartered or whole, nor vair azure or bedevilled. What are you about?Sinner that I am before God!&rdquo; But not for all these entreaties did DonQuixote turn back; on the contrary he went on shouting out, &ldquo;Ho, knights,ye who follow and fight under the banners of the valiant emperorPentapolin of the Bare Arm, follow me all; ye shall see how easily I shallgive him his revenge over his enemy Alifanfaron of the Trapobana.&rdquo;</p><p>So saying, he dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes, and beganspearing them with as much spirit and intrepidity as if he weretransfixing mortal enemies in earnest. The shepherds and droversaccompanying the flock shouted to him to desist; seeing it was no use,they ungirt their slings and began to salute his ears with stones as bigas one&rsquo;s fist. Don Quixote gave no heed to the stones, but, letting driveright and left kept saying:</p><p>&ldquo;Where art thou, proud Alifanfaron? Come before me; I am a single knightwho would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand, and make thee yield thylife a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiant PentapolinGaramanta.&rdquo; Here came a sugar-plum from the brook that struck him on theside and buried a couple of ribs in his body. Feeling himself so smitten,he imagined himself slain or badly wounded for certain, and recollectinghis liquor he drew out his flask, and putting it to his mouth began topour the contents into his stomach; but ere he had succeeded in swallowingwhat seemed to him enough, there came another almond which struck him onthe hand and on the flask so fairly that it smashed it to pieces, knockingthree or four teeth and grinders out of his mouth in its course, andsorely crushing two fingers of his hand. Such was the force of the firstblow and of the second, that the poor knight in spite of himself came downbackwards off his horse. The shepherds came up, and felt sure they hadkilled him; so in all haste they collected their flock together, took upthe dead beasts, of which there were more than seven, and made off withoutwaiting to ascertain anything further.</p><p>All this time Sancho stood on the hill watching the crazy feats his masterwas performing, and tearing his beard and cursing the hour and theoccasion when fortune had made him acquainted with him. Seeing him, then,brought to the ground, and that the shepherds had taken themselves off, heran to him and found him in very bad case, though not unconscious; andsaid he:</p><p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you to come back, Señor Don Quixote; and that what youwere going to attack were not armies but droves of sheep?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how that thief of a sage, my enemy, can alter and falsify things,&rdquo;answered Don Quixote; &ldquo;thou must know, Sancho, that it is a very easymatter for those of his sort to make us believe what they choose; and thismalignant being who persecutes me, envious of the glory he knew I was towin in this battle, has turned the squadrons of the enemy into droves ofsheep. At any rate, do this much, I beg of thee, Sancho, to undeceivethyself, and see that what I say is true; mount thy ass and follow themquietly, and thou shalt see that when they have gone some little distancefrom this they will return to their original shape and, ceasing to besheep, become men in all respects as I described them to thee at first.But go not just yet, for I want thy help and assistance; come hither, andsee how many of my teeth and grinders are missing, for I feel as if therewas not one left in my mouth.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his mouth; now justat that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of Don Quixote, so, atthe very instant when Sancho came to examine his mouth, he discharged allits contents with more force than a musket, and full into the beard of thecompassionate squire.</p><p>&ldquo;Holy Mary!&rdquo; cried Sancho, &ldquo;what is this that has happened me? Clearlythis sinner is mortally wounded, as he vomits blood from the mouth;&rdquo; butconsidering the matter a little more closely he perceived by the colour,taste, and smell, that it was not blood but the balsam from the flaskwhich he had seen him drink; and he was taken with such a loathing thathis stomach turned, and he vomited up his inside over his very master, andboth were left in a precious state. Sancho ran to his ass to get somethingwherewith to clean himself, and relieve his master, out of his alforjas;but not finding them, he well-nigh took leave of his senses, and cursedhimself anew, and in his heart resolved to quit his master and returnhome, even though he forfeited the wages of his service and all hopes ofthe promised island.</p><p>Don Quixote now rose, and putting his left hand to his mouth to keep histeeth from falling out altogether, with the other he laid hold of thebridle of Rocinante, who had never stirred from his master&rsquo;s side&mdash;soloyal and well-behaved was he&mdash;and betook himself to where the squirestood leaning over his ass with his hand to his cheek, like one in deepdejection. Seeing him in this mood, looking so sad, Don Quixote said tohim:</p><p>&ldquo;Bear in mind, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless hedoes more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signsthat fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well with us,for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and hence itfollows that the evil having lasted long, the good must be now nigh athand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes which happen tome, since thou hast no share in them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How have I not?&rdquo; replied Sancho; &ldquo;was he whom they blanketed yesterdayperchance any other than my father&rsquo;s son? and the alforjas that aremissing to-day with all my treasures, did they belong to any other butmyself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! are the alforjas missing, Sancho?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, they are missing,&rdquo; answered Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;In that case we have nothing to eat to-day,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;It would be so,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;if there were none of the herbs yourworship says you know in these meadows, those with which knights-errant asunlucky as your worship are wont to supply such-like shortcomings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;I would rather have just now aquarter of bread, or a loaf and a couple of pilchards&rsquo; heads, than all theherbs described by Dioscorides, even with Doctor Laguna&rsquo;s notes.Nevertheless, Sancho the Good, mount thy beast and come along with me, forGod, who provides for all things, will not fail us (more especially whenwe are so active in his service as we are), since he fails not the midgesof the air, nor the grubs of the earth, nor the tadpoles of the water, andis so merciful that he maketh his sun to rise on the good and on the evil,and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your worship would make a better preacher than knight-errant,&rdquo; saidSancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Knights-errant knew and ought to know everything, Sancho,&rdquo; said DonQuixote; &ldquo;for there were knights-errant in former times as well qualifiedto deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of an encampment, as ifthey had graduated in the University of Paris; whereby we may see that thelance has never blunted the pen, nor the pen the lance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, be it as your worship says,&rdquo; replied Sancho; &ldquo;let us be off now andfind some place of shelter for the night, and God grant it may besomewhere where there are no blankets, nor blanketeers, nor phantoms, norenchanted Moors; for if there are, may the devil take the whole concern.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ask that of God, my son,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; and do thou lead on wherethou wilt, for this time I leave our lodging to thy choice; but reach mehere thy hand, and feel with thy finger, and find out how many of my teethand grinders are missing from this right side of the upper jaw, for it isthere I feel the pain.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho put in his fingers, and feeling about asked him, &ldquo;How many grindersused your worship have on this side?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Four,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;besides the back-tooth, all whole and quitesound.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mind what you are saying, señor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I say four, if not five,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;for never in my lifehave I had tooth or grinder drawn, nor has any fallen out or beendestroyed by any decay or rheum.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;in this lower side your worship has no morethan two grinders and a half, and in the upper neither a half nor any atall, for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Luckless that I am!&rdquo; said Don Quixote, hearing the sad news his squiregave him; &ldquo;I had rather they despoiled me of an arm, so it were not thesword-arm; for I tell thee, Sancho, a mouth without teeth is like a millwithout a millstone, and a tooth is much more to be prized than a diamond;but we who profess the austere order of chivalry are liable to all this.Mount, friend, and lead the way, and I will follow thee at whatever pacethou wilt.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho did as he bade him, and proceeded in the direction in which hethought he might find refuge without quitting the high road, which wasthere very much frequented. As they went along, then, at a slow pace&mdash;forthe pain in Don Quixote&rsquo;s jaws kept him uneasy and ill-disposed for speed&mdash;Sanchothought it well to amuse and divert him by talk of some kind, and amongthe things he said to him was that which will be told in the followingchapter.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c18e" id="c18e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c18e.jpg (44K)" src="images/c18e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br/>OF THE SHREWD DISCOURSE WHICH SANCHO HELD WITH HIS MASTER, AND OF THEADVENTURE THAT BEFELL HIM WITH A DEAD BODY, TOGETHER WITH OTHER NOTABLEOCCURRENCES</h3><p>&ldquo;It seems to me, señor, that all these mishaps that have befallen us oflate have been without any doubt a punishment for the offence committed byyour worship against the order of chivalry in not keeping the oath youmade not to eat bread off a tablecloth or embrace the queen, and all therest of it that your worship swore to observe until you had taken thathelmet of Malandrino&rsquo;s, or whatever the Moor is called, for I do not verywell remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art very right, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;but to tell the truth,it had escaped my memory; and likewise thou mayest rely upon it that theaffair of the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault in notreminding me of it in time; but I will make amends, for there are ways ofcompounding for everything in the order of chivalry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why! have I taken an oath of some sort, then?&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;It makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath,&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;suffice it that I see thou art not quite clear of complicity; and whetheror no, it will not be ill done to provide ourselves with a remedy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;mind that your worship does not forget thisas you did the oath; perhaps the phantoms may take it into their heads toamuse themselves once more with me; or even with your worship if they seeyou so obstinate.&rdquo;</p><p>While engaged in this and other talk, night overtook them on the roadbefore they had reached or discovered any place of shelter; and what madeit still worse was that they were dying of hunger, for with the loss ofthe alforjas they had lost their entire larder and commissariat; and tocomplete the misfortune they met with an adventure which without anyinvention had really the appearance of one. It so happened that the nightclosed in somewhat darkly, but for all that they pushed on, Sancho feelingsure that as the road was the king&rsquo;s highway they might reasonably expectto find some inn within a league or two. Going along, then, in this way,the night dark, the squire hungry, the master sharp-set, they saw comingtowards them on the road they were travelling a great number of lightswhich looked exactly like stars in motion. Sancho was taken aback at thesight of them, nor did Don Quixote altogether relish them: the one pulledup his ass by the halter, the other his hack by the bridle, and they stoodstill, watching anxiously to see what all this would turn out to be, andfound that the lights were approaching them, and the nearer they came thegreater they seemed, at which spectacle Sancho began to shake like a mandosed with mercury, and Don Quixote&rsquo;s hair stood on end; he, however,plucking up spirit a little, said:</p><p>&ldquo;This, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous adventure, inwhich it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour andresolution.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Unlucky me!&rdquo; answered Sancho; &ldquo;if this adventure happens to be one ofphantoms, as I am beginning to think it is, where shall I find the ribs tobear it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be they phantoms ever so much,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;I will not permit themto touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks with thee thetime before, it was because I was unable to leap the walls of the yard;but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able to wield my sword asI please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time,&rdquo; saidSancho, &ldquo;what difference will it make being on the open plain or not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;I entreat thee, Sancho, to keep agood heart, for experience will tell thee what mine is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will, please God,&rdquo; answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one side ofthe road set themselves to observe closely what all these moving lightsmight be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twenty encamisados,all on horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, the awe-inspiringaspect of whom completely extinguished the courage of Sancho, who began tochatter with his teeth like one in the cold fit of an ague; and his heartsank and his teeth chattered still more when they perceived distinctlythat behind them there came a litter covered over with black and followedby six more mounted figures in mourning down to the very feet of theirmules&mdash;for they could perceive plainly they were not horses by theeasy pace at which they went. And as the encamisados came along theymuttered to themselves in a low plaintive tone. This strange spectacle atsuch an hour and in such a solitary place was quite enough to striketerror into Sancho&rsquo;s heart, and even into his master&rsquo;s; and (save in DonQuixote&rsquo;s case) did so, for all Sancho&rsquo;s resolution had now broken down.It was just the opposite with his master, whose imagination immediatelyconjured up all this to him vividly as one of the adventures of his books.</p><p>He took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was bornesome sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reservedfor him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance inrest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit andbearing took up his position in the middle of the road where theencamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near athand he raised his voice and said:</p><p>&ldquo;Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who yeare, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye carry upon that bier, for,to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or some wrong hasbeen done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that I should know,either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done, or else that Imay avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted upon you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We are in haste,&rdquo; answered one of the encamisados, &ldquo;and the inn is faroff, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;&rdquo; andspurring his mule he moved on.</p><p>Don Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the mule bythe bridle he said, &ldquo;Halt, and be more mannerly, and render an account ofwhat I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat, all of you.&rdquo;</p><p>The mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized thatrearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches. Anattendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse DonQuixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his lance inrest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badly wounded tothe ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others the agility with whichhe attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for it seemed just as ifwings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, so lightly and proudly did hebear himself. The encamisados were all timid folk and unarmed, so theyspeedily made their escape from the fray and set off at a run across theplain with their lighted torches, looking exactly like maskers running onsome gala or festival night. The mourners, too, enveloped and swathed intheir skirts and gowns, were unable to bestir themselves, and so withentire safety to himself Don Quixote belaboured them all and drove themoff against their will, for they all thought it was no man but a devilfrom hell come to carry away the dead body they had in the litter.</p><p>Sancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord, andsaid to himself, &ldquo;Clearly this master of mine is as bold and valiant as hesays he is.&rdquo;</p><p>A burning torch lay on the ground near the first man whom the mule hadthrown, by the light of which Don Quixote perceived him, and coming up tohim he presented the point of the lance to his face, calling on him toyield himself prisoner, or else he would kill him; to which the prostrateman replied, &ldquo;I am prisoner enough as it is; I cannot stir, for one of mylegs is broken: I entreat you, if you be a Christian gentleman, not tokill me, which will be committing grave sacrilege, for I am a licentiateand I hold first orders.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then what the devil brought you here, being a churchman?&rdquo; said DonQuixote.</p><p>&ldquo;What, señor?&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;My bad luck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then still worse awaits you,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;if you do not satisfy meas to all I asked you at first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You shall be soon satisfied,&rdquo; said the licentiate; &ldquo;you must know, then,that though just now I said I was a licentiate, I am only a bachelor, andmy name is Alonzo Lopez; I am a native of Alcobendas, I come from the cityof Baeza with eleven others, priests, the same who fled with the torches,and we are going to the city of Segovia accompanying a dead body which isin that litter, and is that of a gentleman who died in Baeza, where he wasinterred; and now, as I said, we are taking his bones to theirburial-place, which is in Segovia, where he was born.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And who killed him?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;God, by means of a malignant fever that took him,&rdquo; answered the bachelor.</p><p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;the Lord has relieved me of the task ofavenging his death had any other slain him; but, he who slew him havingslain him, there is nothing for it but to be silent, and shrug one&rsquo;sshoulders; I should do the same were he to slay myself; and I would haveyour reverence know that I am a knight of La Mancha, Don Quixote by name,and it is my business and calling to roam the world righting wrongs andredressing injuries.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not know how that about righting wrongs can be,&rdquo; said the bachelor,&ldquo;for from straight you have made me crooked, leaving me with a broken legthat will never see itself straight again all the days of its life; andthe injury you have redressed in my case has been to leave me injured insuch a way that I shall remain injured for ever; and the height ofmisadventure it was to fall in with you who go in search of adventures.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Things do not all happen in the same way,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote; &ldquo;it allcame, Sir Bachelor Alonzo Lopez, of your going, as you did, by night,dressed in those surplices, with lighted torches, praying, covered withmourning, so that naturally you looked like something evil and of theother world; and so I could not avoid doing my duty in attacking you, andI should have attacked you even had I known positively that you were thevery devils of hell, for such I certainly believed and took you to be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As my fate has so willed it,&rdquo; said the bachelor, &ldquo;I entreat you, sirknight-errant, whose errand has been such an evil one for me, to help meto get from under this mule that holds one of my legs caught between thestirrup and the saddle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would have talked on till to-morrow,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;how long wereyou going to wait before telling me of your distress?&rdquo;</p><p>He at once called to Sancho, who, however, had no mind to come, as he wasjust then engaged in unloading a sumpter mule, well laden with provender,which these worthy gentlemen had brought with them. Sancho made a bag ofhis coat, and, getting together as much as he could, and as the bag wouldhold, he loaded his beast, and then hastened to obey his master&rsquo;s call,and helped him to remove the bachelor from under the mule; then puttinghim on her back he gave him the torch, and Don Quixote bade him follow thetrack of his companions, and beg pardon of them on his part for the wrongwhich he could not help doing them.</p><p>And said Sancho, &ldquo;If by chance these gentlemen should want to know who wasthe hero that served them so, your worship may tell them that he is thefamous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of the RuefulCountenance.&rdquo;</p><p>The bachelor then took his departure.</p><p>I forgot to mention that before he did so he said to Don Quixote,&ldquo;Remember that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent hands on aholy thing, <i>juxta illud, si quis, suadente diabolo</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not understand that Latin,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;but I know well Idid not lay hands, only this pike; besides, I did not think I wascommitting an assault upon priests or things of the Church, which, like aCatholic and faithful Christian as I am, I respect and revere, but uponphantoms and spectres of the other world; but even so, I remember how itfared with Cid Ruy Diaz when he broke the chair of the ambassador of thatking before his Holiness the Pope, who excommunicated him for the same;and yet the good Roderick of Vivar bore himself that day like a very nobleand valiant knight.&rdquo;</p><p>On hearing this the bachelor took his departure, as has been said, withoutmaking any reply; and Don Quixote asked Sancho what had induced him tocall him the &ldquo;Knight of the Rueful Countenance&rdquo; more then than at anyother time.</p><p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; answered Sancho; &ldquo;it was because I have been looking atyou for some time by the light of the torch held by that unfortunate, andverily your worship has got of late the most ill-favoured countenance Iever saw: it must be either owing to the fatigue of this combat, or elseto the want of teeth and grinders.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is not that,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;but because the sage whose duty itwill be to write the history of my achievements must have thought itproper that I should take some distinctive name as all knights of yoredid; one being &lsquo;He of the Burning Sword,&rsquo; another &lsquo;He of the Unicorn,&rsquo;this one &lsquo;He of the Damsels,&rsquo; that &lsquo;He of the Phœnix,&rsquo; another &lsquo;TheKnight of the Griffin,&rsquo; and another &lsquo;He of the Death,&rsquo; and by these namesand designations they were known all the world round; and so I say thatthe sage aforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mind just now tocall me &lsquo;The Knight of the Rueful Countenance,&rsquo; as I intend to call myselffrom this day forward; and that the said name may fit me better, I mean,when the opportunity offers, to have a very rueful countenance painted onmy shield.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no occasion, señor, for wasting time or money on making thatcountenance,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;for all that need be done is for your worshipto show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, and withoutanything more, either image or shield, they will call you &lsquo;Him of theRueful Countenance&rsquo; and believe me I am telling you the truth, for Iassure you, señor (and in good part be it said), hunger and the loss ofyour grinders have given you such an ill-favoured face that, as I say, therueful picture may be very well spared.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote laughed at Sancho&rsquo;s pleasantry; nevertheless he resolved tocall himself by that name, and have his shield or buckler painted as hehad devised.</p><p>Don Quixote would have looked to see whether the body in the litter werebones or not, but Sancho would not have it, saying:</p><p>&ldquo;Señor, you have ended this perilous adventure more safely for yourselfthan any of those I have seen: perhaps these people, though beaten androuted, may bethink themselves that it is a single man that has beatenthem, and feeling sore and ashamed of it may take heart and come in searchof us and give us trouble enough. The ass is in proper trim, the mountainsare near at hand, hunger presses, we have nothing more to do but make goodour retreat, and, as the saying is, the dead to the grave and the livingto the loaf.&rdquo;</p><p>And driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who,feeling that Sancho was right, did so without replying; and afterproceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves ina wide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloaded hisbeast, and stretched upon the green grass, with hunger for sauce, theybreakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfying theirappetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead man&rsquo;sclerical gentlemen (who seldom put themselves on short allowance) hadbrought with them on their sumpter mule. But another piece of ill-luckbefell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that was that theyhad no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips; and as thirsttormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow where they were was fullof green and tender grass, said what will be told in the followingchapter.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br/>OF THE UNEXAMPLED AND UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURE WHICH WAS ACHIEVED BY THEVALIANT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WITH LESS PERIL THAN ANY EVER ACHIEVED BYANY FAMOUS KNIGHT IN THE WORLD</h3><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c19a" id="c19a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c19a.jpg (147K)" src="images/c19a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c19a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;It cannot be, señor, but that this grass is a proof that there must behard by some spring or brook to give it moisture, so it would be well tomove a little farther on, that we may find some place where we may quenchthis terrible thirst that plagues us, which beyond a doubt is moredistressing than hunger.&rdquo;</p><p>The advice seemed good to Don Quixote, and, he leading Rocinante by thebridle and Sancho the ass by the halter, after he had packed away upon himthe remains of the supper, they advanced the meadow feeling their way, forthe darkness of the night made it impossible to see anything; but they hadnot gone two hundred paces when a loud noise of water, as if falling fromgreat rocks, struck their ears. The sound cheered them greatly; buthalting to make out by listening from what quarter it came they heardunseasonably another noise which spoiled the satisfaction the sound of thewater gave them, especially for Sancho, who was by nature timid andfaint-hearted. They heard, I say, strokes falling with a measured beat,and a certain rattling of iron and chains that, together with the furiousdin of the water, would have struck terror into any heart but DonQuixote&rsquo;s. The night was, as has been said, dark, and they had happened toreach a spot in among some tall trees, whose leaves stirred by a gentlebreeze made a low ominous sound; so that, what with the solitude, theplace, the darkness, the noise of the water, and the rustling of theleaves, everything inspired awe and dread; more especially as theyperceived that the strokes did not cease, nor the wind lull, nor morningapproach; to all which might be added their ignorance as to where theywere.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c19b" id="c19b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c19b.jpg (204K)" src="images/c19b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c19b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>But Don Quixote, supported by his intrepid heart, leaped on Rocinante, andbracing his buckler on his arm, brought his pike to the slope, and said,&ldquo;Friend Sancho, know that I by Heaven&rsquo;s will have been born in this ouriron age to revive in it the age of gold, or the golden as it iscalled; I am he for whom perils, mighty achievements, and valiant deedsare reserved; I am, I say again, he who is to revive the Knights of theRound Table, the Twelve of France and the Nine Worthies; and he who is toconsign to oblivion the Platirs, the Tablantes, the Olivantes andTirantes, the Phœbuses and Belianises, with the whole herd of famousknights-errant of days gone by, performing in these in which I live suchexploits, marvels, and feats of arms as shall obscure their brightestdeeds. Thou dost mark well, faithful and trusty squire, the gloom of thisnight, its strange silence, the dull confused murmur of those trees, theawful sound of that water in quest of which we came, that seems as thoughit were precipitating and dashing itself down from the lofty mountains ofthe Moon, and that incessant hammering that wounds and pains our ears;which things all together and each of itself are enough to instil fear,dread, and dismay into the breast of Mars himself, much more into one notused to hazards and adventures of the kind. Well, then, all this that Iput before thee is but an incentive and stimulant to my spirit, making myheart burst in my bosom through eagerness to engage in this adventure,arduous as it promises to be; therefore tighten Rocinante&rsquo;s girths alittle, and God be with thee; wait for me here three days and no more, andif in that time I come not back, thou canst return to our village, andthence, to do me a favour and a service, thou wilt go to El Toboso, wherethou shalt say to my incomparable lady Dulcinea that her captive knighthath died in attempting things that might make him worthy of being calledhers.&rdquo;</p><p>When Sancho heard his master&rsquo;s words he began to weep in the most patheticway, saying:</p><p>&ldquo;Señor, I know not why your worship wants to attempt this so dreadfuladventure; it is night now, no one sees us here, we can easily turn aboutand take ourselves out of danger, even if we don&rsquo;t drink for three days tocome; and as there is no one to see us, all the less will there be anyoneto set us down as cowards; besides, I have many a time heard the curate ofour village, whom your worship knows well, preach that he who seeks dangerperishes in it; so it is not right to tempt God by trying so tremendous afeat from which there can be no escape save by a miracle, and Heaven hasperformed enough of them for your worship in delivering you from beingblanketed as I was, and bringing you out victorious and safe and soundfrom among all those enemies that were with the dead man; and if all thisdoes not move or soften that hard heart, let this thought and reflectionmove it, that you will have hardly quitted this spot when from pure fear Ishall yield my soul up to anyone that will take it. I left home and wifeand children to come and serve your worship, trusting to do better and notworse; but as covetousness bursts the bag, it has rent my hopes asunder,for just as I had them highest about getting that wretched unlucky islandyour worship has so often promised me, I see that instead and in lieu ofit you mean to desert me now in a place so far from human reach: for God&rsquo;ssake, master mine, deal not so unjustly by me, and if your worship willnot entirely give up attempting this feat, at least put it off tillmorning, for by what the lore I learned when I was a shepherd tells me itcannot want three hours of dawn now, because the mouth of the Horn isoverhead and makes midnight in the line of the left arm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How canst thou see, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;where it makes that line,or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of, when thenight is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole heaven?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but fear has sharp eyes, and sees thingsunderground, much more above in heavens; besides, there is good reason toshow that it now wants but little of day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let it want what it may,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;it shall not be said ofme now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside from doingwhat was in accordance with knightly usage; and so I beg of thee, Sancho,to hold thy peace, for God, who has put it into my heart to undertake nowthis so unexampled and terrible adventure, will take care to watch over mysafety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to do is to tightenRocinante&rsquo;s girths well, and wait here, for I shall come back shortly,alive or dead.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho perceiving it his master&rsquo;s final resolve, and how little his tears,counsels, and entreaties prevailed with him, determined to have recourseto his own ingenuity and compel him, if he could, to wait till daylight;and so, while tightening the girths of the horse, he quietly and withoutbeing felt, with his ass&rsquo; halter tied both Rocinante&rsquo;s legs, so that whenDon Quixote strove to go he was unable as the horse could only move byjumps. Seeing the success of his trick, Sancho Panza said:</p><p>&ldquo;See there, señor! Heaven, moved by my tears and prayers, has so orderedit that Rocinante cannot stir; and if you will be obstinate, and spur andstrike him, you will only provoke fortune, and kick, as they say, againstthe pricks.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote at this grew desperate, but the more he drove his heels intothe horse, the less he stirred him; and not having any suspicion of thetying, he was fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak or untilRocinante could move, firmly persuaded that all this came of somethingother than Sancho&rsquo;s ingenuity. So he said to him, &ldquo;As it is so, Sancho,and as Rocinante cannot move, I am content to wait till dawn smiles uponus, even though I weep while it delays its coming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no need to weep,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;for I will amuse yourworship by telling stories from this till daylight, unless indeed you liketo dismount and lie down to sleep a little on the green grass after thefashion of knights-errant, so as to be fresher when day comes and themoment arrives for attempting this extraordinary adventure you are lookingforward to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What art thou talking about dismounting or sleeping for?&rdquo; said DonQuixote. &ldquo;Am I, thinkest thou, one of those knights that take their restin the presence of danger? Sleep thou who art born to sleep, or do as thouwilt, for I will act as I think most consistent with my character.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be not angry, master mine,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;I did not mean to say that;&rdquo;and coming close to him he laid one hand on the pommel of the saddle andthe other on the cantle so that he held his master&rsquo;s left thigh in hisembrace, not daring to separate a finger&rsquo;s width from him; so much afraidwas he of the strokes which still resounded with a regular beat. DonQuixote bade him tell some story to amuse him as he had proposed, to whichSancho replied that he would if his dread of what he heard would let him;&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will strive to tell a story which, if I can manage torelate it, and nobody interferes with the telling, is the best of stories,and let your worship give me your attention, for here I begin. What was,was; and may the good that is to come be for all, and the evil for him whogoes to look for it&mdash;your worship must know that the beginning theold folk used to put to their tales was not just as each one pleased; itwas a maxim of Cato Zonzorino the Roman, that says &lsquo;the evil for him thatgoes to look for it,&rsquo; and it comes as pat to the purpose now as ring tofinger, to show that your worship should keep quiet and not go looking forevil in any quarter, and that we should go back by some other road, sincenobody forces us to follow this in which so many terrors affright us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go on with thy story, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and leave the choice ofour road to my care.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I say then,&rdquo; continued Sancho, &ldquo;that in a village of Estremadura therewas a goat-shepherd&mdash;that is to say, one who tended goats&mdash;whichshepherd or goatherd, as my story goes, was called Lope Ruiz, and thisLope Ruiz was in love with a shepherdess called Torralva, whichshepherdess called Torralva was the daughter of a rich grazier, and thisrich grazier&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If that is the way thou tellest thy tale, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;repeating twice all thou hast to say, thou wilt not have done these twodays; go straight on with it, and tell it like a reasonable man, or elsesay nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tales are always told in my country in the very way I am telling this,&rdquo;answered Sancho, &ldquo;and I cannot tell it in any other, nor is it right ofyour worship to ask me to make new customs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell it as thou wilt,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;and as fate will have itthat I cannot help listening to thee, go on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And so, lord of my soul,&rdquo; continued Sancho, as I have said, this shepherdwas in love with Torralva the shepherdess, who was a wild buxom lass withsomething of the look of a man about her, for she had little moustaches; Ifancy I see her now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you knew her?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;I did not know her,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but he who told me the story said itwas so true and certain that when I told it to another I might safelydeclare and swear I had seen it all myself. And so in course of time, thedevil, who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion, contrived thatthe love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned into hatred andill-will, and the reason, according to evil tongues, was some littlejealousy she caused him that crossed the line and trespassed on forbiddenground; and so much did the shepherd hate her from that time forward that,in order to escape from her, he determined to quit the country and gowhere he should never set eyes on her again. Torralva, when she foundherself spurned by Lope, was immediately smitten with love for him, thoughshe had never loved him before.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the natural way of women,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;to scorn the onethat loves them, and love the one that hates them: go on, Sancho.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It came to pass,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that the shepherd carried out hisintention, and driving his goats before him took his way across the plainsof Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal. Torralva, whoknew of it, went after him, and on foot and barefoot followed him at adistance, with a pilgrim&rsquo;s staff in her hand and a scrip round her neck,in which she carried, it is said, a bit of looking-glass and a piece of acomb and some little pot or other of paint for her face; but let her carrywhat she did, I am not going to trouble myself to prove it; all I say is,that the shepherd, they say, came with his flock to cross over the riverGuadiana, which was at that time swollen and almost overflowing its banks,and at the spot he came to there was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone tocarry him or his flock to the other side, at which he was much vexed, forhe perceived that Torralva was approaching and would give him greatannoyance with her tears and entreaties; however, he went looking about soclosely that he discovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat sosmall that it could only hold one person and one goat; but for all that hespoke to him and agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundredgoats across. The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat over;he came back and carried another over; he came back again, and againbrought over another&mdash;let your worship keep count of the goats thefisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will be anend of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word of it. Toproceed, I must tell you the landing place on the other side was miry andslippery, and the fisherman lost a great deal of time in going and coming;still he returned for another goat, and another, and another.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take it for granted he brought them all across,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;anddon&rsquo;t keep going and coming in this way, or thou wilt not make an end ofbringing them over this twelvemonth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How many have gone across so far?&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;How the devil do I know?&rdquo; replied Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;what I told you, that you must keep a goodcount; well then, by God, there is an end of the story, for there is nogoing any farther.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;is it so essential to the story toknow to a nicety the goats that have crossed over, that if there be amistake of one in the reckoning, thou canst not go on with it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, señor, not a bit,&rdquo; replied Sancho; &ldquo;for when I asked your worship totell me how many goats had crossed, and you answered you did not know, atthat very instant all I had to say passed away out of my memory, and,faith, there was much virtue in it, and entertainment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, then,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;the story has come to an end?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As much as my mother has,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;thou hast told one of the rarest stories,tales, or histories, that anyone in the world could have imagined, andsuch a way of telling it and ending it was never seen nor will be in alifetime; though I expected nothing else from thy excellent understanding.But I do not wonder, for perhaps those ceaseless strokes may have confusedthy wits.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that may be,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;but I know that as to my story, allthat can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the count ofthe passage of the goats begins.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let it end where it will, well and good,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and let ussee if Rocinante can go;&rdquo; and again he spurred him, and again Rocinantemade jumps and remained where he was, so well tied was he.</p><p>Just then, whether it was the cold of the morning that was nowapproaching, or that he had eaten something laxative at supper, or that itwas only natural (as is most likely), Sancho felt a desire to do what noone could do for him; but so great was the fear that had penetrated hisheart, he dared not separate himself from his master by as much as theblack of his nail; to escape doing what he wanted was, however, alsoimpossible; so what he did for peace&rsquo;s sake was to remove his right hand,which held the back of the saddle, and with it to untie gently andsilently the running string which alone held up his breeches, so that onloosening it they at once fell down round his feet like fetters; he thenraised his shirt as well as he could and bared his hind quarters, no slimones. But, this accomplished, which he fancied was all he had to do to getout of this terrible strait and embarrassment, another still greaterdifficulty presented itself, for it seemed to him impossible to relievehimself without making some noise, and he ground his teeth and squeezedhis shoulders together, holding his breath as much as he could; but inspite of his precautions he was unlucky enough after all to make a littlenoise, very different from that which was causing him so much fear.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c19c" id="c19c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c19c.jpg (308K)" src="images/c19c.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c19c.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote, hearing it, said, &ldquo;What noise is that, Sancho?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, señor,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it must be something new, for adventuresand misadventures never begin with a trifle.&rdquo; Once more he tried his luck,and succeeded so well, that without any further noise or disturbance hefound himself relieved of the burden that had given him so muchdiscomfort. But as Don Quixote&rsquo;s sense of smell was as acute as hishearing, and as Sancho was so closely linked with him that the fumes rosealmost in a straight line, it could not be but that some should reach hisnose, and as soon as they did he came to its relief by compressing itbetween his fingers, saying in a rather snuffing tone, &ldquo;Sancho, it strikesme thou art in great fear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; answered Sancho; &ldquo;but how does your worship perceive it now morethan ever?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because just now thou smellest stronger than ever, and not of ambergris,&rdquo;answered Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s not my fault, but your worship&rsquo;s,for leading me about at unseasonable hours and at such unwonted paces.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then go back three or four, my friend,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, all the timewith his fingers to his nose; &ldquo;and for the future pay more attention tothy person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my great familiaritywith thee that has bred this contempt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;that your worship thinks I have donesomething I ought not with my person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It makes it worse to stir it, friend Sancho,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote.</p><p>With this and other talk of the same sort master and man passed the night,till Sancho, perceiving that daybreak was coming on apace, very cautiouslyuntied Rocinante and tied up his breeches. As soon as Rocinante foundhimself free, though by nature he was not at all mettlesome, he seemed tofeel lively and began pawing&mdash;for as to capering, begging his pardon,he knew not what it meant. Don Quixote, then, observing that Rocinantecould move, took it as a good sign and a signal that he should attempt thedread adventure. By this time day had fully broken and everything showeddistinctly, and Don Quixote saw that he was among some tall trees,chestnuts, which cast a very deep shade; he perceived likewise that thesound of the strokes did not cease, but could not discover what caused it,and so without any further delay he let Rocinante feel the spur, and oncemore taking leave of Sancho, he told him to wait for him there three daysat most, as he had said before, and if he should not have returned by thattime, he might feel sure it had been God&rsquo;s will that he should end hisdays in that perilous adventure. He again repeated the message andcommission with which he was to go on his behalf to his lady Dulcinea, andsaid he was not to be uneasy as to the payment of his services, for beforeleaving home he had made his will, in which he would find himself fullyrecompensed in the matter of wages in due proportion to the time he hadserved; but if God delivered him safe, sound, and unhurt out of thatdanger, he might look upon the promised island as much more than certain.Sancho began to weep afresh on again hearing the affecting words of hisgood master, and resolved to stay with him until the final issue and endof the business. From these tears and this honourable resolve of SanchoPanza&rsquo;s the author of this history infers that he must have been of goodbirth and at least an old Christian; and the feeling he displayed touchedhis but not so much as to make him show any weakness; on the contrary,hiding what he felt as well as he could, he began to move towards thatquarter whence the sound of the water and of the strokes seemed to come.</p><p>Sancho followed him on foot, leading by the halter, as his custom was, hisass, his constant comrade in prosperity or adversity; and advancing somedistance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a little meadowat the foot of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush of water flungitself. At the foot of the rocks were some rudely constructed houseslooking more like ruins than houses, from among which came, theyperceived, the din and clatter of blows, which still continued withoutintermission. Rocinante took fright at the noise of the water and of theblows, but quieting him Don Quixote advanced step by step towards thehouses, commending himself with all his heart to his lady, imploring hersupport in that dread pass and enterprise, and on the way commendinghimself to God, too, not to forget him. Sancho who never quitted his side,stretched his neck as far as he could and peered between the legs ofRocinante to see if he could now discover what it was that caused him suchfear and apprehension. They went it might be a hundred paces farther, whenon turning a corner the true cause, beyond the possibility of any mistake,of that dread-sounding and to them awe-inspiring noise that had kept themall the night in such fear and perplexity, appeared plain and obvious; andit was (if, reader, thou art not disgusted and disappointed) six fullinghammers which by their alternate strokes made all the din.</p><p>When Don Quixote perceived what it was, he was struck dumb and rigid fromhead to foot. Sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bent downupon his breast in manifest mortification; and Don Quixote glanced atSancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full oflaughter, and evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of hisvexation he could not help laughing at the sight of him; and when Sanchosaw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to hold his sideswith both hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter. Four times hestopped, and as many times did his laughter break out afresh with the sameviolence as at first, whereat Don Quixote grew furious, above all when heheard him say mockingly, &ldquo;Thou must know, friend Sancho, that of Heaven&rsquo;swill I was born in this our iron age to revive in it the golden or age ofgold; I am he for whom are reserved perils, mighty achievements, valiantdeeds;&rdquo; and here he went on repeating the words that Don Quixote utteredthe first time they heard the awful strokes.</p><p>Don Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule, wasso mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two suchblows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had caughtthem on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless indeed tohis heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward return in earnestfor his jest, and fearing his master might carry it still further, said tohim very humbly, &ldquo;Calm yourself, sir, for by God I am only joking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, if you are joking I am not,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote. &ldquo;Look here,my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers, had beensome perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown the courage requiredfor the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance, being, as I am, agentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and tell whether they comefrom fulling mills or not; and that, when perhaps, as is the case, I havenever in my life seen any as you have, low boor as you are, that have beenborn and bred among them? But turn me these six hammers into six giants,and bring them to beard me, one by one or all together, and if I do notknock them head over heels, then make what mockery you like of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No more of that, señor,&rdquo; returned Sancho; &ldquo;I own I went a little too farwith the joke. But tell me, your worship, now that peace is made betweenus (and may God bring you out of all the adventures that may befall you assafe and sound as he has brought you out of this one), was it not a thingto laugh at, and is it not a good story, the great fear we were in?&mdash;atleast that I was in; for as to your worship I see now that you neitherknow nor understand what either fear or dismay is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not deny,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that what happened to us may be worthlaughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it is noteveryone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;your worship knew how to hit the right pointwith your pike, aiming at my head and hitting me on the shoulders, thanksbe to God and my own smartness in dodging it. But let that pass; all willcome out in the scouring; for I have heard say &lsquo;he loves thee well thatmakes thee weep;&rsquo; and moreover that it is the way with great lords afterany hard words they give a servant to give him a pair of breeches; thoughI do not know what they give after blows, unless it be that knights-errantafter blows give islands, or kingdoms on the mainland.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It may be on the dice,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that all thou sayest will cometrue; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd enough to know that our firstmovements are not in our own control; and one thing for the future bear inmind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in my company; for in allthe books of chivalry that I have read, and they are innumerable, I nevermet with a squire who talked so much to his lord as thou dost to thine;and in fact I feel it to be a great fault of thine and of mine: of thine,that thou hast so little respect for me; of mine, that I do not makemyself more respected. There was Gandalin, the squire of Amadis of Gaul,that was Count of the Insula Firme, and we read of him that he alwaysaddressed his lord with his cap in his hand, his head bowed down and hisbody bent double, more turquesco. And then, what shall we say of Gasabal,the squire of Galaor, who was so silent that in order to indicate to usthe greatness of his marvellous taciturnity his name is only oncementioned in the whole of that history, as long as it is truthful? Fromall I have said thou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must be a differencebetween master and man, between lord and lackey, between knight andsquire: so that from this day forward in our intercourse we must observemore respect and take less liberties, for in whatever way I may beprovoked with you it will be bad for the pitcher. The favours and benefitsthat I have promised you will come in due time, and if they do not yourwages at least will not be lost, as I have already told you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that your worship says is very well,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but I should liketo know (in case the time of favours should not come, and it might benecessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of aknight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or bythe day like bricklayers?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not believe,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;that such squires were ever onwages, but were dependent on favour; and if I have now mentioned thine inthe sealed will I have left at home, it was with a view to what mayhappen; for as yet I know not how chivalry will turn out in these wretchedtimes of ours, and I do not wish my soul to suffer for trifles in theother world; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that in this there is nocondition more hazardous than that of adventurers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;since the mere noise of the hammers of afulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valiant errantadventurer as your worship; but you may be sure I will not open my lipshenceforward to make light of anything of your worship&rsquo;s, but only tohonour you as my master and natural lord.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By so doing,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;shalt thou live long on the face ofthe earth; for next to parents, masters are to be respected as though theywere parents.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c19e" id="c19e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c19e.jpg (33K)" src="images/c19e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF THE EXALTED ADVENTURE AND RICH PRIZE OF MAMBRINO&rsquo;S HELMET,TOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO OUR INVINCIBLE KNIGHT</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c20a" id="c20a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c20a.jpg (73K)" src="images/c20a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c20a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>It now began to rain a little, and Sancho was for going into the fullingmills, but Don Quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them on account ofthe late joke that he would not enter them on any account; so turningaside to right they came upon another road, different from that which theyhad taken the night before. Shortly afterwards Don Quixote perceived a manon horseback who wore on his head something that shone like gold, and themoment he saw him he turned to Sancho and said:</p><p>&ldquo;I think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being maximsdrawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences, especiallythat one that says, &lsquo;Where one door shuts, another opens.&rsquo; I say sobecause if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we werelooking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it now openswide another one for another better and more certain adventure, and if Ido not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and I cannot lay itto my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of the night. I say thisbecause, if I mistake not, there comes towards us one who wears on hishead the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took the oath thourememberest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do,&rdquo; saidSancho, &ldquo;for I don&rsquo;t want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling andknocking our senses out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The devil take thee, man,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;what has a helmet to dowith fulling mills?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;but, faith, if I might speak as I used,perhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see you weremistaken in what you say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?&rdquo; returned DonQuixote; &ldquo;tell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us on adappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What I see and make out,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;is only a man on a grey asslike my own, who has something that shines on his head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, that is the helmet of Mambrino,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;stand to oneside and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying aword, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue and possessmyself of the helmet I have so longed for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will take care to stand aside,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;but God grant, I say oncemore, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling millsto me again,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;or I vow&mdash;and I say no more&mdash;I&rsquo;llfull the soul out of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow hehad hurled like a bowl at him.</p><p>The fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight that DonQuixote saw, was this. In that neighbourhood there were two villages, oneof them so small that it had neither apothecary&rsquo;s shop nor barber, whichthe other that was close to it had, so the barber of the larger served thesmaller, and in it there was a sick man who required to be bled andanother man who wanted to be shaved, and on this errand the barber wasgoing, carrying with him a brass basin; but as luck would have it, as hewas on the way it began to rain, and not to spoil his hat, which probablywas a new one, he put the basin on his head, and being clean it glitteredat half a league&rsquo;s distance. He rode upon a grey ass, as Sancho said, andthis was what made it seem to Don Quixote to be a dapple-grey steed and aknight and a golden helmet; for everything he saw he made to fall in withhis crazy chivalry and ill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor knightdraw near, without entering into any parley with him, at Rocinante&rsquo;s topspeed he bore down upon him with the pike pointed low, fully determined torun him through and through, and as he reached him, without checking thefury of his charge, he cried to him:</p><p>&ldquo;Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord thatwhich is so reasonably my due.&rdquo;</p><p>The barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw thisapparition coming down upon him, had no other way of saving himself fromthe stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; and no soonerhad he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than a deer andsped away across the plain faster than the wind.</p><p>He left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented himself,saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated the beaver,which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts off with itsteeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it is pursued.</p><p>He told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his hands said:</p><p>&ldquo;By God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it is wortha maravedis,&rdquo; and handed it to his master, who immediately put it on hishead, turning it round, now this way, now that, in search of fitment, andnot finding it he said, &ldquo;Clearly the pagan to whose measure this famoushead-piece was first forged must have had a very large head; but the worstof it is half of it is wanting.&rdquo;</p><p>When Sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable to restrainhis laughter, but remembering his master&rsquo;s wrath he checked himself in themidst of it.</p><p>&ldquo;What art thou laughing at, Sancho?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;I am laughing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to think of the great head the pagan must havehad who owned this helmet, for it looks exactly like a regular barber&rsquo;sbasin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;that thiswonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accidenthave come into the hands of someone who was unable to recognise orrealise its value, and who, not knowing what he did, and seeing it to beof the purest gold, must have melted down one half for the sake of what itmight be worth, and of the other made this which is like a barber&rsquo;s basinas thou sayest; but be it as it may, to me who recognise it, itstransformation makes no difference, for I will set it to rights at thefirst village where there is a blacksmith, and in such style that thathelmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battles shall not surpassit or even come up to it; and in the meantime I will wear it as well as Ican, for something is better than nothing; all the more as it will bequite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a stone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;if it is not shot with a sling as they were inthe battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross on your worship&rsquo;sgrinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that made mevomit my bowels up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It does not grieve me much to have lost it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for thouknowest, Sancho, that I have the receipt in my memory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;but if ever I make it, or try it again aslong as I live, may this be my last hour; moreover, I have no intention ofputting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean, with all my fivesenses, to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding anyone: as tobeing blanketed again I say nothing, for it is hard to prevent mishaps ofthat sort, and if they come there is nothing for it but to squeeze ourshoulders together, hold our breath, shut our eyes, and let ourselves gowhere luck and the blanket may send us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote on hearing this, &ldquo;foronce an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it: but know thatit is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach importance totrifles. What lame leg hast thou got by it, what broken rib, what crackedhead, that thou canst not forget that jest? For jest and sport it was,properly regarded, and had I not seen it in that light I would havereturned and done more mischief in revenging thee than the Greeks did forthe rape of Helen, who, if she were alive now, or if my Dulcinea had livedthen, might depend upon it she would not be so famous for her beauty asshe is;&rdquo; and here he heaved a sigh and sent it aloft; and said Sancho,&ldquo;Let it pass for a jest as it cannot be revenged in earnest, but I knowwhat sort of jest and earnest it was, and I know it will never be rubbedout of my memory any more than off my shoulders. But putting that aside,will your worship tell me what are we to do with this dapple-grey steedthat looks like a grey ass, which that Martino that your worship overthrewhas left deserted here? for, from the way he took to his heels and bolted,he is not likely ever to come back for it; and by my beard but the grey isa good one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have never been in the habit,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;of taking spoil ofthose whom I vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take awaytheir horses and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that thevictor have lost his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful to takethat of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war; therefore, Sancho,leave this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be; for whenits owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God knows I should like to take it,&rdquo; returned Sancho, &ldquo;or at least tochange it for my own, which does not seem to me as good a one: verily thelaws of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to let one assbe changed for another; I should like to know if I might at least changetrappings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On that head I am not quite certain,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;and thematter being doubtful, pending better information, I say thou mayestchange them, if so be thou hast urgent need of them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So urgent is it,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;that if they were for myown person I could not want them more;&rdquo; and forthwith, fortified by thislicence, he effected the <i>mutatio capparum</i>, and rigged out his beast tothe ninety-nines and making quite another thing of it. This done, they broketheir fast on the remains of the spoils of war plundered from the sumpter mule,and drank of the brook that flowed from the fulling mills, without casting alook in that direction, in such loathing did they hold them for the alarm theyhad caused them; and, all anger and gloom removed, they mounted and, withouttaking any fixed road (not to fix upon any being the proper thing for trueknights-errant), they set out, guided by Rocinante&rsquo;s will, which carriedalong with it that of his master, not to say that of the ass, which alwaysfollowed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably; nevertheless they returnedto the high road, and pursued it at a venture without any other aim.</p><p>As they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to his master, &ldquo;Señor,would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? For since youlaid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have gone to rotin my stomach, and I have now just one on the tip of my tongue that Idon&rsquo;t want to be spoiled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say, on, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and be brief in thy discourse, forthere is no pleasure in one that is long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, señor,&rdquo; returned Sancho, &ldquo;I say that for some days past I havebeen considering how little is got or gained by going in search of theseadventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and cross-roads, where,even if the most perilous are victoriously achieved, there is no one tosee or know of them, and so they must be left untold for ever, to the lossof your worship&rsquo;s object and the credit they deserve; therefore it seemsto me it would be better (saving your worship&rsquo;s better judgment) if wewere to go and serve some emperor or other great prince who may have somewar on hand, in whose service your worship may prove the worth of yourperson, your great might, and greater understanding, on perceiving whichthe lord in whose service we may be will perforce have to reward us, eachaccording to his merits; and there you will not be at a loss for someoneto set down your achievements in writing so as to preserve their memoryfor ever. Of my own I say nothing, as they will not go beyond squirelylimits, though I make bold to say that, if it be the practice in chivalryto write the achievements of squires, I think mine must not be left out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;butbefore that point is reached it is requisite to roam the world, as it were onprobation, seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some, name and famemay be acquired, such that when he betakes himself to the court of some greatmonarch the knight may be already known by his deeds, and that the boys, theinstant they see him enter the gate of the city, may all follow him andsurround him, crying, &lsquo;This is the Knight of the Sun&rsquo;&mdash;or theSerpent, or any other title under which he may have achieved great deeds.&lsquo;This,&rsquo; they will say, &lsquo;is he who vanquished in single combatthe gigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength; he who delivered the great Mamelukeof Persia out of the long enchantment under which he had been for almost ninehundred years.&rsquo; So from one to another they will go proclaiming hisachievements; and presently at the tumult of the boys and the others the kingof that kingdom will appear at the windows of his royal palace, and as soon ashe beholds the knight, recognising him by his arms and the device on hisshield, he will as a matter of course say, &lsquo;What ho! Forth all ye, theknights of my court, to receive the flower of chivalry who comethhither!&rsquo; At which command all will issue forth, and he himself, advancinghalf-way down the stairs, will embrace him closely, and salute him, kissing himon the cheek, and will then lead him to the queen&rsquo;s chamber, where theknight will find her with the princess her daughter, who will be one of themost beautiful and accomplished damsels that could with the utmost pains bediscovered anywhere in the known world. Straightway it will come to pass thatshe will fix her eyes upon the knight and he his upon her, and each will seemto the other something more divine than human, and, without knowing how or whythey will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, and sorelydistressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their pains andsufferings known by speech. Thence they will lead him, no doubt, to some richlyadorned chamber of the palace, where, having removed his armour, they willbring him a rich mantle of scarlet wherewith to robe himself, and if he lookednoble in his armour he will look still more so in a doublet. When night comeshe will sup with the king, queen, and princess; and all the time he will nevertake his eyes off her, stealing stealthy glances, unnoticed by those present,and she will do the same, and with equal cautiousness, being, as I have said, adamsel of great discretion. The tables being removed, suddenly through the doorof the hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf followed by a fairdame, between two giants, who comes with a certain adventure, the work of anancient sage; and he who shall achieve it shall be deemed the best knight inthe world.</p><p>&ldquo;The king will then command all those present to essay it, and none willbring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to the greatenhancement of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyed and willesteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed her thoughtsso high. And the best of it is that this king, or prince, or whatever heis, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as powerful as himself,and the stranger knight, after having been some days at his court,requests leave from him to go and serve him in the said war. The king willgrant it very readily, and the knight will courteously kiss his hands forthe favour done to him; and that night he will take leave of his lady theprincess at the grating of the chamber where she sleeps, which looks upona garden, and at which he has already many times conversed with her, thego-between and confidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by theprincess. He will sigh, she will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, muchdistressed because morning approaches, and for the honour of her lady hewould not that they were discovered; at last the princess will come toherself and will present her white hands through the grating to theknight, who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathing themwith his tears. It will be arranged between them how they are to informeach other of their good or evil fortunes, and the princess will entreathim to make his absence as short as possible, which he will promise to dowith many oaths; once more he kisses her hands, and takes his leave insuch grief that he is well-nigh ready to die. He betakes him thence to hischamber, flings himself on his bed, cannot sleep for sorrow at parting,rises early in the morning, goes to take leave of the king, queen, andprincess, and, as he takes his leave of the pair, it is told him that theprincess is indisposed and cannot receive a visit; the knight thinks it isfrom grief at his departure, his heart is pierced, and he is hardly ableto keep from showing his pain. The confidante is present, observes all,goes to tell her mistress, who listens with tears and says that one of hergreatest distresses is not knowing who this knight is, and whether he isof kingly lineage or not; the damsel assures her that so much courtesy,gentleness, and gallantry of bearing as her knight possesses could notexist in any save one who was royal and illustrious; her anxiety is thusrelieved, and she strives to be of good cheer lest she should excitesuspicion in her parents, and at the end of two days she appears inpublic. Meanwhile the knight has taken his departure; he fights in thewar, conquers the king&rsquo;s enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in manybattles, returns to the court, sees his lady where he was wont to see her,and it is agreed that he shall demand her in marriage of her parents asthe reward of his services; the king is unwilling to give her, as he knowsnot who he is, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever otherway it may be, the princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes toregard it as very good fortune; for it so happens that this knight isproved to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know not what,for I fancy it is not likely to be on the map. The father dies, theprincess inherits, and in two words the knight becomes king. And herecomes in at once the bestowal of rewards upon his squire and all who haveaided him in rising to so exalted a rank. He marries his squire to adamsel of the princess&rsquo;s, who will be, no doubt, the one who wasconfidante in their amour, and is daughter of a very great duke.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want, and no mistake about it!&rdquo; said Sancho. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s whatI&rsquo;m waiting for; for all this, word for word, is in store for your worshipunder the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;for in the samemanner, and by the same steps as I have described here, knights-errantrise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all we want now is to findout what king, Christian or pagan, is at war and has a beautiful daughter;but there will be time enough to think of that, for, as I have told thee,fame must be won in other quarters before repairing to the court. There isanother thing, too, that is wanting; for supposing we find a king who isat war and has a beautiful daughter, and that I have won incredible famethroughout the universe, I know not how it can be made out that I am ofroyal lineage, or even second cousin to an emperor; for the king will notbe willing to give me his daughter in marriage unless he is firstthoroughly satisfied on this point, however much my famous deeds maydeserve it; so that by this deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm hasfairly earned. True it is I am a gentleman of known house, of estate andproperty, and entitled to the five hundred sueldos mulet; and it may bethat the sage who shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry andpedigree that I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king; forI would have thee know, Sancho, that there are two kinds of lineages inthe world; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings andprinces, whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a pointlike a pyramid upside down; and others who spring from the common herd andgo on rising step by step until they come to be great lords; so that thedifference is that the one were what they no longer are, and the othersare what they formerly were not. And I may be of such that afterinvestigation my origin may prove great and famous, with which the king,my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied; and should he notbe, the princess will so love me that even though she well knew me to bethe son of a water-carrier, she will take me for her lord and husband inspite of her father; if not, then it comes to seizing her and carrying heroff where I please; for time or death will put an end to the wrath of herparents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It comes to this, too,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;what some naughty people say,&lsquo;Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;&rsquo; though it would fitbetter to say, &lsquo;A clear escape is better than good men&rsquo;s prayers.&rsquo; I sayso because if my lord the king, your worship&rsquo;s father-in-law, will notcondescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothing for it but,as your worship says, to seize her and transport her. But the mischief isthat until peace is made and you come into the peaceful enjoyment of yourkingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far as rewards go, unless it bethat the confidante damsel that is to be his wife comes with the princess,and that with her he tides over his bad luck until Heaven otherwise ordersthings; for his master, I suppose, may as well give her to him at once fora lawful wife.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody can object to that,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Then since that may be,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;there is nothing for it but tocommend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;and mean be he who thinks himself mean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name let him be so,&rdquo; said Sancho: &ldquo;I am an old Christian, and tofit me for a count that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And more than enough for thee,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;and even wert thounot, it would make no difference, because I being the king can easily givethee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee, for when Imake thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and they may saywhat they will, but by my faith they will have to call thee &lsquo;yourlordship,&rsquo; whether they like it or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a doubt of it; and I&rsquo;ll know how to support the tittle,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Title thou shouldst say, not tittle,&rdquo; said his master.</p><p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; answered Sancho. &ldquo;I say I will know how to behave, for once inmy life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle&rsquo;s gown sat so wellon me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the samebrotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke&rsquo;s robe on my back,or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? I believe they&rsquo;ll come ahundred leagues to see me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou wilt look well,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;but thou must shave thy beardoften, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou dostnot shave it every second day at least, they will see what thou art at thedistance of a musket shot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What more will it be,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;than having a barber, and keepinghim at wages in the house? and even if it be necessary, I will make him gobehind me like a nobleman&rsquo;s equerry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?&rdquo; askedDon Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; answered Sancho. &ldquo;Years ago I was for a month at thecapital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who theysaid was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in everyturn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this man did notjoin the other man, instead of always going behind him; they answered methat he was his equerry, and that it was the custom with nobles to havesuch persons behind them, and ever since then I know it, for I have neverforgotten it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art right,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and in the same way thou mayest carrythy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all together, norwere they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the first count to havea barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one&rsquo;s beard is a greatertrust than saddling one&rsquo;s horse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let the barber business be my look-out,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;and your worship&rsquo;sbe it to strive to become a king, and make me a count.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it shall be,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he saw whatwill be told in the following chapter.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c20e" id="c20e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c20e.jpg (18K)" src="images/c20e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br/>OF THE FREEDOM DON QUIXOTE CONFERRED ON SEVERAL UNFORTUNATES WHO AGAINSTTHEIR WILL WERE BEING CARRIED WHERE THEY HAD NO WISH TO GO</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c22a" id="c22a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c22a.jpg (178K)" src="images/c22a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c22a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Cid Hamete Benengeli, the Arab and Manchegan author, relates in this mostgrave, high-sounding, minute, delightful, and original history that afterthe discussion between the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha and his squireSancho Panza which is set down at the end of chapter twenty-one, DonQuixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the road he was followingsome dozen men on foot strung together by the neck, like beads, on a greatiron chain, and all with manacles on their hands. With them there camealso two men on horseback and two on foot; those on horseback withwheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelins and swords, and as soon asSancho saw them he said:</p><p>&ldquo;That is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by force ofthe king&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How by force?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote; &ldquo;is it possible that the king usesforce against anyone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not say that,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;but that these are people condemnedfor their crimes to serve by force in the king&rsquo;s galleys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;however it may be, these people are goingwhere they are taking them by force, and not of their own will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Then if so,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;here is a case for the exercise of myoffice, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Recollect, your worship,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;Justice, which is the kinghimself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, but punishingthem for their crimes.&rdquo;</p><p>The chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote invery courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be goodenough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were conductingthese people in this manner. One of the guards on horseback answered thatthey were galley slaves belonging to his majesty, that they were going tothe galleys, and that was all that was to be said and all he had anybusiness to know.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c22b" id="c22b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c22b.jpg (298K)" src="images/c22b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c22b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;I should like to know from each ofthem separately the reason of his misfortune;&rdquo; to this he added more tothe same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civilly thatthe other mounted guard said to him:</p><p>&ldquo;Though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of everyone of these wretches, this is no time to take them out or read them; comeand ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and they will, for thesefellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about rascalities.&rdquo;</p><p>With this permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had they notgranted it, he approached the chain and asked the first for what offenceshe was now in such a sorry case.</p><p>He made answer that it was for being a lover.</p><p>&ldquo;For that only?&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;why, if for being lovers they sendpeople to the galleys I might have been rowing in them long ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The love is not the sort your worship is thinking of,&rdquo; said the galleyslave; &ldquo;mine was that I loved a washerwoman&rsquo;s basket of clean linen sowell, and held it so close in my embrace, that if the arm of the law hadnot forced it from me, I should never have let it go of my own will tothis moment; I was caught in the act, there was no occasion for torture,the case was settled, they treated me to a hundred lashes on the back, andthree years of gurapas besides, and that was the end of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are gurapas?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Gurapas are galleys,&rdquo; answered the galley slave, who was a young man ofabout four-and-twenty, and said he was a native of Piedrahita.</p><p>Don Quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply, sodowncast and melancholy was he; but the first answered for him, and said,&ldquo;He, sir, goes as a canary, I mean as a musician and a singer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for being musicians and singers are people sentto the galleys too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the galley slave, &ldquo;for there is nothing worse thansinging under suffering.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I have heard say,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that he who singsscares away his woes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here it is the reverse,&rdquo; said the galley slave; &ldquo;for he who sings onceweeps all his life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not understand it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; but one of the guardssaid to him, &ldquo;Sir, to sing under suffering means with the <i>nonsancta</i> fraternity to confess under torture; they put this sinner to thetorture and he confessed his crime, which was being a cuatrero, that is acattle-stealer, and on his confession they sentenced him to six years in thegalleys, besides two hundred lashes that he has already had on the back; and heis always dejected and downcast because the other thieves that were left behindand that march here ill-treat, and snub, and jeer, and despise him forconfessing and not having spirit enough to say nay; for, say they,&lsquo;nay&rsquo; has no more letters in it than &lsquo;yea,&rsquo; and aculprit is well off when life or death with him depends on his own tongue andnot on that of witnesses or evidence; and to my thinking they are not very farout.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I think so too,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote; then passing on to the thirdhe asked him what he had asked the others, and the man answered veryreadily and unconcernedly, &ldquo;I am going for five years to their ladyshipsthe gurapas for the want of ten ducats.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble,&rdquo; saidDon Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the galley slave, &ldquo;is like a man having money at sea when heis dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants; I say sobecause if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that yourworship now offers me, I would have greased the notary&rsquo;s pen and freshenedup the attorney&rsquo;s wit with them, so that to-day I should be in the middleof the plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo, and not on this road coupled likea greyhound. But God is great; patience&mdash;there, that&rsquo;s enough of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with awhite beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked thereason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, but thefifth acted as his tongue and said, &ldquo;This worthy man is going to thegalleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony and onhorseback.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That means,&rdquo; said Sancho Panza, &ldquo;as I take it, to have been exposed toshame in public.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; replied the galley slave, &ldquo;and the offence for which they gavehim that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay body-broker; Imean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and for having besidesa certain touch of the sorcerer about him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If that touch had not been thrown in,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;he would notdeserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to commandand be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one, beingthe office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in a well-orderedstate, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth; nay, there oughtto be an inspector and overseer of them, as in other offices, andrecognised number, as with the brokers on change; in this way many of theevils would be avoided which are caused by this office and calling beingin the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such as women more or lesssilly, and pages and jesters of little standing and experience, who on themost urgent occasions, and when ingenuity of contrivance is needed, letthe crumbs freeze on the way to their mouths, and know not which is theirright hand. I should like to go farther, and give reasons to show that itis advisable to choose those who are to hold so necessary an office in thestate, but this is not the fit place for it; some day I will expound thematter to someone able to see to and rectify it; all I say now is, thatthe additional fact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gaveme to see these white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful aposition on account of his being a pimp; though I know well there are nosorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some simplefolk fancy, for our will is free, nor is there herb or charm that canforce it. All that certain silly women and quacks do is to turn men madwith potions and poisons, pretending that they have power to cause love,for, as I say, it is an impossibility to compel the will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said the good old man, &ldquo;and indeed, sir, as far as thecharge of sorcery goes I was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp Icannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for myonly object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in peaceand quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentions wereunavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back from,with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that never givesme a moment&rsquo;s ease;&rdquo; and again he fell to weeping as before, and suchcompassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out a real of four fromhis bosom and gave it to him in alms.</p><p>Don Quixote went on and asked another what his crime was, and the mananswered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the lastone.</p><p>&ldquo;I am here because I carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins ofmine, and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine; in short,I carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such acomplicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear: itwas all proved against me, I got no favour, I had no money, I was nearhaving my neck stretched, they sentenced me to the galleys for six years,I accepted my fate, it is the punishment of my fault; I am a young man;let life only last, and with that all will come right. If you, sir, haveanything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay it to you in heaven,and we on earth will take care in our petitions to him to pray for thelife and health of your worship, that they may be as long and as good asyour amiable appearance deserves.&rdquo;</p><p>This one was in the dress of a student, and one of the guards said he wasa great talker and a very elegant Latin scholar.</p><p>Behind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow,except that when he looked, his eyes turned in a little one towards theother. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg achain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings on hisneck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a&ldquo;keep-friend&rdquo; or &ldquo;friend&rsquo;s foot,&rdquo; from which hung two irons reaching tohis waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were securedby a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands to his mouthnor lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why this man carried somany more chains than the others. The guard replied that it was because healone had committed more crimes than all the rest put together, and was sodaring and such a villain, that though they marched him in that fashionthey did not feel sure of him, but were in dread of his making his escape.</p><p>&ldquo;What crimes can he have committed,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;if they have notdeserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He goes for ten years,&rdquo; replied the guard, &ldquo;which is the same thing ascivil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is thefamous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gently, señor commissary,&rdquo; said the galley slave at this, &ldquo;let us have nofixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and myfamily name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one mind hisown business, and he will be doing enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Speak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure,&rdquo; replied thecommissary, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t want me to make you hold your tongue in spite ofyour teeth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is easy to see,&rdquo; returned the galley slave, &ldquo;that man goes as Godpleases, but someone shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillo deParapilla or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they call you so, you liar?&rdquo; said the guard.</p><p>&ldquo;They do,&rdquo; returned Gines, &ldquo;but I will make them give over calling me so,or I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth. If you, sir, haveanything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speed you, for you arebecoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about the lives of others;if you want to know about mine, let me tell you I am Gines de Pasamonte,whose life is written by these fingers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He says true,&rdquo; said the commissary, &ldquo;for he has himself written his storyas grand as you please, and has left the book in the prison in pawn fortwo hundred reals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I mean to take it out of pawn,&rdquo; said Gines, &ldquo;though it were in fortwo hundred ducats.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it so good?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;So good is it,&rdquo; replied Gines, &ldquo;that a fig for &lsquo;Lazarillo de Tormes,&rsquo; andall of that kind that have been written, or shall be written compared withit: all I will say about it is that it deals with facts, and facts so neatand diverting that no lies could match them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how is the book entitled?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Life of Gines de Pasamonte,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied the subject of it.</p><p>&ldquo;And is it finished?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;How can it be finished,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;when my life is not yetfinished? All that is written is from my birth down to the point when theysent me to the galleys this last time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you have been there before?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;In the service of God and the king I have been there for four yearsbefore now, and I know by this time what the biscuit and courbash arelike,&rdquo; replied Gines; &ldquo;and it is no great grievance to me to go back tothem, for there I shall have time to finish my book; I have still manythings left to say, and in the galleys of Spain there is more than enoughleisure; though I do not want much for what I have to write, for I have itby heart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You seem a clever fellow,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;And an unfortunate one,&rdquo; replied Gines, &ldquo;for misfortune always persecutesgood wit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It persecutes rogues,&rdquo; said the commissary.</p><p>&ldquo;I told you already to go gently, master commissary,&rdquo; saidPasamonte; &ldquo;their lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treatus wretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you; ifnot, by the life of&mdash;never mind&mdash;; it may be that some day the stainsmade in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his tongue andbehave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for we have had quiteenough of this entertainment.&rdquo;</p><p>The commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for histhreats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not to ill-usehim, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied to havehis tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he said:</p><p>&ldquo;From all you have told me, dear brethren, I make out clearly that thoughthey have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are about to enduredo not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them very much against thegrain and against your will, and that perhaps this one&rsquo;s want of courageunder torture, that one&rsquo;s want of money, the other&rsquo;s want ofadvocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the judge may have been thecause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had on yourside. All which presents itself now to my mind, urging, persuading, and evencompelling me to demonstrate in your case the purpose for which Heaven sent meinto the world and caused me to make profession of the order of chivalry towhich I belong, and the vow I took therein to give aid to those in need andunder the oppression of the strong. But as I know that it is a mark of prudencenot to do by foul means what may be done by fair, I will ask these gentlemen,the guards and commissary, to be so good as to release you and let you go inpeace, as there will be no lack of others to serve the king under morefavourable circumstances; for it seems to me a hard case to make slaves ofthose whom God and nature have made free. Moreover, sirs of the guard,&rdquo;added Don Quixote, &ldquo;these poor fellows have done nothing to you; let eachanswer for his own sins yonder; there is a God in Heaven who will not forget topunish the wicked or reward the good; and it is not fitting that honest menshould be the instruments of punishment to others, they being therein no wayconcerned. This request I make thus gently and quietly, that, if you complywith it, I may have reason for thanking you; and, if you will not voluntarily,this lance and sword together with the might of my arm shall compel you tocomply with it by force.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nice nonsense!&rdquo; said the commissary; &ldquo;a fine piece of pleasantry he hascome out with at last! He wants us to let the king&rsquo;s prisoners go, as ifwe had any authority to release them, or he to order us to do so! Go yourway, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight that you&rsquo;ve got onyour head, and don&rsquo;t go looking for three feet on a cat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, andacting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving himtime to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with alance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had themusket. The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this unexpectedevent, but recovering presence of mind, those on horseback seized theirswords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked Don Quixote, whowas waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it would have gonebadly with him if the galley slaves, seeing the chance before them ofliberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving to break thechain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion, that the guards,now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking loose, now to attackDon Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing at all that was of anyuse. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to release Gines dePasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon the plain free andunfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary, took from him hissword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and levelling at another,he, without ever discharging it, drove every one of the guards off thefield, for they took to flight, as well to escape Pasamonte&rsquo;s musket, asthe showers of stones the now released galley slaves were raining uponthem. Sancho was greatly grieved at the affair, because he anticipatedthat those who had fled would report the matter to the Holy Brotherhood,who at the summons of the alarm-bell would at once sally forth in quest ofthe offenders; and he said so to his master, and entreated him to leavethe place at once, and go into hiding in the sierra that was close by.</p><p>&ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;but I know what must be donenow;&rdquo; and calling together all the galley slaves, who were now runningriot, and had stripped the commissary to the skin, he collected them roundhim to hear what he had to say, and addressed them as follows: &ldquo;To begrateful for benefits received is the part of persons of good birth, andone of the sins most offensive to God is ingratitude; I say so because,sirs, ye have already seen by manifest proof the benefit ye have receivedof me; in return for which I desire, and it is my good pleasure that,laden with that chain which I have taken off your necks, ye at once setout and proceed to the city of El Toboso, and there present yourselvesbefore the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and say to her that her knight, he ofthe Rueful Countenance, sends to commend himself to her; and that yerecount to her in full detail all the particulars of this notableadventure, up to the recovery of your longed-for liberty; and this done yemay go where ye will, and good fortune attend you.&rdquo;</p><p>Gines de Pasamonte made answer for all, saying, &ldquo;That which you, sir, ourdeliverer, demand of us, is of all impossibilities the most impossible tocomply with, because we cannot go together along the roads, but onlysingly and separate, and each one his own way, endeavouring to hideourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape the Holy Brotherhood,which, no doubt, will come out in search of us. What your worship may do,and fairly do, is to change this service and tribute as regards the ladyDulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity of ave-marias and credos whichwe will say for your worship&rsquo;s intention, and this is a condition that canbe complied with by night as by day, running or resting, in peace or inwar; but to imagine that we are going now to return to the flesh-pots ofEgypt, I mean to take up our chain and set out for El Toboso, is toimagine that it is now night, though it is not yet ten in the morning, andto ask this of us is like asking pears of the elm tree.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then by all that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath), &ldquo;Donson of a bitch, Don Ginesillo de Paropillo, or whatever your name is, youwill have to go yourself alone, with your tail between your legs and thewhole chain on your back.&rdquo;</p><p>Pasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughlyconvinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he hadcommitted such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused inthis fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they beganto shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quite unable toprotect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no more heeded thespur than if he had been made of brass. Sancho planted himself behind hisass, and with him sheltered himself from the hailstorm that poured on bothof them. Don Quixote was unable to shield himself so well but that morepebbles than I could count struck him full on the body with such forcethat they brought him to the ground; and the instant he fell the studentpounced upon him, snatched the basin from his head, and with it struckthree or four blows on his shoulders, and as many more on the ground,knocking it almost to pieces. They then stripped him of a jacket that hewore over his armour, and they would have stripped off his stockings ifhis greaves had not prevented them. From Sancho they took his coat,leaving him in his shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves theremaining spoils of the battle, they went each one his own way, moresolicitous about keeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they dreaded, thanabout burdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselvesbefore the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. The ass and Rocinante, Sancho and DonQuixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with droopinghead, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he thought thestorm of stones that assailed them was not yet over; Rocinante stretchedbeside his master, for he too had been brought to the ground by a stone;Sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the Holy Brotherhood; and DonQuixote fuming to find himself so served by the very persons for whom hehad done so much.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c22e" id="c22e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c22e.jpg (44K)" src="images/c22e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br/>OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE SIERRA MORENA, WHICH WAS ONE OF THERAREST ADVENTURES RELATED IN THIS VERACIOUS HISTORY</h3><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c23a" id="c23a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c23a.jpg (148K)" src="images/c23a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c23a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Seeing himself served in this way, Don Quixote said to his squire, &ldquo;I havealways heard it said, Sancho, that to do good to boors is to throw waterinto the sea.

They brought back to hismemory the marvellous adventures that had befallen knights-errant in likesolitudes and wilds, and he went along reflecting on these things, soabsorbed and carried away by them that he had no thought for anythingelse.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c23e" id="c23e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c23e.jpg (280K)" src="images/c23e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c23e.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Nor had Sancho any other care (now that he fancied he was travelling in asafe quarter) than to satisfy his appetite with such remains as were leftof the clerical spoils, and so he marched behind his master laden withwhat Dapple used to carry, emptying the sack and packing his paunch, andso long as he could go that way, he would not have given a farthing tomeet with another adventure.</p><p>While so engaged he raised his eyes and saw that his master had halted,and was trying with the point of his pike to lift some bulky object thatlay upon the ground, on which he hastened to join him and help him if itwere needful, and reached him just as with the point of the pike he wasraising a saddle-pad with a valise attached to it, half or rather whollyrotten and torn; but so heavy were they that Sancho had to help to takethem up, and his master directed him to see what the valise contained.Sancho did so with great alacrity, and though the valise was secured by achain and padlock, from its torn and rotten condition he was able to seeits contents, which were four shirts of fine holland, and other articlesof linen no less curious than clean; and in a handkerchief he found a goodlot of gold crowns, and as soon as he saw them he exclaimed:</p><p>&ldquo;Blessed be all Heaven for sending us an adventure that is good forsomething!&rdquo;</p><p>Searching further he found a little memorandum book richly bound; this DonQuixote asked of him, telling him to take the money and keep it forhimself. Sancho kissed his hands for the favour, and cleared the valise ofits linen, which he stowed away in the provision sack. Considering thewhole matter, Don Quixote observed:</p><p>&ldquo;It seems to me, Sancho&mdash;and it is impossible it can be otherwise&mdash;thatsome strayed traveller must have crossed this sierra and been attacked andslain by footpads, who brought him to this remote spot to bury him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That cannot be,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;because if they had been robbers theywould not have left this money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art right,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and I cannot guess or explain whatthis may mean; but stay; let us see if in this memorandum book there isanything written by which we may be able to trace out or discover what wewant to know.&rdquo;</p><p>He opened it, and the first thing he found in it, written roughly but in avery good hand, was a sonnet, and reading it aloud that Sancho might hearit, he found that it ran as follows:</p><p class="poem">SONNET<br/><br/>Or Love is lacking in intelligence,<br/>Or to the height of cruelty attains,<br/>Or else it is my doom to suffer pains<br/>Beyond the measure due to my offence.<br/>But if Love be a God, it follows thence<br/>That he knows all, and certain it remains<br/>No God loves cruelty; then who ordains<br/>This penance that enthrals while it torments?<br/>It were a falsehood, Chloe, thee to name;<br/>Such evil with such goodness cannot live;<br/>And against Heaven I dare not charge the blame,<br/>I only know it is my fate to die.<br/>To him who knows not whence his malady<br/>A miracle alone a cure can give.<br/></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c23f" id="c23f"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c23f.jpg (344K)" src="images/c23f.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c23f.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;There is nothing to be learned from that rhyme,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;unless bythat clue there&rsquo;s in it, one may draw out the ball of the whole matter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What clue is there?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought your worship spoke of a clue in it,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;I only said Chloe,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;and that no doubt, is the nameof the lady of whom the author of the sonnet complains; and, faith, hemust be a tolerable poet, or I know little of the craft.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then your worship understands rhyming too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And better than thou thinkest,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;as thou shalt seewhen thou carriest a letter written in verse from beginning to end to mylady Dulcinea del Toboso, for I would have thee know, Sancho, that all ormost of the knights-errant in days of yore were great troubadours andgreat musicians, for both of these accomplishments, or more properlyspeaking gifts, are the peculiar property of lovers-errant: true it isthat the verses of the knights of old have more spirit than neatness inthem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Read more, your worship,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and you will find something thatwill enlighten us.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote turned the page and said, &ldquo;This is prose and seems to be aletter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A correspondence letter, señor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From the beginning it seems to be a love letter,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Then let your worship read it aloud,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for I am very fond oflove matters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, and reading it aloud as Sancho hadrequested him, he found it ran thus:</p><p class="letter">Thy false promise and my sure misfortune carry me to a place whence thenews of my death will reach thy ears before the words of my complaint.Ungrateful one, thou hast rejected me for one more wealthy, but not moreworthy; but if virtue were esteemed wealth I should neither envy thefortunes of others nor weep for misfortunes of my own. What thy beautyraised up thy deeds have laid low; by it I believed thee to be an angel,by them I know thou art a woman. Peace be with thee who hast sent war tome, and Heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever hidden fromthee, so that thou repent not of what thou hast done, and I reap not arevenge I would not have.</p><p>When he had finished the letter, Don Quixote said, &ldquo;There is less to begathered from this than from the verses, except that he who wrote it issome rejected lover;&rdquo; and turning over nearly all the pages of the book hefound more verses and letters, some of which he could read, while othershe could not; but they were all made up of complaints, laments,misgivings, desires and aversions, favours and rejections, some rapturous,some doleful. While Don Quixote examined the book, Sancho examined thevalise, not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in the pad that he didnot search, peer into, and explore, or seam that he did not rip, or tuftof wool that he did not pick to pieces, lest anything should escape forwant of care and pains; so keen was the covetousness excited in him by thediscovery of the crowns, which amounted to near a hundred; and though hefound no more booty, he held the blanket flights, balsam vomits, stakebenedictions, carriers&rsquo; fisticuffs, missing alforjas, stolen coat, and allthe hunger, thirst, and weariness he had endured in the service of hisgood master, cheap at the price; as he considered himself more than fullyindemnified for all by the payment he received in the gift of thetreasure-trove.</p><p>The Knight of the Rueful Countenance was still very anxious to find outwho the owner of the valise could be, conjecturing from the sonnet andletter, from the money in gold, and from the fineness of the shirts, thathe must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of hislady had driven to some desperate course; but as in that uninhabited andrugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he could inquire, he sawnothing else for it but to push on, taking whatever road Rocinante chose&mdash;whichwas where he could make his way&mdash;firmly persuaded that among thesewilds he could not fail to meet some rare adventure. As he went along,then, occupied with these thoughts, he perceived on the summit of a heightthat rose before their eyes a man who went springing from rock to rock andfrom tussock to tussock with marvellous agility. As well as he could makeout he was unclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled hair, and barelegs and feet, his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawnyvelvet but so ragged that they showed his skin in several places.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c23g" id="c23g"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c23g.jpg (360K)" src="images/c23g.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c23g.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>He was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passedas has been described, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance observed andnoted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt, he was unable tofollow him, for it was not granted to the feebleness of Rocinante to makeway over such rough ground, he being, moreover, slow-paced and sluggish bynature. Don Quixote at once came to the conclusion that this was the ownerof the saddle-pad and of the valise, and made up his mind to go in searchof him, even though he should have to wander a year in those mountainsbefore he found him, and so he directed Sancho to take a short cut overone side of the mountain, while he himself went by the other, and perhapsby this means they might light upon this man who had passed so quickly outof their sight.</p><p>&ldquo;I could not do that,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for when I separate from your worshipfear at once lays hold of me, and assails me with all sorts of panics andfancies; and let what I now say be a notice that from this time forth I amnot going to stir a finger&rsquo;s width from your presence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It shall be so,&rdquo; said he of the Rueful Countenance, &ldquo;and I am very gladthat thou art willing to rely on my courage, which will never fail thee,even though the soul in thy body fail thee; so come on now behind meslowly as well as thou canst, and make lanterns of thine eyes; let us makethe circuit of this ridge; perhaps we shall light upon this man that wesaw, who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found.&rdquo;</p><p>To which Sancho made answer, &ldquo;Far better would it be not to look for him,for, if we find him, and he happens to be the owner of the money, it isplain I must restore it; it would be better, therefore, that withouttaking this needless trouble, I should keep possession of it until in someother less meddlesome and officious way the real owner may be discovered;and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it, and then the kingwill hold me harmless.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art wrong there, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for now that we have asuspicion who the owner is, and have him almost before us, we are bound toseek him and make restitution; and if we do not see him, the strongsuspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty as if hewere so; and so, friend Sancho, let not our search for him give thee anyuneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine.&rdquo;</p><p>And so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and Sancho followed him on footand loaded, and after having partly made the circuit of the mountain theyfound lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogs and pecked byjackdaws, a mule saddled and bridled, all which still further strengthenedtheir suspicion that he who had fled was the owner of the mule and thesaddle-pad.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c23h" id="c23h"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c23h.jpg (381K)" src="images/c23h.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c23h.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>As they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a shepherdwatching his flock, and suddenly on their left there appeared a greatnumber of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain the goatherdin charge of them, a man advanced in years. Don Quixote called aloud tohim and begged him to come down to where they stood. He shouted in return,asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom or never trodden exceptby the feet of goats, or of the wolves and other wild beasts that roamedaround. Sancho in return bade him come down, and they would explain all tohim.</p><p>The goatherd descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood, hesaid, &ldquo;I will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead inthe hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these sixmonths; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have come upon nobody,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;nor on anything excepta saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far from this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I found it too,&rdquo; said the goatherd, &ldquo;but I would not lift it nor go nearit for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for the devil iscrafty, and things rise up under one&rsquo;s feet to make one fall withoutknowing why or wherefore.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I say,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I found it too, and I would notgo within a stone&rsquo;s throw of it; there I left it, and there it lies justas it was, for I don&rsquo;t want a dog with a bell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, good man,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;do you know who is the owner ofthis property?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All I can tell you,&rdquo; said the goatherd, &ldquo;is that about six months ago,more or less, there arrived at a shepherd&rsquo;s hut three leagues, perhaps,away from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted onthat same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad andvalise which you say you found and did not touch. He asked us what part ofthis sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it was wherewe now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half a leaguefarther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; and I amwondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no road or paththat leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing our answer the youthturned about and made for the place we pointed out to him, leaving us allcharmed with his good looks, and wondering at his question and the hastewith which we saw him depart in the direction of the sierra; and afterthat we saw him no more, until some days afterwards he crossed the path ofone of our shepherds, and without saying a word to him, came up to him andgave him several cuffs and kicks, and then turned to the ass with ourprovisions and took all the bread and cheese it carried, and having donethis made off back again into the sierra with extraordinary swiftness.When some of us goatherds learned this we went in search of him for abouttwo days through the most remote portion of this sierra, at the end ofwhich we found him lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. Hecame out to meet us with great gentleness, with his dress now torn and hisface so disfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised himbut that his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection wehad of them, that he was the person we were looking for. He saluted uscourteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not to wonder atseeing him going about in this guise, as it was binding upon him in orderthat he might work out a penance which for his many sins had been imposedupon him. We asked him to tell us who he was, but we were never able tofind out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in want of food,which he could not do without, to tell us where we should find him, as wewould bring it to him with all good-will and readiness; or if this werenot to his taste, at least to come and ask it of us and not take it byforce from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer, begged pardon forthe late assault, and promised for the future to ask it in God&rsquo;s namewithout offering violence to anybody. As for fixed abode, he said he hadno other than that which chance offered wherever night might overtake him;and his words ended in an outburst of weeping so bitter that we wholistened to him must have been very stones had we not joined him in it,comparing what we saw of him the first time with what we saw now; for, asI said, he was a graceful and gracious youth, and in his courteous andpolished language showed himself to be of good birth and courtly breeding,and rustics as we were that listened to him, even to our rusticity hisgentle bearing sufficed to make it plain.</p><p>&ldquo;But in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent,keeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time, during which westood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this abstraction;and with no little pity, for from his behaviour, now staring at the groundwith fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving an eyelid, again closingthem, compressing his lips and raising his eyebrows, we could perceiveplainly that a fit of madness of some kind had come upon him; and beforelong he showed that what we imagined was the truth, for he arose in a furyfrom the ground where he had thrown himself, and attacked the first hefound near him with such rage and fierceness that if we had not draggedhim off him, he would have beaten or bitten him to death, all the whileexclaiming, &lsquo;Oh faithless Fernando, here, here shalt thou pay the penaltyof the wrong thou hast done me; these hands shall tear out that heart ofthine, abode and dwelling of all iniquity, but of deceit and fraud aboveall; and to these he added other words all in effect upbraiding thisFernando and charging him with treachery and faithlessness.</p><p>&ldquo;We forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty, and withoutanother word he left us, and rushing off plunged in among these brakes andbrambles, so as to make it impossible for us to follow him; from this wesuppose that madness comes upon him from time to time, and that someonecalled Fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievous nature such asthe condition to which it had brought him seemed to show. All this hasbeen since then confirmed on those occasions, and they have been many, onwhich he has crossed our path, at one time to beg the shepherds to givehim some of the food they carry, at another to take it from them by force;for when there is a fit of madness upon him, even though the shepherdsoffer it freely, he will not accept it but snatches it from them by dintof blows; but when he is in his senses he begs it for the love of God,courteously and civilly, and receives it with many thanks and not a fewtears. And to tell you the truth, sirs,&rdquo; continued the goatherd, &ldquo;it wasyesterday that we resolved, I and four of the lads, two of them ourservants, and the other two friends of mine, to go in search of him untilwe find him, and when we do to take him, whether by force or of his ownconsent, to the town of Almodóvar, which is eight leagues from this, andthere strive to cure him (if indeed his malady admits of a cure), or learnwhen he is in his senses who he is, and if he has relatives to whom we maygive notice of his misfortune. This, sirs, is all I can say in answer towhat you have asked me; and be sure that the owner of the articles youfound is he whom you saw pass by with such nimbleness and so naked.&rdquo;</p><p>For Don Quixote had already described how he had seen the man go boundingalong the mountainside, and he was now filled with amazement at what heheard from the goatherd, and more eager than ever to discover who theunhappy madman was; and in his heart he resolved, as he had done before,to search for him all over the mountain, not leaving a corner or caveunexamined until he had found him. But chance arranged matters better thanhe expected or hoped, for at that very moment, in a gorge on the mountainthat opened where they stood, the youth he wished to find made hisappearance, coming along talking to himself in a way that would have beenunintelligible near at hand, much more at a distance. His garb was whathas been described, save that as he drew near, Don Quixote perceived thata tattered doublet which he wore was amber-tanned, from which he concludedthat one who wore such garments could not be of very low rank.</p><p>Approaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice butwith great courtesy. Don Quixote returned his salutation with equalpoliteness, and dismounting from Rocinante advanced with well-bred bearingand grace to embrace him, and held him for some time close in his arms asif he had known him for a long time. The other, whom we may call theRagged One of the Sorry Countenance, as Don Quixote was of the Rueful,after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and, placing hishands on Don Quixote&rsquo;s shoulders, stood gazing at him as if seeking to seewhether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at the sight of the face,figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixote was at the sight ofhim. To be brief, the first to speak after embracing was the Ragged One,and he said what will be told farther on.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c23i" id="c23i"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c23i.jpg (53K)" src="images/c23i.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c23i.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br/>IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIERRA MORENA</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c24a" id="c24a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c24a.jpg (151K)" src="images/c24a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c24a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The history relates that it was with the greatest attention Don Quixotelistened to the ragged knight of the Sierra, who began by saying:</p><p>&ldquo;Of a surety, señor, whoever you are, for I know you not, I thank you forthe proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me, and would I were ina condition to requite with something more than good-will that which youhave displayed towards me in the cordial reception you have given me; butmy fate does not afford me any other means of returning kindnesses done mesave the hearty desire to repay them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;is to be of service to you, so much so thatI had resolved not to quit these mountains until I had found you, andlearned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found for thatsorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem to labour;and to search for you with all possible diligence, if search had beennecessary. And if your misfortune should prove to be one of those thatrefuse admission to any sort of consolation, it was my purpose to join youin lamenting and mourning over it, so far as I could; for it is still somecomfort in misfortune to find one who can feel for it. And if my goodintentions deserve to be acknowledged with any kind of courtesy, I entreatyou, señor, by that which I perceive you possess in so high a degree, andlikewise conjure you by whatever you love or have loved best in life, totell me who you are and the cause that has brought you to live or die inthese solitudes like a brute beast, dwelling among them in a manner soforeign to your condition as your garb and appearance show. And I swear,&rdquo;added Don Quixote, &ldquo;by the order of knighthood which I have received, andby my vocation of knight-errant, if you gratify me in this, to serve youwith all the zeal my calling demands of me, either in relieving yourmisfortune if it admits of relief, or in joining you in lamenting it as Ipromised to do.&rdquo;</p><p>The Knight of the Thicket, hearing him of the Rueful Countenance talk inthis strain, did nothing but stare at him, and stare at him again, andagain survey him from head to foot; and when he had thoroughly examinedhim, he said to him:</p><p>&ldquo;If you have anything to give me to eat, for God&rsquo;s sake give it me, andafter I have eaten I will do all you ask in acknowledgment of the goodwillyou have displayed towards me.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho from his sack, and the goatherd from his pouch, furnished theRagged One with the means of appeasing his hunger, and what they gave himhe ate like a half-witted being, so hastily that he took no time betweenmouthfuls, gorging rather than swallowing; and while he ate neither he northey who observed him uttered a word. As soon as he had done he made signsto them to follow him, which they did, and he led them to a green plotwhich lay a little farther off round the corner of a rock. On reaching ithe stretched himself upon the grass, and the others did the same, allkeeping silence, until the Ragged One, settling himself in his place,said:</p><p>&ldquo;If it is your wish, sirs, that I should disclose in a few words thesurpassing extent of my misfortunes, you must promise not to break thethread of my sad story with any question or other interruption, for theinstant you do so the tale I tell will come to an end.&rdquo;</p><p>These words of the Ragged One reminded Don Quixote of the tale his squirehad told him, when he failed to keep count of the goats that had crossedthe river and the story remained unfinished; but to return to the RaggedOne, he went on to say:</p><p>&ldquo;I give you this warning because I wish to pass briefly over the story ofmy misfortunes, for recalling them to memory only serves to add freshones, and the less you question me the sooner shall I make an end of therecital, though I shall not omit to relate anything of importance in orderfully to satisfy your curiosity.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote gave the promise for himself and the others, and with thisassurance he began as follows:</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Cardenio, my birthplace one of the best cities of thisAndalusia, my family noble, my parents rich, my misfortune so great thatmy parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without being ableby their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune can do little torelieve reverses sent by Heaven. In that same country there was a heavenin which love had placed all the glory I could desire; such was the beautyof Luscinda, a damsel as noble and as rich as I, but of happier fortunes,and of less firmness than was due to so worthy a passion as mine. ThisLuscinda I loved, worshipped, and adored from my earliest and tenderestyears, and she loved me in all the innocence and sincerity of childhood.Our parents were aware of our feelings, and were not sorry to perceivethem, for they saw clearly that as they ripened they must lead at last toa marriage between us, a thing that seemed almost prearranged by theequality of our families and wealth. We grew up, and with our growth grewthe love between us, so that the father of Luscinda felt bound forpropriety&rsquo;s sake to refuse me admission to his house, in this perhapsimitating the parents of that Thisbe so celebrated by the poets, and thisrefusal but added love to love and flame to flame; for though theyenforced silence upon our tongues they could not impose it upon our pens,which can make known the heart&rsquo;s secrets to a loved one more freely thantongues; for many a time the presence of the object of love shakes thefirmest will and strikes dumb the boldest tongue. Ah heavens! how manyletters did I write her, and how many dainty modest replies did I receive!how many ditties and love-songs did I compose in which my heart declaredand made known its feelings, described its ardent longings, revelled inits recollections and dallied with its desires! At length growingimpatient and feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her, Iresolved to put into execution and carry out what seemed to me the bestmode of winning my desired and merited reward, to ask her of her fatherfor my lawful wife, which I did. To this his answer was that he thanked mefor the disposition I showed to do honour to him and to regard myself ashonoured by the bestowal of his treasure; but that as my father was aliveit was his by right to make this demand, for if it were not in accordancewith his full will and pleasure, Luscinda was not to be taken or given bystealth. I thanked him for his kindness, reflecting that there was reasonin what he said, and that my father would assent to it as soon as I shouldtell him, and with that view I went the very same instant to let him knowwhat my desires were. When I entered the room where he was I found himwith an open letter in his hand, which, before I could utter a word, hegave me, saying, &lsquo;By this letter thou wilt see, Cardenio, the dispositionthe Duke Ricardo has to serve thee.&rsquo; This Duke Ricardo, as you, sirs,probably know already, is a grandee of Spain who has his seat in the bestpart of this Andalusia. I took and read the letter, which was couched interms so flattering that even I myself felt it would be wrong in my fathernot to comply with the request the duke made in it, which was that hewould send me immediately to him, as he wished me to become the companion,not servant, of his eldest son, and would take upon himself the charge ofplacing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he held me.On reading the letter my voice failed me, and still more when I heard myfather say, &lsquo;Two days hence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, in accordance withthe duke&rsquo;s wish, and give thanks to God who is opening a road to thee bywhich thou mayest attain what I know thou dost deserve; and to these wordshe added others of fatherly counsel. The time for my departure arrived; Ispoke one night to Luscinda, I told her all that had occurred, as I didalso to her father, entreating him to allow some delay, and to defer thedisposal of her hand until I should see what the Duke Ricardo sought ofme: he gave me the promise, and she confirmed it with vows and swooningsunnumbered. Finally, I presented myself to the duke, and was received andtreated by him so kindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the oldservants growing envious of me, and regarding the duke&rsquo;s inclination toshow me favour as an injury to themselves. But the one to whom my arrivalgave the greatest pleasure was the duke&rsquo;s second son, Fernando by name, agallant youth, of noble, generous, and amorous disposition, who very soonmade so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody; forthough the elder was attached to me, and showed me kindness, he did notcarry his affectionate treatment to the same length as Don Fernando. It sohappened, then, that as between friends no secret remains unshared, and asthe favour I enjoyed with Don Fernando had grown into friendship, he madeall his thoughts known to me, and in particular a love affair whichtroubled his mind a little. He was deeply in love with a peasant girl, avassal of his father&rsquo;s, the daughter of wealthy parents, and herself sobeautiful, modest, discreet, and virtuous, that no one who knew her wasable to decide in which of these respects she was most highly gifted ormost excelled. The attractions of the fair peasant raised the passion ofDon Fernando to such a point that, in order to gain his object andovercome her virtuous resolutions, he determined to pledge his word to herto become her husband, for to attempt it in any other way was to attemptan impossibility. Bound to him as I was by friendship, I strove by thebest arguments and the most forcible examples I could think of to restrainand dissuade him from such a course; but perceiving I produced no effect Iresolved to make the Duke Ricardo, his father, acquainted with the matter;but Don Fernando, being sharp-witted and shrewd, foresaw and apprehendedthis, perceiving that by my duty as a good servant I was bound not to keepconcealed a thing so much opposed to the honour of my lord the duke; andso, to mislead and deceive me, he told me he could find no better way ofeffacing from his mind the beauty that so enslaved him than by absentinghimself for some months, and that he wished the absence to be effected byour going, both of us, to my father&rsquo;s house under the pretence, which hewould make to the duke, of going to see and buy some fine horses thatthere were in my city, which produces the best in the world. When I heardhim say so, even if his resolution had not been so good a one I shouldhave hailed it as one of the happiest that could be imagined, prompted bymy affection, seeing what a favourable chance and opportunity it offeredme of returning to see my Luscinda. With this thought and wish I commendedhis idea and encouraged his design, advising him to put it into executionas quickly as possible, as, in truth, absence produced its effect in spiteof the most deeply rooted feelings. But, as afterwards appeared, when hesaid this to me he had already enjoyed the peasant girl under the title ofhusband, and was waiting for an opportunity of making it known with safetyto himself, being in dread of what his father the duke would do when hecame to know of his folly. It happened, then, that as with young men loveis for the most part nothing more than appetite, which, as its finalobject is enjoyment, comes to an end on obtaining it, and that whichseemed to be love takes to flight, as it cannot pass the limit fixed bynature, which fixes no limit to true love&mdash;what I mean is that afterDon Fernando had enjoyed this peasant girl his passion subsided and hiseagerness cooled, and if at first he feigned a wish to absent himself inorder to cure his love, he was now in reality anxious to go to avoidkeeping his promise.</p><p>&ldquo;The duke gave him permission, and ordered me to accompany him; we arrivedat my city, and my father gave him the reception due to his rank; I sawLuscinda without delay, and, though it had not been dead or deadened, mylove gathered fresh life. To my sorrow I told the story of it to DonFernando, for I thought that in virtue of the great friendship he bore meI was bound to conceal nothing from him. I extolled her beauty, hergaiety, her wit, so warmly, that my praises excited in him a desire to seea damsel adorned by such attractions. To my misfortune I yielded to it,showing her to him one night by the light of a taper at a window where weused to talk to one another. As she appeared to him in her dressing-gown,she drove all the beauties he had seen until then out of his recollection;speech failed him, his head turned, he was spell-bound, and in the endlove-smitten, as you will see in the course of the story of my misfortune;and to inflame still further his passion, which he hid from me andrevealed to Heaven alone, it so happened that one day he found a note ofhers entreating me to demand her of her father in marriage, so delicate,so modest, and so tender, that on reading it he told me that in Luscindaalone were combined all the charms of beauty and understanding that weredistributed among all the other women in the world. It is true, and I ownit now, that though I knew what good cause Don Fernando had to praiseLuscinda, it gave me uneasiness to hear these praises from his mouth, andI began to fear, and with reason to feel distrust of him, for there was nomoment when he was not ready to talk of Luscinda, and he would start thesubject himself even though he dragged it in unseasonably, a circumstancethat aroused in me a certain amount of jealousy; not that I feared anychange in the constancy or faith of Luscinda; but still my fate led me toforebode what she assured me against. Don Fernando contrived always toread the letters I sent to Luscinda and her answers to me, under thepretence that he enjoyed the wit and sense of both. It so happened, then,that Luscinda having begged of me a book of chivalry to read, one that shewas very fond of, Amadis of Gaul&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned, than he said:</p><p>&ldquo;Had your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the LadyLuscinda was fond of books of chivalry, no other laudation would have beenrequisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding, for itcould not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for suchdelightful reading been wanting; so, as far as I am concerned, you needwaste no more words in describing her beauty, worth, and intelligence;for, on merely hearing what her taste was, I declare her to be the mostbeautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world; and I wish yourworship had, along with Amadis of Gaul, sent her the worthy Don Rugel ofGreece, for I know the Lady Luscinda would greatly relish Daraida andGaraya, and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd Darinel, and the admirableverses of his bucolics, sung and delivered by him with such sprightliness,wit, and ease; but a time may come when this omission can be remedied, andto rectify it nothing more is needed than for your worship to be so goodas to come with me to my village, for there I can give you more than threehundred books which are the delight of my soul and the entertainment of mylife;&mdash;though it occurs to me that I have not got one of them now,thanks to the spite of wicked and envious enchanters;&mdash;but pardon mefor having broken the promise we made not to interrupt your discourse; forwhen I hear chivalry or knights-errant mentioned, I can no more helptalking about them than the rays of the sun can help giving heat, or thoseof the moon moisture; pardon me, therefore, and proceed, for that is moreto the purpose now.&rdquo;</p><p>While Don Quixote was saying this, Cardenio allowed his head to fall uponhis breast, and seemed plunged in deep thought; and though twice DonQuixote bade him go on with his story, he neither looked up nor uttered aword in reply; but after some time he raised his head and said, &ldquo;I cannotget rid of the idea, nor will anyone in the world remove it, or make methink otherwise&mdash;and he would be a blockhead who would hold orbelieve anything else than that that arrant knave Master Elisabad madefree with Queen Madasima.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is not true, by all that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Don Quixote in high wrath,turning upon him angrily, as his way was; &ldquo;and it is a very great slander,or rather villainy. Queen Madasima was a very illustrious lady, and it isnot to be supposed that so exalted a princess would have made free with aquack; and whoever maintains the contrary lies like a great scoundrel, andI will give him to know it, on foot or on horseback, armed or unarmed, bynight or by day, or as he likes best.&rdquo;</p><p>Cardenio was looking at him steadily, and his mad fit having now come uponhim, he had no disposition to go on with his story, nor would Don Quixotehave listened to it, so much had what he had heard about Madasimadisgusted him. Strange to say, he stood up for her as if she were inearnest his veritable born lady; to such a pass had his unholy booksbrought him. Cardenio, then, being, as I said, now mad, when he heardhimself given the lie, and called a scoundrel and other insulting names,not relishing the jest, snatched up a stone that he found near him, andwith it delivered such a blow on Don Quixote&rsquo;s breast that he laid him onhis back. Sancho Panza, seeing his master treated in this fashion,attacked the madman with his closed fist; but the Ragged One received himin such a way that with a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet,and then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction; thegoatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the same fate; and having beatenand pummelled them all he left them and quietly withdrew to hishiding-place on the mountain. Sancho rose, and with the rage he felt atfinding himself so belaboured without deserving it, ran to take vengeanceon the goatherd, accusing him of not giving them warning that this man wasat times taken with a mad fit, for if they had known it they would havebeen on their guard to protect themselves. The goatherd replied that hehad said so, and that if he had not heard him, that was no fault of his.Sancho retorted, and the goatherd rejoined, and the altercation ended intheir seizing each other by the beard, and exchanging such fisticuffs thatif Don Quixote had not made peace between them, they would have knockedone another to pieces.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave me alone, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance,&rdquo; said Sancho,grappling with the goatherd, &ldquo;for of this fellow, who is a clown likemyself, and no dubbed knight, I can safely take satisfaction for theaffront he has offered me, fighting with him hand to hand like an honestman.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;but I know that he is not to blame forwhat has happened.&rdquo;</p><p>With this he pacified them, and again asked the goatherd if it would bepossible to find Cardenio, as he felt the greatest anxiety to know the endof his story. The goatherd told him, as he had told him before, that therewas no knowing of a certainty where his lair was; but that if he wanderedabout much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to fall in with himeither in or out of his senses.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c24e" id="c24e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c24e.jpg (69K)" src="images/c24e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c24e.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THE STOUT KNIGHT OF LAMANCHA IN THE SIERRA MORENA, AND OF HIS IMITATION OF THE PENANCE OFBELTENEBROS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c25a" id="c25a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c25a.jpg (168K)" src="images/c25a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c25a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote took leave of the goatherd, and once more mounting Rocinantebade Sancho follow him, which he having no ass, did very discontentedly.They proceeded slowly, making their way into the most rugged part of themountain, Sancho all the while dying to have a talk with his master, andlonging for him to begin, so that there should be no breach of theinjunction laid upon him; but unable to keep silence so long he said tohim:</p><p>&ldquo;Señor Don Quixote, give me your worship&rsquo;s blessing and dismissal, for I&rsquo;dlike to go home at once to my wife and children with whom I can at anyrate talk and converse as much as I like; for to want me to go throughthese solitudes day and night and not speak to you when I have a mind isburying me alive. If luck would have it that animals spoke as they did inthe days of Guisopete, it would not be so bad, because I could talk toRocinante about whatever came into my head, and so put up with myill-fortune; but it is a hard case, and not to be borne with patience, togo seeking adventures all one&rsquo;s life and get nothing but kicks andblanketings, brickbats and punches, and with all this to have to sew upone&rsquo;s mouth without daring to say what is in one&rsquo;s heart, just as if onewere dumb.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand thee, Sancho,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;thou art dying to havethe interdict I placed upon thy tongue removed; consider it removed, andsay what thou wilt while we are wandering in these mountains.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;let me speak now, for God knows what will happenby-and-by; and to take advantage of the permit at once, I ask, what madeyour worship stand up so for that Queen Majimasa, or whatever her name is,or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of hers or not? forif your worship had let that pass&mdash;and you were not a judge in thematter&mdash;it is my belief the madman would have gone on with his story,and the blow of the stone, and the kicks, and more than half a dozen cuffswould have been escaped.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In faith, Sancho,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;if thou knewest as I do what anhonourable and illustrious lady Queen Madasima was, I know thou wouldstsay I had great patience that I did not break in pieces the mouth thatuttered such blasphemies, for a very great blasphemy it is to say orimagine that a queen has made free with a surgeon. The truth of the storyis that that Master Elisabad whom the madman mentioned was a man of greatprudence and sound judgment, and served as governor and physician to thequeen, but to suppose that she was his mistress is nonsense deserving verysevere punishment; and as a proof that Cardenio did not know what he wassaying, remember when he said it he was out of his wits.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is what I say,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;there was no occasion for minding thewords of a madman; for if good luck had not helped your worship, and hehad sent that stone at your head instead of at your breast, a fine way weshould have been in for standing up for my lady yonder, God confound her!And then, would not Cardenio have gone free as a madman?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Against men in their senses or against madmen,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;everyknight-errant is bound to stand up for the honour of women, whoever theymay be, much more for queens of such high degree and dignity as QueenMadasima, for whom I have a particular regard on account of her amiablequalities; for, besides being extremely beautiful, she was very wise, andvery patient under her misfortunes, of which she had many; and the counseland society of the Master Elisabad were a great help and support to her inenduring her afflictions with wisdom and resignation; hence the ignorantand ill-disposed vulgar took occasion to say and think that she was hismistress; and they lie, I say it once more, and will lie two hundred timesmore, all who think and say so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I neither say nor think so,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;let them look toit; with their bread let them eat it; they have rendered account to God whetherthey misbehaved or not; I come from my vineyard, I know nothing; I am not fondof prying into other men&rsquo;s lives; he who buys and lies feels it in hispurse; moreover, naked was I born, naked I find myself, I neither lose norgain; but if they did, what is that to me? many think there are flitches wherethere are no hooks; but who can put gates to the open plain? moreover they saidof God&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God bless me,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;what a set of absurdities thou artstringing together! What has what we are talking about got to do with theproverbs thou art threading one after the other? for God&rsquo;s sake hold thytongue, Sancho, and henceforward keep to prodding thy ass and don&rsquo;t meddlein what does not concern thee; and understand with all thy five sensesthat everything I have done, am doing, or shall do, is well founded onreason and in conformity with the rules of chivalry, for I understand thembetter than all the world that profess them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;is it a good rule of chivalry that we should goastray through these mountains without path or road, looking for a madmanwho when he is found will perhaps take a fancy to finish what he began,not his story, but your worship&rsquo;s head and my ribs, and end by breakingthem altogether for us?&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c25b" id="c25b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c25b.jpg (330K)" src="images/c25b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c25b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Peace, I say again, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for let me tell thee itis not so much the desire of finding that madman that leads me into theseregions as that which I have of performing among them an achievementwherewith I shall win eternal name and fame throughout the known world;and it shall be such that I shall thereby set the seal on all that canmake a knight-errant perfect and famous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And is it very perilous, this achievement?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied he of the Rueful Countenance; &ldquo;though it may be in the dicethat we may throw deuce-ace instead of sixes; but all will depend on thydiligence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On my diligence!&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for if thou dost return soon from the placewhere I mean to send thee, my penance will be soon over, and my glory willsoon begin. But as it is not right to keep thee any longer in suspense,waiting to see what comes of my words, I would have thee know, Sancho,that the famous Amadis of Gaul was one of the most perfect knights-errant&mdash;Iam wrong to say he was one; he stood alone, the first, the only one, thelord of all that were in the world in his time. A fig for Don Belianis,and for all who say he equalled him in any respect, for, my oath upon it,they are deceiving themselves! I say, too, that when a painter desires tobecome famous in his art he endeavours to copy the originals of the rarestpainters that he knows; and the same rule holds good for all the mostimportant crafts and callings that serve to adorn a state; thus must hewho would be esteemed prudent and patient imitate Ulysses, in whose personand labours Homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence andpatience; as Virgil, too, shows us in the person of Æneas the virtue of apious son and the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain; notrepresenting or describing them as they were, but as they ought to be, soas to leave the example of their virtues to posterity. In the same wayAmadis was the polestar, day-star, sun of valiant and devoted knights,whom all we who fight under the banner of love and chivalry are bound toimitate. This, then, being so, I consider, friend Sancho, that theknight-errant who shall imitate him most closely will come nearest toreaching the perfection of chivalry. Now one of the instances in whichthis knight most conspicuously showed his prudence, worth, valour,endurance, fortitude, and love, was when he withdrew, rejected by the LadyOriana, to do penance upon the Peña Pobre, changing his name into that ofBeltenebros, a name assuredly significant and appropriate to the lifewhich he had voluntarily adopted. So, as it is easier for me to imitatehim in this than in cleaving giants asunder, cutting off serpents&rsquo; heads,slaying dragons, routing armies, destroying fleets, and breakingenchantments, and as this place is so well suited for a similar purpose, Imust not allow the opportunity to escape which now so conveniently offersme its forelock.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it in reality,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that your worship means to do insuch an out-of-the-way place as this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have I not told thee,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;that I mean toimitate Amadis here, playing the victim of despair, the madman, the maniac, soas at the same time to imitate the valiant Don Roland, when at the fountain hehad evidence of the fair Angelica having disgraced herself with Medoro andthrough grief thereat went mad, and plucked up trees, troubled the waters ofthe clear springs, slew shepherds, destroyed flocks, burned down huts, levelledhouses, dragged mares after him, and perpetrated a hundred thousand otheroutrages worthy of everlasting renown and record? And though I have nointention of imitating Roland, or Orlando, or Rotolando (for he went by allthese names), step by step in all the mad things he did, said, and thought, Iwill make a rough copy to the best of my power of all that seems to me mostessential; but perhaps I shall content myself with the simple imitation ofAmadis, who without giving way to any mischievous madness but merely to tearsand sorrow, gained as much fame as the most famous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that the knights who behaved in this wayhad provocation and cause for those follies and penances; but what causehas your worship for going mad? What lady has rejected you, or whatevidence have you found to prove that the lady Dulcinea del Toboso hasbeen trifling with Moor or Christian?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is the point,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;and that is the beauty of thisbusiness of mine; no thanks to a knight-errant for going mad when he hascause; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation, and let my ladyknow, if I do this in the dry, what I would do in the moist; moreover Ihave abundant cause in the long separation I have endured from my ladytill death, Dulcinea del Toboso; for as thou didst hear that shepherdAmbrosio say the other day, in absence all ills are felt and feared; andso, friend Sancho, waste no time in advising me against so rare, so happy,and so unheard-of an imitation; mad I am, and mad I must be until thoureturnest with the answer to a letter that I mean to send by thee to mylady Dulcinea; and if it be such as my constancy deserves, my insanity andpenance will come to an end; and if it be to the opposite effect, I shallbecome mad in earnest, and, being so, I shall suffer no more; thus inwhatever way she may answer I shall escape from the struggle andaffliction in which thou wilt leave me, enjoying in my senses the boonthou bearest me, or as a madman not feeling the evil thou bringest me. Buttell me, Sancho, hast thou got Mambrino&rsquo;s helmet safe? for I saw thee takeit up from the ground when that ungrateful wretch tried to break it inpieces but could not, by which the fineness of its temper may be seen.&rdquo;</p><p>To which Sancho made answer, &ldquo;By the living God, Sir Knight of the RuefulCountenance, I cannot endure or bear with patience some of the things thatyour worship says; and from them I begin to suspect that all you tell meabout chivalry, and winning kingdoms and empires, and giving islands, andbestowing other rewards and dignities after the custom of knights-errant,must be all made up of wind and lies, and all pigments or figments, orwhatever we may call them; for what would anyone think that heard yourworship calling a barber&rsquo;s basin Mambrino&rsquo;s helmet without ever seeing themistake all this time, but that one who says and maintains such thingsmust have his brains addled? I have the basin in my sack all dinted, and Iam taking it home to have it mended, to trim my beard in it, if, by God&rsquo;sgrace, I am allowed to see my wife and children some day or other.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look here, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;by him thou didst swear by justnow I swear thou hast the most limited understanding that any squire inthe world has or ever had. Is it possible that all this time thou hastbeen going about with me thou hast never found out that all thingsbelonging to knights-errant seem to be illusions and nonsense and ravings,and to go always by contraries? And not because it really is so, butbecause there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendance upon us thatchange and alter everything with us, and turn things as they please, andaccording as they are disposed to aid or destroy us; thus what seems tothee a barber&rsquo;s basin seems to me Mambrino&rsquo;s helmet, and to another itwill seem something else; and rare foresight it was in the sage who is onmy side to make what is really and truly Mambrino&rsquo;s helmet seem a basin toeverybody, for, being held in such estimation as it is, all the worldwould pursue me to rob me of it; but when they see it is only a barber&rsquo;sbasin they do not take the trouble to obtain it; as was plainly shown byhim who tried to break it, and left it on the ground without taking it,for, by my faith, had he known it he would never have left it behind. Keepit safe, my friend, for just now I have no need of it; indeed, I shallhave to take off all this armour and remain as naked as I was born, if Ihave a mind to follow Roland rather than Amadis in my penance.&rdquo;</p><p>Thus talking they reached the foot of a high mountain which stood like anisolated peak among the others that surrounded it. Past its base thereflowed a gentle brook, all around it spread a meadow so green andluxuriant that it was a delight to the eyes to look upon it, and foresttrees in abundance, and shrubs and flowers, added to the charms of thespot. Upon this place the Knight of the Rueful Countenance fixed hischoice for the performance of his penance, and as he beheld it exclaimedin a loud voice as though he were out of his senses:</p><p>&ldquo;This is the place, oh, ye heavens, that I select and choose for bewailingthe misfortune in which ye yourselves have plunged me: this is the spotwhere the overflowings of mine eyes shall swell the waters of yon littlebrook, and my deep and endless sighs shall stir unceasingly the leaves ofthese mountain trees, in testimony and token of the pain my persecutedheart is suffering. Oh, ye rural deities, whoever ye be that haunt thislone spot, give ear to the complaint of a wretched lover whom long absenceand brooding jealousy have driven to bewail his fate among these wilds andcomplain of the hard heart of that fair and ungrateful one, the end andlimit of all human beauty! Oh, ye wood nymphs and dryads, that dwell inthe thickets of the forest, so may the nimble wanton satyrs by whom ye arevainly wooed never disturb your sweet repose, help me to lament my hardfate or at least weary not at listening to it! Oh, Dulcinea del Toboso,day of my night, glory of my pain, guide of my path, star of my fortune,so may Heaven grant thee in full all thou seekest of it, bethink thee ofthe place and condition to which absence from thee has brought me, andmake that return in kindness that is due to my fidelity! Oh, lonely trees,that from this day forward shall bear me company in my solitude, give mesome sign by the gentle movement of your boughs that my presence is notdistasteful to you! Oh, thou, my squire, pleasant companion in myprosperous and adverse fortunes, fix well in thy memory what thou shaltsee me do here, so that thou mayest relate and report it to the sole causeof all,&rdquo; and so saying he dismounted from Rocinante, and in an instantrelieved him of saddle and bridle, and giving him a slap on the croup,said, &ldquo;He gives thee freedom who is bereft of it himself, oh steed asexcellent in deed as thou art unfortunate in thy lot; begone where thouwilt, for thou bearest written on thy forehead that neither Astolfo&rsquo;shippogriff, nor the famed Frontino that cost Bradamante so dear, couldequal thee in speed.&rdquo;</p><p>Seeing this Sancho said, &ldquo;Good luck to him who has saved us the trouble ofstripping the pack-saddle off Dapple! By my faith he would not have gonewithout a slap on the croup and something said in his praise; though if hewere here I would not let anyone strip him, for there would be nooccasion, as he had nothing of the lover or victim of despair about him,inasmuch as his master, which I was while it was God&rsquo;s pleasure, wasnothing of the sort; and indeed, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, ifmy departure and your worship&rsquo;s madness are to come off in earnest, itwill be as well to saddle Rocinante again in order that he may supply thewant of Dapple, because it will save me time in going and returning: forif I go on foot I don&rsquo;t know when I shall get there or when I shall getback, as I am, in truth, a bad walker.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I declare, Sancho,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;it shall be as thou wilt, forthy plan does not seem to me a bad one, and three days hence thou wiltdepart, for I wish thee to observe in the meantime what I do and say forher sake, that thou mayest be able to tell it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But what more have I to see besides what I have seen?&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Much thou knowest about it!&rdquo; said Don Quixote. &ldquo;I have now got to tear upmy garments, to scatter about my armour, knock my head against theserocks, and more of the same sort of thing, which thou must witness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For the love of God,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;be careful, your worship, how yougive yourself those knocks on the head, for you may come across such arock, and in such a way, that the very first may put an end to the wholecontrivance of this penance; and I should think, if indeed knocks on thehead seem necessary to you, and this business cannot be done without them,you might be content&mdash;as the whole thing is feigned, and counterfeit,and in joke&mdash;you might be content, I say, with giving them toyourself in the water, or against something soft, like cotton; and leaveit all to me; for I&rsquo;ll tell my lady that your worship knocked your headagainst a point of rock harder than a diamond.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thank thee for thy good intentions, friend Sancho,&rdquo; answered DonQuixote, &ldquo;but I would have thee know that all these things I am doing arenot in joke, but very much in earnest, for anything else would be atransgression of the ordinances of chivalry, which forbid us to tell anylie whatever under the penalties due to apostasy; and to do one thinginstead of another is just the same as lying; so my knocks on the headmust be real, solid, and valid, without anything sophisticated or fancifulabout them, and it will be needful to leave me some lint to dress mywounds, since fortune has compelled us to do without the balsam we lost.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was worse losing the ass,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;for with him lint and allwere lost; but I beg of your worship not to remind me again of thataccursed liquor, for my soul, not to say my stomach, turns at hearing thevery name of it; and I beg of you, too, to reckon as past the three daysyou allowed me for seeing the mad things you do, for I take them as seenalready and pronounced upon, and I will tell wonderful stories to my lady;so write the letter and send me off at once, for I long to return and takeyour worship out of this purgatory where I am leaving you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Purgatory dost thou call it, Sancho?&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;rather call ithell, or even worse if there be anything worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For one who is in hell,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;<i>nulla estretentio</i>, as I have heard say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not understand what <i>retentio</i> means,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Retentio</i>,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;means that whoever is in hell never comesnor can come out of it, which will be the opposite case with your worshipor my legs will be idle, that is if I have spurs to enliven Rocinante: letme once get to El Toboso and into the presence of my lady Dulcinea, and Iwill tell her such things of the follies and madnesses (for it is all one)that your worship has done and is still doing, that I will manage to makeher softer than a glove though I find her harder than a cork tree; andwith her sweet and honeyed answer I will come back through the air like awitch, and take your worship out of this purgatory that seems to be hellbut is not, as there is hope of getting out of it; which, as I have said,those in hell have not, and I believe your worship will not say anythingto the contrary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said he of the Rueful Countenance, &ldquo;but how shall wemanage to write the letter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the ass-colt order too,&rdquo; added Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;All shall be included,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;and as there is no paper, itwould be well done to write it on the leaves of trees, as the ancientsdid, or on tablets of wax; though that would be as hard to find just nowas paper. But it has just occurred to me how it may be conveniently andeven more than conveniently written, and that is in the notebook thatbelonged to Cardenio, and thou wilt take care to have it copied on paper,in a good hand, at the first village thou comest to where there is aschoolmaster, or if not, any sacristan will copy it; but see thou give itnot to any notary to copy, for they write a law hand that Satan could notmake out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But what is to be done about the signature?&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;The letters of Amadis were never signed,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;That is all very well,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but the order must needs be signed,and if it is copied they will say the signature is false, and I shall beleft without ass-colts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The order shall go signed in the same book,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and onseeing it my niece will make no difficulty about obeying it; as to theloveletter thou canst put by way of signature, &lsquo;<i>Yours till death, theKnight of the Rueful Countenance.</i>&rsquo; And it will be no great matter if it isin some other person&rsquo;s hand, for as well as I recollect Dulcinea canneither read nor write, nor in the whole course of her life has she seenhandwriting or letter of mine, for my love and hers have been alwaysplatonic, not going beyond a modest look, and even that so seldom that Ican safely swear I have not seen her four times in all these twelve yearsI have been loving her more than the light of these eyes that the earthwill one day devour; and perhaps even of those four times she has not onceperceived that I was looking at her: such is the retirement and seclusionin which her father Lorenzo Corchuelo and her mother Aldonza Nogales havebrought her up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, so!&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;Lorenzo Corchuelo&rsquo;s daughter is the lady Dulcineadel Toboso, otherwise called Aldonza Lorenzo?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She it is,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and she it is that is worthy to be lady ofthe whole universe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know her well,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and let me tell you she can fling acrowbar as well as the lustiest lad in all the town. Giver of all good!but she is a brave lass, and a right and stout one, and fit to be helpmateto any knight-errant that is or is to be, who may make her his lady: thewhoreson wench, what sting she has and what a voice! I can tell you oneday she posted herself on the top of the belfry of the village to callsome labourers of theirs that were in a ploughed field of her father&rsquo;s,and though they were better than half a league off they heard her as wellas if they were at the foot of the tower; and the best of her is that sheis not a bit prudish, for she has plenty of affability, and jokes witheverybody, and has a grin and a jest for everything. So, Sir Knight of theRueful Countenance, I say you not only may and ought to do mad freaks forher sake, but you have a good right to give way to despair and hangyourself; and no one who knows of it but will say you did well, though thedevil should take you; and I wish I were on my road already, simply to seeher, for it is many a day since I saw her, and she must be altered by thistime, for going about the fields always, and the sun and the air spoilwomen&rsquo;s looks greatly. But I must own the truth to your worship, Señor DonQuixote; until now I have been under a great mistake, for I believed trulyand honestly that the lady Dulcinea must be some princess your worship wasin love with, or some person great enough to deserve the rich presents youhave sent her, such as the Biscayan and the galley slaves, and many moreno doubt, for your worship must have won many victories in the time when Iwas not yet your squire. But all things considered, what good can it dothe lady Aldonza Lorenzo, I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, to have thevanquished your worship sends or will send coming to her and going down ontheir knees before her? Because maybe when they came she&rsquo;d be hacklingflax or threshing on the threshing floor, and they&rsquo;d be ashamed to seeher, and she&rsquo;d laugh, or resent the present.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have before now told thee many times, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;that thou art a mighty great chatterer, and that with a blunt wit thouart always striving at sharpness; but to show thee what a fool thou art and howrational I am, I would have thee listen to a short story. Thou must know that acertain widow, fair, young, independent, and rich, and above all free and easy,fell in love with a sturdy strapping young lay-brother; his superior came toknow of it, and one day said to the worthy widow by way of brotherlyremonstrance, &lsquo;I am surprised, señora, and not without good reason, thata woman of such high standing, so fair, and so rich as you are, should havefallen in love with such a mean, low, stupid fellow as So-and-so, when in thishouse there are so many masters, graduates, and divinity students from amongwhom you might choose as if they were a lot of pears, saying, &lsquo;This oneI&rsquo;ll take, that I won&rsquo;t take;&rsquo; but she replied to him withgreat sprightliness and candour, &lsquo;My dear sir, you are very muchmistaken, and your ideas are very old-fashioned, if you think that I have madea bad choice in So-and-so, fool as he seems; because for all I want with him heknows as much and more philosophy than Aristotle.&rsquo; In the same way,Sancho, for all I want with Dulcinea del Toboso she is just as good as the mostexalted princess on earth. It is not to be supposed that all those poets whosang the praises of ladies under the fancy names they give them, had any suchmistresses. Thinkest thou that the Amarillises, the Phillises, the Sylvias, theDianas, the Galateas, the Fílidas, and all the rest of them, that the books,the ballads, the barber&rsquo;s shops, the theatres are full of, were reallyand truly ladies of flesh and blood, and mistresses of those that glorify andhave glorified them? Nothing of the kind; they only invent them for the mostpart to furnish a subject for their verses, and that they may pass for lovers,or for men valiant enough to be so; and so it suffices me to think and believethat the good Aldonza Lorenzo is fair and virtuous; and as to her pedigree itis very little matter, for no one will examine into it for the purpose ofconferring any order upon her, and I, for my part, reckon her the most exaltedprincess in the world. For thou shouldst know, Sancho, if thou dost not know,that two things alone beyond all others are incentives to love, and these aregreat beauty and a good name, and these two things are to be found in Dulcineain the highest degree, for in beauty no one equals her and in good name fewapproach her; and to put the whole thing in a nutshell, I persuade myself thatall I say is as I say, neither more nor less, and I picture her in myimagination as I would have her to be, as well in beauty as in condition; Helenapproaches her not nor does Lucretia come up to her, nor any other of thefamous women of times past, Greek, Barbarian, or Latin; and let each say whathe will, for if in this I am taken to task by the ignorant, I shall not becensured by the critical.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I say that your worship is entirely right,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and that I aman ass. But I know not how the name of ass came into my mouth, for a ropeis not to be mentioned in the house of him who has been hanged; but nowfor the letter, and then, God be with you, I am off.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote took out the notebook, and, retiring to one side, verydeliberately began to write the letter, and when he had finished it hecalled to Sancho, saying he wished to read it to him, so that he mightcommit it to memory, in case of losing it on the road; for with evilfortune like his anything might be apprehended. To which Sancho replied,&ldquo;Write it two or three times there in the book and give it to me, and Iwill carry it very carefully, because to expect me to keep it in my memoryis all nonsense, for I have such a bad one that I often forget my ownname; but for all that repeat it to me, as I shall like to hear it, forsurely it will run as if it was in print.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;this is what it says:</p><p class="center"><i>&ldquo;Don Quixote&rsquo;s Letter to Dulcinea del Toboso</i></p><p class="letter">&ldquo;Sovereign and exalted Lady,&mdash;The pierced by the point of absence,the wounded to the heart&rsquo;s core, sends thee, sweetest Dulcinea delToboso, the health that he himself enjoys not. If thy beautydespises me, if thy worth is not for me, if thy scorn is myaffliction, though I be sufficiently long-suffering, hardly shall Iendure this anxiety, which, besides being oppressive, is protracted.My good squire Sancho will relate to thee in full, fair ingrate,dear enemy, the condition to which I am reduced on thy account: ifit be thy pleasure to give me relief, I am thine; if not, do as may bepleasing to thee; for by ending my life I shall satisfy thy crueltyand my desire.<br/>    &ldquo;Thine till death,<br/>    &ldquo;The Knight of the Rueful Countenance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By the life of my father,&rdquo; said Sancho, when he heard the letter, &ldquo;it isthe loftiest thing I ever heard.

I declare your worship is indeedthe very devil, and there is nothing you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything is needed for the calling I follow,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;let your worship put the order for the threeass-colts on the other side, and sign it very plainly, that they mayrecognise it at first sight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, and as he had written it he read itto this effect:</p><p class="letter">&ldquo;Mistress Niece,&mdash;By this first of ass-colts please pay to SanchoPanza, my squire, three of the five I left at home in your charge: saidthree ass-colts to be paid and delivered for the same number received herein hand, which upon this and upon his receipt shall be duly paid. Done inthe heart of the Sierra Morena, the twenty-seventh of August of thispresent year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;now let your worship sign it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no need to sign it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;but merely to put myflourish, which is the same as a signature, and enough for three asses, oreven three hundred.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can trust your worship,&rdquo; returned Sancho; &ldquo;let me go and saddleRocinante, and be ready to give me your blessing, for I mean to go at oncewithout seeing the fooleries your worship is going to do; I&rsquo;ll say I sawyou do so many that she will not want any more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At any rate, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;I should like&mdash;and there isreason for it&mdash;I should like thee, I say, to see me stripped to theskin and performing a dozen or two of insanities, which I can get done inless than half an hour; for having seen them with thine own eyes, thoucanst then safely swear to the rest that thou wouldst add; and I promisethee thou wilt not tell of as many as I mean to perform.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For the love of God, master mine,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;let me not see yourworship stripped, for it will sorely grieve me, and I shall not be able tokeep from tears, and my head aches so with all I shed last night forDapple, that I am not fit to begin any fresh weeping; but if it is yourworship&rsquo;s pleasure that I should see some insanities, do them in yourclothes, short ones, and such as come readiest to hand; for I myself wantnothing of the sort, and, as I have said, it will be a saving of time formy return, which will be with the news your worship desires and deserves.If not, let the lady Dulcinea look to it; if she does not answerreasonably, I swear as solemnly as I can that I will fetch a fair answerout of her stomach with kicks and cuffs; for why should it be borne that aknight-errant as famous as your worship should go mad without rhyme orreason for a&mdash;? Her ladyship had best not drive me to say it, for byGod I will speak out and let off everything cheap, even if it doesn&rsquo;tsell: I am pretty good at that! she little knows me; faith, if she knew meshe&rsquo;d be in awe of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In faith, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;to all appearance thou art nosounder in thy wits than I.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not so mad,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;but I am more peppery; but apart fromall this, what has your worship to eat until I come back? Will you sallyout on the road like Cardenio to force it from the shepherds?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let not that anxiety trouble thee,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;for even if Ihad it I should not eat anything but the herbs and the fruits which thismeadow and these trees may yield me; the beauty of this business of minelies in not eating, and in performing other mortifications.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know what I am afraid of?&rdquo; said Sancho upon this; &ldquo;that I shallnot be able to find my way back to this spot where I am leaving you, it issuch an out-of-the-way place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Observe the landmarks well,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for I will try not to gofar from this neighbourhood, and I will even take care to mount thehighest of these rocks to see if I can discover thee returning; however,not to miss me and lose thyself, the best plan will be to cut somebranches of the broom that is so abundant about here, and as thou goest tolay them at intervals until thou hast come out upon the plain; these willserve thee, after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinth of Theseus, asmarks and signs for finding me on thy return.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I will,&rdquo; said Sancho Panza, and having cut some, he asked his master&rsquo;sblessing, and not without many tears on both sides, took his leave of him,and mounting Rocinante, of whom Don Quixote charged him earnestly to haveas much care as of his own person, he set out for the plain, strewing atintervals the branches of broom as his master had recommended him; and sohe went his way, though Don Quixote still entreated him to see him do wereit only a couple of mad acts. He had not gone a hundred paces, however,when he returned and said:</p><p>&ldquo;I must say, señor, your worship said quite right, that in order to beable to swear without a weight on my conscience that I had seen you do madthings, it would be well for me to see if it were only one; though in yourworship&rsquo;s remaining here I have seen a very great one.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c25c" id="c25c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c25c.jpg (261K)" src="images/c25c.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c25c.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Did I not tell thee so?&rdquo; said Don Quixote. &ldquo;Wait, Sancho, and I will dothem in the saying of a credo,&rdquo; and pulling off his breeches in all hastehe stripped himself to his skin and his shirt, and then, without more ado,he cut a couple of gambados in the air, and a couple of somersaults, heelsover head, making such a display that, not to see it a second time, Sanchowheeled Rocinante round, and felt easy, and satisfied in his mind that hecould swear he had left his master mad; and so we will leave him to followhis road until his return, which was a quick one.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c25e" id="c25e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c25e.jpg (20K)" src="images/c25e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br/>IN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE REFINEMENTS WHEREWITH DON QUIXOTE PLAYED THEPART OF A LOVER IN THE SIERRA MORENA</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c26a" id="c26a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c26a.jpg (111K)" src="images/c26a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c26a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Returning to the proceedings of him of the Rueful Countenance when hefound himself alone, the history says that when Don Quixote had completedthe performance of the somersaults or capers, naked from the waist downand clothed from the waist up, and saw that Sancho had gone off withoutwaiting to see any more crazy feats, he climbed up to the top of a highrock, and there set himself to consider what he had several times beforeconsidered without ever coming to any conclusion on the point, namelywhether it would be better and more to his purpose to imitate theoutrageous madness of Roland, or the melancholy madness of Amadis; andcommuning with himself he said:</p><p>&ldquo;What wonder is it if Roland was so good a knight and so valiant aseveryone says he was, when, after all, he was enchanted, and nobody couldkill him save by thrusting a corking pin into the sole of his foot, and healways wore shoes with seven iron soles? Though cunning devices did notavail him against Bernardo del Carpio, who knew all about them, andstrangled him in his arms at Roncesvalles. But putting the question of hisvalour aside, let us come to his losing his wits, for certain it is thathe did lose them in consequence of the proofs he discovered at thefountain, and the intelligence the shepherd gave him of Angelica havingslept more than two siestas with Medoro, a little curly-headed Moor, andpage to Agramante. If he was persuaded that this was true, and that hislady had wronged him, it is no wonder that he should have gone mad; but I,how am I to imitate him in his madness, unless I can imitate him in thecause of it? For my Dulcinea, I will venture to swear, never saw a Moor inher life, as he is, in his proper costume, and she is this day as themother that bore her, and I should plainly be doing her a wrong if,fancying anything else, I were to go mad with the same kind of madness asRoland the Furious. On the other hand, I see that Amadis of Gaul, withoutlosing his senses and without doing anything mad, acquired as a lover asmuch fame as the most famous; for, according to his history, on findinghimself rejected by his lady Oriana, who had ordered him not to appear inher presence until it should be her pleasure, all he did was to retire tothe Peña Pobre in company with a hermit, and there he took his fill ofweeping until Heaven sent him relief in the midst of his great grief andneed. And if this be true, as it is, why should I now take the trouble tostrip stark naked, or do mischief to these trees which have done me noharm, or why am I to disturb the clear waters of these brooks which willgive me to drink whenever I have a mind? Long live the memory of Amadisand let him be imitated so far as is possible by Don Quixote of La Mancha,of whom it will be said, as was said of the other, that if he did notachieve great things, he died in attempting them; and if I am not repulsedor rejected by my Dulcinea, it is enough for me, as I have said, to beabsent from her. And so, now to business; come to my memory ye deeds ofAmadis, and show me how I am to begin to imitate you. I know already thatwhat he chiefly did was to pray and commend himself to God; but what am Ito do for a rosary, for I have not got one?&rdquo;</p><p>And then it occurred to him how he might make one, and that was by tearinga great strip off the tail of his shirt which hung down, and making elevenknots on it, one bigger than the rest, and this served him for a rosaryall the time he was there, during which he repeated countless ave-marias.But what distressed him greatly was not having another hermit there toconfess him and receive consolation from; and so he solaced himself withpacing up and down the little meadow, and writing and carving on the barkof the trees and on the fine sand a multitude of verses all in harmonywith his sadness, and some in praise of Dulcinea; but, when he was foundthere afterwards, the only ones completely legible that could bediscovered were those that follow here:</p><p class="poem">Ye on the mountainside that grow,<br/>Ye green things all, trees, shrubs, and bushes,<br/>Are ye aweary of the woe<br/>That this poor aching bosom crushes?<br/>If it disturb you, and I owe<br/>Some reparation, it may be a<br/>Defence for me to let you know<br/>Don Quixote&rsquo;s tears are on the flow,<br/>And all for distant Dulcinea<br/>Del Toboso.<br/><br/>The lealest lover time can show,<br/>Doomed for a lady-love to languish,<br/>Among these solitudes doth go,<br/>A prey to every kind of anguish.<br/>Why Love should like a spiteful foe<br/>Thus use him, he hath no idea,<br/>But hogsheads full&mdash;this doth he know&mdash;<br/>Don Quixote&rsquo;s tears are on the flow,<br/>And all for distant Dulcinea<br/>Del Toboso.<br/><br/>Adventure-seeking doth he go<br/>Up rugged heights, down rocky valleys,<br/>But hill or dale, or high or low,<br/>Mishap attendeth all his sallies:<br/>Love still pursues him to and fro,<br/>And plies his cruel scourge&mdash;ah me! a<br/>Relentless fate, an endless woe;<br/>Don Quixote&rsquo;s tears are on the flow,<br/>And all for distant Dulcinea<br/>Del Toboso.<br/></p><p>The addition of &ldquo;Del Toboso&rdquo; to Dulcinea&rsquo;s name gave rise to no littlelaughter among those who found the above lines, for they suspected DonQuixote must have fancied that unless he added &ldquo;del Toboso&rdquo; when heintroduced the name of Dulcinea the verse would be unintelligible; whichwas indeed the fact, as he himself afterwards admitted. He wrote manymore, but, as has been said, these three verses were all that could beplainly and perfectly deciphered. In this way, and in sighing and callingon the fauns and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs of the streams, andEcho, moist and mournful, to answer, console, and hear him, as well as inlooking for herbs to sustain him, he passed his time until Sancho&rsquo;sreturn; and had that been delayed three weeks, as it was three days, theKnight of the Rueful Countenance would have worn such an alteredcountenance that the mother that bore him would not have known him: andhere it will be well to leave him, wrapped up in sighs and verses, torelate how Sancho Panza fared on his mission.</p><p>As for him, coming out upon the high road, he made for El Toboso, and thenext day reached the inn where the mishap of the blanket had befallen him.As soon as he recognised it he felt as if he were once more living throughthe air, and he could not bring himself to enter it though it was an hourwhen he might well have done so, for it was dinner-time, and he longed totaste something hot as it had been all cold fare with him for many dayspast. This craving drove him to draw near to the inn, still undecidedwhether to go in or not, and as he was hesitating there came out twopersons who at once recognised him, and said one to the other:</p><p>&ldquo;Señor licentiate, is not he on the horse there Sancho Panza who, ouradventurer&rsquo;s housekeeper told us, went off with her master as esquire?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said the licentiate, &ldquo;and that is our friend Don Quixote&rsquo;shorse;&rdquo; and if they knew him so well it was because they were the curateand the barber of his own village, the same who had carried out thescrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they recognisedSancho Panza and Rocinante, being anxious to hear of Don Quixote, theyapproached, and calling him by his name the curate said, &ldquo;Friend SanchoPanza, where is your master?&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho recognised them at once, and determined to keep secret the placeand circumstances where and under which he had left his master, so hereplied that his master was engaged in a certain quarter on a certainmatter of great importance to him which he could not disclose for the eyesin his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t tell us where he is, SanchoPanza, we will suspect as we suspect already, that you have murdered androbbed him, for here you are mounted on his horse; in fact, you mustproduce the master of the hack, or else take the consequences.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no need of threats with me,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for I am not a man torob or murder anybody; let his own fate, or God who made him, kill eachone; my master is engaged very much to his taste doing penance in themidst of these mountains;&rdquo; and then, offhand and without stopping, he toldthem how he had left him, what adventures had befallen him, and how he wascarrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, the daughter of LorenzoCorchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears in love. They were bothamazed at what Sancho Panza told them; for though they were aware of DonQuixote&rsquo;s madness and the nature of it, each time they heard of it theywere filled with fresh wonder. They then asked Sancho Panza to show themthe letter he was carrying to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. He said it waswritten in a notebook, and that his master&rsquo;s directions were that heshould have it copied on paper at the first village he came to. On thisthe curate said if he showed it to him, he himself would make a fair copyof it. Sancho put his hand into his bosom in search of the notebook butcould not find it, nor, if he had been searching until now, could he havefound it, for Don Quixote had kept it, and had never given it to him, norhad he himself thought of asking for it. When Sancho discovered he couldnot find the book his face grew deadly pale, and in great haste he againfelt his body all over, and seeing plainly it was not to be found, withoutmore ado he seized his beard with both hands and plucked away half of it,and then, as quick as he could and without stopping, gave himself half adozen cuffs on the face and nose till they were bathed in blood.</p><p>Seeing this, the curate and the barber asked him what had happened himthat he gave himself such rough treatment.</p><p>&ldquo;What should happen to me?&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;but to have lost from one handto the other, in a moment, three ass-colts, each of them like a castle?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; said the barber.</p><p>&ldquo;I have lost the notebook,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that contained the letter toDulcinea, and an order signed by my master in which he directed his nieceto give me three ass-colts out of four or five he had at home;&rdquo; and hethen told them about the loss of Dapple.</p><p>The curate consoled him, telling him that when his master was found hewould get him to renew the order, and make a fresh draft on paper, as wasusual and customary; for those made in notebooks were never accepted orhonoured.</p><p>Sancho comforted himself with this, and said if that were so the loss ofDulcinea&rsquo;s letter did not trouble him much, for he had it almost by heart,and it could be taken down from him wherever and whenever they liked.</p><p>&ldquo;Repeat it then, Sancho,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;and we will write it downafterwards.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho Panza stopped to scratch his head to bring back the letter to hismemory, and balanced himself now on one foot, now the other, one momentstaring at the ground, the next at the sky, and after having half gnawedoff the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waiting for him tobegin, he said, after a long pause, &ldquo;By God, señor licentiate, devil athing can I recollect of the letter; but it said at the beginning,&lsquo;Exalted and scrubbing Lady.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It cannot have said &lsquo;scrubbing,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;but &lsquo;superhuman&rsquo; or&lsquo;sovereign.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is it,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;then, as well as I remember, it went on, &lsquo;Thewounded, and wanting of sleep, and the pierced, kisses your worship&rsquo;shands, ungrateful and very unrecognised fair one; and it said something orother about health and sickness that he was sending her; and from that itwent tailing off until it ended with &lsquo;Yours till death, the Knight of theRueful Countenance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>It gave them no little amusement, both of them, to see what a good memorySancho had, and they complimented him greatly upon it, and begged him torepeat the letter a couple of times more, so that they too might get it byheart to write it out by-and-by. Sancho repeated it three times, and as hedid, uttered three thousand more absurdities; then he told them more abouthis master but he never said a word about the blanketing that had befallenhimself in that inn, into which he refused to enter. He told them,moreover, how his lord, if he brought him a favourable answer from thelady Dulcinea del Toboso, was to put himself in the way of endeavouring tobecome an emperor, or at least a monarch; for it had been so settledbetween them, and with his personal worth and the might of his arm it wasan easy matter to come to be one: and how on becoming one his lord was tomake a marriage for him (for he would be a widower by that time, as amatter of course) and was to give him as a wife one of the damsels of theempress, the heiress of some rich and grand state on the mainland, havingnothing to do with islands of any sort, for he did not care for them now.All this Sancho delivered with so much composure&mdash;wiping his nosefrom time to time&mdash;and with so little common-sense that his twohearers were again filled with wonder at the force of Don Quixote&rsquo;smadness that could run away with this poor man&rsquo;s reason. They did not careto take the trouble of disabusing him of his error, as they consideredthat since it did not in any way hurt his conscience it would be better toleave him in it, and they would have all the more amusement in listeningto his simplicities; and so they bade him pray to God for his lord&rsquo;shealth, as it was a very likely and a very feasible thing for him incourse of time to come to be an emperor, as he said, or at least anarchbishop or some other dignitary of equal rank.</p><p>To which Sancho made answer, &ldquo;If fortune, sirs, should bring things aboutin such a way that my master should have a mind, instead of being anemperor, to be an archbishop, I should like to know whatarchbishops-errant commonly give their squires?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They commonly give them,&rdquo; said the curate, some simple benefice or cure,or some place as sacristan which brings them a good fixed income, notcounting the altar fees, which may be reckoned at as much more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But for that,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;the squire must be unmarried, and must know,at any rate, how to help at mass, and if that be so, woe is me, for I ammarried already and I don&rsquo;t know the first letter of the A B C. What willbecome of me if my master takes a fancy to be an archbishop and not anemperor, as is usual and customary with knights-errant?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be not uneasy, friend Sancho,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;for we will entreat yourmaster, and advise him, even urging it upon him as a case of conscience,to become an emperor and not an archbishop, because it will be easier forhim as he is more valiant than lettered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I have thought,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;though I can tell you he is fit foranything: what I mean to do for my part is to pray to our Lord to placehim where it may be best for him, and where he may be able to bestow mostfavours upon me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You speak like a man of sense,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;and you will be actinglike a good Christian; but what must now be done is to take steps to coaxyour master out of that useless penance you say he is performing; and wehad best turn into this inn to consider what plan to adopt, and also todine, for it is now time.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho said they might go in, but that he would wait there outside, andthat he would tell them afterwards the reason why he was unwilling, andwhy it did not suit him to enter it; but he begged them to bring him outsomething to eat, and to let it be hot, and also to bring barley forRocinante. They left him and went in, and presently the barber brought himout something to eat. By-and-by, after they had between them carefullythought over what they should do to carry out their object, the curate hitupon an idea very well adapted to humour Don Quixote, and effect theirpurpose; and his notion, which he explained to the barber, was that hehimself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel, while the othershould try as best he could to pass for a squire, and that they shouldthus proceed to where Don Quixote was, and he, pretending to be anaggrieved and distressed damsel, should ask a favour of him, which as avaliant knight-errant he could not refuse to grant; and the favour hemeant to ask him was that he should accompany her whither she wouldconduct him, in order to redress a wrong which a wicked knight had doneher, while at the same time she should entreat him not to require her toremove her mask, nor ask her any question touching her circumstances untilhe had righted her with the wicked knight. And he had no doubt that DonQuixote would comply with any request made in these terms, and that inthis way they might remove him and take him to his own village, where theywould endeavour to find out if his extraordinary madness admitted of anykind of remedy.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c26e" id="c26e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c26e.jpg (48K)" src="images/c26e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.<br/>OF HOW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER PROCEEDED WITH THEIR SCHEME; TOGETHERWITH OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF RECORD IN THIS GREAT HISTORY</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c27a" id="c27a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c27a.jpg (169K)" src="images/c27a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c27a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The curate&rsquo;s plan did not seem a bad one to the barber, but on thecontrary so good that they immediately set about putting it in execution.They begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady, leaving her in pledge anew cassock of the curate&rsquo;s; and the barber made a beard out of agrey-brown or red ox-tail in which the landlord used to stick his comb.The landlady asked them what they wanted these things for, and the curatetold her in a few words about the madness of Don Quixote, and how thisdisguise was intended to get him away from the mountain where he then was.The landlord and landlady immediately came to the conclusion that themadman was their guest, the balsam man and master of the blanketed squire,and they told the curate all that had passed between him and them, notomitting what Sancho had been so silent about. Finally the landladydressed up the curate in a style that left nothing to be desired; she puton him a cloth petticoat with black velvet stripes a palm broad, allslashed, and a bodice of green velvet set off by a binding of white satin,which as well as the petticoat must have been made in the time of kingWamba. The curate would not let them hood him, but put on his head alittle quilted linen cap which he used for a night-cap, and bound hisforehead with a strip of black silk, while with another he made a maskwith which he concealed his beard and face very well. He then put on hishat, which was broad enough to serve him for an umbrella, and envelopinghimself in his cloak seated himself woman-fashion on his mule, while thebarber mounted his with a beard down to the waist of mingled red andwhite, for it was, as has been said, the tail of a clay-red ox.</p><p>They took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as shewas, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant themsuccess in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had inhand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck thecurate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that fashion, asit was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself that way eventhough much might depend upon it; and saying so to the barber he beggedhim to change dresses, as it was fitter he should be the distresseddamsel, while he himself would play the squire&rsquo;s part, which would be lessderogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was resolved to have nothing moreto do with the matter, and let the devil take Don Quixote. Just at thismoment Sancho came up, and on seeing the pair in such a costume he wasunable to restrain his laughter; the barber, however, agreed to do as thecurate wished, and, altering their plan, the curate went on to instructhim how to play his part and what to say to Don Quixote to induce andcompel him to come with them and give up his fancy for the place he hadchosen for his idle penance. The barber told him he could manage itproperly without any instruction, and as he did not care to dress himselfup until they were near where Don Quixote was, he folded up the garments,and the curate adjusted his beard, and they set out under the guidance ofSancho Panza, who went along telling them of the encounter with the madmanthey met in the Sierra, saying nothing, however, about the finding of thevalise and its contents; for with all his simplicity the lad was a triflecovetous.</p><p>The next day they reached the place where Sancho had laid thebroom-branches as marks to direct him to where he had left his master, andrecognising it he told them that here was the entrance, and that theywould do well to dress themselves, if that was required to deliver hismaster; for they had already told him that going in this guise anddressing in this way were of the highest importance in order to rescue hismaster from the pernicious life he had adopted; and they charged himstrictly not to tell his master who they were, or that he knew them, andshould he ask, as ask he would, if he had given the letter to Dulcinea, tosay that he had, and that, as she did not know how to read, she had givenan answer by word of mouth, saying that she commanded him, on pain of herdispleasure, to come and see her at once; and it was a very importantmatter for himself, because in this way and with what they meant to say tohim they felt sure of bringing him back to a better mode of life andinducing him to take immediate steps to become an emperor or monarch, forthere was no fear of his becoming an archbishop. All this Sancho listenedto and fixed it well in his memory, and thanked them heartily forintending to recommend his master to be an emperor instead of anarchbishop, for he felt sure that in the way of bestowing rewards on theirsquires emperors could do more than archbishops-errant. He said, too, thatit would be as well for him to go on before them to find him, and give himhis lady&rsquo;s answer; for that perhaps might be enough to bring him away fromthe place without putting them to all this trouble. They approved of whatSancho proposed, and resolved to wait for him until he brought back wordof having found his master.</p><p>Sancho pushed on into the glens of the Sierra, leaving them in one throughwhich there flowed a little gentle rivulet, and where the rocks and treesafforded a cool and grateful shade. It was an August day with all the heatof one, and the heat in those parts is intense, and the hour was three inthe afternoon, all which made the spot the more inviting and tempted themto wait there for Sancho&rsquo;s return, which they did. They were reposing,then, in the shade, when a voice unaccompanied by the notes of anyinstrument, but sweet and pleasing in its tone, reached their ears, atwhich they were not a little astonished, as the place did not seem to themlikely quarters for one who sang so well; for though it is often said thatshepherds of rare voice are to be found in the woods and fields, this israther a flight of the poet&rsquo;s fancy than the truth. And still moresurprised were they when they perceived that what they heard sung were theverses not of rustic shepherds, but of the polished wits of the city; andso it proved, for the verses they heard were these:</p><p class="poem">What makes my quest of happiness seem vain?<br/>Disdain.<br/>What bids me to abandon hope of ease?<br/>Jealousies.<br/>What holds my heart in anguish of suspense?<br/>Absence.<br/>If that be so, then for my grief<br/>Where shall I turn to seek relief,<br/>When hope on every side lies slain<br/>By Absence, Jealousies, Disdain?<br/><br/>What the prime cause of all my woe doth prove?<br/>Love.<br/>What at my glory ever looks askance?<br/>Chance.<br/>Whence is permission to afflict me given?<br/>Heaven.<br/>If that be so, I but await<br/>The stroke of a resistless fate,<br/>Since, working for my woe, these three,<br/>Love, Chance and Heaven, in league I see.<br/><br/>What must I do to find a remedy?<br/>Die.<br/>What is the lure for love when coy and strange?<br/>Change.<br/>What, if all fail, will cure the heart of sadness?<br/>Madness.<br/>If that be so, it is but folly<br/>To seek a cure for melancholy:<br/>Ask where it lies; the answer saith<br/>In Change, in Madness, or in Death.<br/></p><p>The hour, the summer season, the solitary place, the voice and skill ofthe singer, all contributed to the wonder and delight of the twolisteners, who remained still waiting to hear something more; finding,however, that the silence continued some little time, they resolved to goin search of the musician who sang with so fine a voice; but just as theywere about to do so they were checked by the same voice, which once morefell upon their ears, singing this</p><p class="poem">SONNET<br/><br/>When heavenward, holy Friendship, thou didst go<br/>Soaring to seek thy home beyond the sky,<br/>And take thy seat among the saints on high,<br/>It was thy will to leave on earth below<br/>Thy semblance, and upon it to bestow<br/>Thy veil, wherewith at times hypocrisy,<br/>Parading in thy shape, deceives the eye,<br/>And makes its vileness bright as virtue show.<br/>Friendship, return to us, or force the cheat<br/>That wears it now, thy livery to restore,<br/>By aid whereof sincerity is slain.<br/>If thou wilt not unmask thy counterfeit,<br/>This earth will be the prey of strife once more,<br/>As when primæval discord held its reign.<br/></p><p>The song ended with a deep sigh, and again the listeners remained waitingattentively for the singer to resume; but perceiving that the music hadnow turned to sobs and heart-rending moans they determined to find out whothe unhappy being could be whose voice was as rare as his sighs werepiteous, and they had not proceeded far when on turning the corner of arock they discovered a man of the same aspect and appearance as Sancho haddescribed to them when he told them the story of Cardenio. He, showing noastonishment when he saw them, stood still with his head bent down uponhis breast like one in deep thought, without raising his eyes to look atthem after the first glance when they suddenly came upon him. The curate,who was aware of his misfortune and recognised him by the description,being a man of good address, approached him and in a few sensible wordsentreated and urged him to quit a life of such misery, lest he should endit there, which would be the greatest of all misfortunes. Cardenio wasthen in his right mind, free from any attack of that madness which sofrequently carried him away, and seeing them dressed in a fashion sounusual among the frequenters of those wilds, could not help showing somesurprise, especially when he heard them speak of his case as if it were awell-known matter (for the curate&rsquo;s words gave him to understand as much)so he replied to them thus:</p><p>&ldquo;I see plainly, sirs, whoever you may be, that Heaven, whose care it is tosuccour the good, and even the wicked very often, here, in this remotespot, cut off from human intercourse, sends me, though I deserve it not,those who seek to draw me away from this to some better retreat, showingme by many and forcible arguments how unreasonably I act in leading thelife I do; but as they know, that if I escape from this evil I shall fallinto another still greater, perhaps they will set me down as a weak-mindedman, or, what is worse, one devoid of reason; nor would it be any wonder,for I myself can perceive that the effect of the recollection of mymisfortunes is so great and works so powerfully to my ruin, that in spiteof myself I become at times like a stone, without feeling orconsciousness; and I come to feel the truth of it when they tell me andshow me proofs of the things I have done when the terrible fit overmastersme; and all I can do is bewail my lot in vain, and idly curse my destiny,and plead for my madness by telling how it was caused, to any that care tohear it; for no reasonable beings on learning the cause will wonder at theeffects; and if they cannot help me at least they will not blame me, andthe repugnance they feel at my wild ways will turn into pity for my woes.If it be, sirs, that you are here with the same design as others have comewith, before you proceed with your wise arguments, I entreat you to hearthe story of my countless misfortunes, for perhaps when you have heard ityou will spare yourselves the trouble you would take in offeringconsolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it.&rdquo;</p><p>As they, both of them, desired nothing more than to hear from his own lipsthe cause of his suffering, they entreated him to tell it, promising notto do anything for his relief or comfort that he did not wish; andthereupon the unhappy gentleman began his sad story in nearly the samewords and manner in which he had related it to Don Quixote and thegoatherd a few days before, when, through Master Elisabad, and DonQuixote&rsquo;s scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry, the tale wasleft unfinished, as this history has already recorded; but now fortunatelythe mad fit kept off, allowed him to tell it to the end; and so, coming tothe incident of the note which Don Fernando had found in the volume of&ldquo;Amadis of Gaul,&rdquo; Cardenio said that he remembered it perfectly and thatit was in these words:</p><p class="center">&ldquo;<i>Luscinda to Cardenio.</i></p><p class="letter">&ldquo;Every day I discover merits in you that oblige and compel me to hold youin higher estimation; so if you desire to relieve me of this obligation withoutcost to my honour, you may easily do so. I have a father who knows you andloves me dearly, who without putting any constraint on my inclination willgrant what will be reasonable for you to have, if it be that you value me asyou say and as I believe you do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By this letter I was induced, as I told you, to demand Luscinda for mywife, and it was through it that Luscinda came to be regarded by DonFernando as one of the most discreet and prudent women of the day, andthis letter it was that suggested his design of ruining me before minecould be carried into effect. I told Don Fernando that all Luscinda&rsquo;sfather was waiting for was that mine should ask her of him, which I didnot dare to suggest to him, fearing that he would not consent to do so;not because he did not know perfectly well the rank, goodness, virtue, andbeauty of Luscinda, and that she had qualities that would do honour to anyfamily in Spain, but because I was aware that he did not wish me to marryso soon, before seeing what the Duke Ricardo would do for me. In short, Itold him I did not venture to mention it to my father, as well on accountof that difficulty, as of many others that discouraged me though I knewnot well what they were, only that it seemed to me that what I desired wasnever to come to pass. To all this Don Fernando answered that he wouldtake it upon himself to speak to my father, and persuade him to speak toLuscinda&rsquo;s father. O, ambitious Marius! O, cruel Catiline! O, wickedSylla! O, perfidious Ganelon! O, treacherous Vellido! O, vindictiveJulian! O, covetous Judas! Traitor, cruel, vindictive, and perfidious,wherein had this poor wretch failed in his fidelity, who with suchfrankness showed thee the secrets and the joys of his heart? What offencedid I commit? What words did I utter, or what counsels did I give that hadnot the furtherance of thy honour and welfare for their aim? But, woe isme, wherefore do I complain? for sure it is that when misfortunes springfrom the stars, descending from on high they fall upon us with such furyand violence that no power on earth can check their course nor humandevice stay their coming. Who could have thought that Don Fernando, ahighborn gentleman, intelligent, bound to me by gratitude for my services,one that could win the object of his love wherever he might set hisaffections, could have become so obdurate, as they say, as to rob me of myone ewe lamb that was not even yet in my possession? But laying asidethese useless and unavailing reflections, let us take up the broken threadof my unhappy story.</p><p>&ldquo;To proceed, then: Don Fernando finding my presence an obstacle to theexecution of his treacherous and wicked design, resolved to send me to hiselder brother under the pretext of asking money from him to pay for sixhorses which, purposely, and with the sole object of sending me away thathe might the better carry out his infernal scheme, he had purchased thevery day he offered to speak to my father, and the price of which he nowdesired me to fetch. Could I have anticipated this treachery? Could I byany chance have suspected it? Nay; so far from that, I offered with thegreatest pleasure to go at once, in my satisfaction at the good bargainthat had been made. That night I spoke with Luscinda, and told her whathad been agreed upon with Don Fernando, and how I had strong hopes of ourfair and reasonable wishes being realised. She, as unsuspicious as I wasof the treachery of Don Fernando, bade me try to return speedily, as shebelieved the fulfilment of our desires would be delayed only so long as myfather put off speaking to hers. I know not why it was that on saying thisto me her eyes filled with tears, and there came a lump in her throat thatprevented her from uttering a word of many more that it seemed to me shewas striving to say to me. I was astonished at this unusual turn, which Inever before observed in her, for we always conversed, whenever goodfortune and my ingenuity gave us the chance, with the greatest gaiety andcheerfulness, mingling tears, sighs, jealousies, doubts, or fears with ourwords; it was all on my part a eulogy of my good fortune that Heavenshould have given her to me for my mistress; I glorified her beauty, Iextolled her worth and her understanding; and she paid me back by praisingin me what in her love for me she thought worthy of praise; and besides wehad a hundred thousand trifles and doings of our neighbours andacquaintances to talk about, and the utmost extent of my boldness was totake, almost by force, one of her fair white hands and carry it to mylips, as well as the closeness of the low grating that separated usallowed me. But the night before the unhappy day of my departure she wept,she moaned, she sighed, and she withdrew leaving me filled with perplexityand amazement, overwhelmed at the sight of such strange and affectingsigns of grief and sorrow in Luscinda; but not to dash my hopes I ascribedit all to the depth of her love for me and the pain that separation givesthose who love tenderly. At last I took my departure, sad and dejected, myheart filled with fancies and suspicions, but not knowing well what it wasI suspected or fancied; plain omens pointing to the sad event andmisfortune that was awaiting me.</p><p>&ldquo;I reached the place whither I had been sent, gave the letter to DonFernando&rsquo;s brother, and was kindly received but not promptly dismissed,for he desired me to wait, very much against my will, eight days in someplace where the duke his father was not likely to see me, as his brotherwrote that the money was to be sent without his knowledge; all of whichwas a scheme of the treacherous Don Fernando, for his brother had no wantof money to enable him to despatch me at once.</p><p>&ldquo;The command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeying it,as it seemed to me impossible to endure life for so many days separatedfrom Luscinda, especially after leaving her in the sorrowful mood I havedescribed to you; nevertheless as a dutiful servant I obeyed, though Ifelt it would be at the cost of my well-being. But four days later therecame a man in quest of me with a letter which he gave me, and which by theaddress I perceived to be from Luscinda, as the writing was hers. I openedit with fear and trepidation, persuaded that it must be something seriousthat had impelled her to write to me when at a distance, as she seldom didso when I was near. Before reading it I asked the man who it was that hadgiven it to him, and how long he had been upon the road; he told me thatas he happened to be passing through one of the streets of the city at thehour of noon, a very beautiful lady called to him from a window, and withtears in her eyes said to him hurriedly, &lsquo;Brother, if you are, as you seemto be, a Christian, for the love of God I entreat you to have this letterdespatched without a moment&rsquo;s delay to the place and person named in theaddress, all which is well known, and by this you will render a greatservice to our Lord; and that you may be at no inconvenience in doing sotake what is in this handkerchief;&rsquo; and said he, &lsquo;with this she threw me ahandkerchief out of the window in which were tied up a hundred reals andthis gold ring which I bring here together with the letter I have givenyou. And then without waiting for any answer she left the window, thoughnot before she saw me take the letter and the handkerchief, and I had bysigns let her know that I would do as she bade me; and so, seeing myselfso well paid for the trouble I would have in bringing it to you, andknowing by the address that it was to you it was sent (for, señor, I knowyou very well), and also unable to resist that beautiful lady&rsquo;s tears, Iresolved to trust no one else, but to come myself and give it to you, andin sixteen hours from the time when it was given me I have made thejourney, which, as you know, is eighteen leagues.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All the while the good-natured improvised courier was telling me this, Ihung upon his words, my legs trembling under me so that I could scarcelystand. However, I opened the letter and read these words:</p><p class="letter">The promise Don Fernando gave you to urge your father to speak to mine, he hasfulfilled much more to his own satisfaction than to your advantage. I have totell you, señor, that he has demanded me for a wife, and my father, led away bywhat he considers Don Fernando&rsquo;s superiority over you, has favoured hissuit so cordially, that in two days hence the betrothal is to take place withsuch secrecy and so privately that the only witnesses are to be the Heavensabove and a few of the household. Picture to yourself the state I am in; judgeif it be urgent for you to come; the issue of the affair will show you whetherI love you or not. God grant this may come to your hand before mine shall beforced to link itself with his who keeps so ill the faith that he has pledged.</p><p>&ldquo;Such, in brief, were the words of the letter, words that made me set outat once without waiting any longer for reply or money; for I now sawclearly that it was not the purchase of horses but of his own pleasurethat had made Don Fernando send me to his brother. The exasperation I feltagainst Don Fernando, joined with the fear of losing the prize I had wonby so many years of love and devotion, lent me wings; so that almostflying I reached home the same day, by the hour which served for speakingwith Luscinda. I arrived unobserved, and left the mule on which I had comeat the house of the worthy man who had brought me the letter, and fortunewas pleased to be for once so kind that I found Luscinda at the gratingthat was the witness of our loves. She recognised me at once, and I her,but not as she ought to have recognised me, or I her. But who is there inthe world that can boast of having fathomed or understood the waveringmind and unstable nature of a woman? Of a truth no one. To proceed: assoon as Luscinda saw me she said, &lsquo;Cardenio, I am in my bridal dress, andthe treacherous Don Fernando and my covetous father are waiting for me inthe hall with the other witnesses, who shall be the witnesses of my deathbefore they witness my betrothal. Be not distressed, my friend, butcontrive to be present at this sacrifice, and if that cannot be preventedby my words, I have a dagger concealed which will prevent more deliberateviolence, putting an end to my life and giving thee a first proof of thelove I have borne and bear thee.&rsquo; I replied to her distractedly andhastily, in fear lest I should not have time to reply, &lsquo;May thy words beverified by thy deeds, lady; and if thou hast a dagger to save thy honour,I have a sword to defend thee or kill myself if fortune be against us.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think she could not have heard all these words, for I perceived thatthey called her away in haste, as the bridegroom was waiting. Now thenight of my sorrow set in, the sun of my happiness went down, I felt myeyes bereft of sight, my mind of reason. I could not enter the house, norwas I capable of any movement; but reflecting how important it was that Ishould be present at what might take place on the occasion, I nervedmyself as best I could and went in, for I well knew all the entrances andoutlets; and besides, with the confusion that in secret pervaded the houseno one took notice of me, so, without being seen, I found an opportunityof placing myself in the recess formed by a window of the hall itself, andconcealed by the ends and borders of two tapestries, from between which Icould, without being seen, see all that took place in the room. Who coulddescribe the agitation of heart I suffered as I stood there&mdash;thethoughts that came to me&mdash;the reflections that passed through mymind? They were such as cannot be, nor were it well they should be, told.Suffice it to say that the bridegroom entered the hall in his usual dress,without ornament of any kind; as groomsman he had with him a cousin ofLuscinda&rsquo;s and except the servants of the house there was no one else inthe chamber. Soon afterwards Luscinda came out from an antechamber,attended by her mother and two of her damsels, arrayed and adorned asbecame her rank and beauty, and in full festival and ceremonial attire. Myanxiety and distraction did not allow me to observe or notice particularlywhat she wore; I could only perceive the colours, which were crimson andwhite, and the glitter of the gems and jewels on her head dress andapparel, surpassed by the rare beauty of her lovely auburn hair that vyingwith the precious stones and the light of the four torches that stood inthe hall shone with a brighter gleam than all. Oh memory, mortal foe of mypeace! why bring before me now the incomparable beauty of that adoredenemy of mine? Were it not better, cruel memory, to remind me and recallwhat she then did, that stirred by a wrong so glaring I may seek, if notvengeance now, at least to rid myself of life? Be not weary, sirs, oflistening to these digressions; my sorrow is not one of those that can orshould be told tersely and briefly, for to me each incident seems to callfor many words.&rdquo;</p><p>To this the curate replied that not only were they not weary of listeningto him, but that the details he mentioned interested them greatly, beingof a kind by no means to be omitted and deserving of the same attention asthe main story.</p><p>&ldquo;To proceed, then,&rdquo; continued Cardenio: &ldquo;all being assembled in the hall,the priest of the parish came in and as he took the pair by the hand toperform the requisite ceremony, at the words, &lsquo;Will you, Señora Luscinda,take Señor Don Fernando, here present, for your lawful husband, as theholy Mother Church ordains?&rsquo; I thrust my head and neck out from betweenthe tapestries, and with eager ears and throbbing heart set myself tolisten to Luscinda&rsquo;s answer, awaiting in her reply the sentence of deathor the grant of life. Oh, that I had but dared at that moment to rushforward crying aloud, &lsquo;Luscinda, Luscinda! have a care what thou dost;remember what thou owest me; bethink thee thou art mine and canst not beanother&rsquo;s; reflect that thy utterance of &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and the end of my life willcome at the same instant. O, treacherous Don Fernando! robber of my glory,death of my life! What seekest thou? Remember that thou canst not as aChristian attain the object of thy wishes, for Luscinda is my bride, and Iam her husband!&rsquo; Fool that I am! now that I am far away, and out ofdanger, I say I should have done what I did not do: now that I haveallowed my precious treasure to be robbed from me, I curse the robber, onwhom I might have taken vengeance had I as much heart for it as I have forbewailing my fate; in short, as I was then a coward and a fool, littlewonder is it if I am now dying shame-stricken, remorseful, and mad.</p><p>&ldquo;The priest stood waiting for the answer of Luscinda, who for a long timewithheld it; and just as I thought she was taking out the dagger to saveher honour, or struggling for words to make some declaration of the truthon my behalf, I heard her say in a faint and feeble voice, &lsquo;I will:&rsquo; DonFernando said the same, and giving her the ring they stood linked by aknot that could never be loosed. The bridegroom then approached to embracehis bride; and she, pressing her hand upon her heart, fell fainting in hermother&rsquo;s arms. It only remains now for me to tell you the state I was inwhen in that consent that I heard I saw all my hopes mocked, the words andpromises of Luscinda proved falsehoods, and the recovery of the prize Ihad that instant lost rendered impossible for ever. I stood stupefied,wholly abandoned, it seemed, by Heaven, declared the enemy of the earththat bore me, the air refusing me breath for my sighs, the water moisturefor my tears; it was only the fire that gathered strength so that my wholeframe glowed with rage and jealousy. They were all thrown into confusionby Luscinda&rsquo;s fainting, and as her mother was unlacing her to give her aira sealed paper was discovered in her bosom which Don Fernando seized atonce and began to read by the light of one of the torches. As soon as hehad read it he seated himself in a chair, leaning his cheek on his hand inthe attitude of one deep in thought, without taking any part in theefforts that were being made to recover his bride from her fainting fit.</p><p>&ldquo;Seeing all the household in confusion, I ventured to come out regardlesswhether I were seen or not, and determined, if I were, to do some frenzieddeed that would prove to all the world the righteous indignation of mybreast in the punishment of the treacherous Don Fernando, and even in thatof the fickle fainting traitress. But my fate, doubtless reserving me forgreater sorrows, if such there be, so ordered it that just then I hadenough and to spare of that reason which has since been wanting to me; andso, without seeking to take vengeance on my greatest enemies (which mighthave been easily taken, as all thought of me was so far from their minds),I resolved to take it upon myself, and on myself to inflict the pain theydeserved, perhaps with even greater severity than I should have dealt outto them had I then slain them; for sudden pain is soon over, but thatwhich is protracted by tortures is ever slaying without ending life. In aword, I quitted the house and reached that of the man with whom I had leftmy mule; I made him saddle it for me, mounted without bidding himfarewell, and rode out of the city, like another Lot, not daring to turnmy head to look back upon it; and when I found myself alone in the opencountry, screened by the darkness of the night, and tempted by thestillness to give vent to my grief without apprehension or fear of beingheard or seen, then I broke silence and lifted up my voice in maledictionsupon Luscinda and Don Fernando, as if I could thus avenge the wrong theyhad done me. I called her cruel, ungrateful, false, thankless, but aboveall covetous, since the wealth of my enemy had blinded the eyes of heraffection, and turned it from me to transfer it to one to whom fortune hadbeen more generous and liberal. And yet, in the midst of this outburst ofexecration and upbraiding, I found excuses for her, saying it was nowonder that a young girl in the seclusion of her parents&rsquo; house, trainedand schooled to obey them always, should have been ready to yield to theirwishes when they offered her for a husband a gentleman of suchdistinction, wealth, and noble birth, that if she had refused to accepthim she would have been thought out of her senses, or to have set heraffection elsewhere, a suspicion injurious to her fair name and fame. Butthen again, I said, had she declared I was her husband, they would haveseen that in choosing me she had not chosen so ill but that they mightexcuse her, for before Don Fernando had made his offer, they themselvescould not have desired, if their desires had been ruled by reason, a moreeligible husband for their daughter than I was; and she, before taking thelast fatal step of giving her hand, might easily have said that I hadalready given her mine, for I should have come forward to support anyassertion of hers to that effect. In short, I came to the conclusion thatfeeble love, little reflection, great ambition, and a craving for rank,had made her forget the words with which she had deceived me, encouragedand supported by my firm hopes and honourable passion.</p><p>&ldquo;Thus soliloquising and agitated, I journeyed onward for the remainder ofthe night, and by daybreak I reached one of the passes of these mountains,among which I wandered for three days more without taking any path orroad, until I came to some meadows lying on I know not which side of themountains, and there I inquired of some herdsmen in what direction themost rugged part of the range lay. They told me that it was in thisquarter, and I at once directed my course hither, intending to end my lifehere; but as I was making my way among these crags, my mule dropped deadthrough fatigue and hunger, or, as I think more likely, in order to havedone with such a worthless burden as it bore in me. I was left on foot,worn out, famishing, without anyone to help me or any thought of seekinghelp: and so thus I lay stretched on the ground, how long I know not,after which I rose up free from hunger, and found beside me somegoatherds, who no doubt were the persons who had relieved me in my need,for they told me how they had found me, and how I had been utteringravings that showed plainly I had lost my reason; and since then I amconscious that I am not always in full possession of it, but at times soderanged and crazed that I do a thousand mad things, tearing my clothes,crying aloud in these solitudes, cursing my fate, and idly calling on thedear name of her who is my enemy, and only seeking to end my life inlamentation; and when I recover my senses I find myself so exhausted andweary that I can scarcely move. Most commonly my dwelling is the hollow ofa cork tree large enough to shelter this miserable body; the herdsmen andgoatherds who frequent these mountains, moved by compassion, furnish mewith food, leaving it by the wayside or on the rocks, where they think Imay perhaps pass and find it; and so, even though I may be then out of mysenses, the wants of nature teach me what is required to sustain me, andmake me crave it and eager to take it. At other times, so they tell mewhen they find me in a rational mood, I sally out upon the road, andthough they would gladly give it me, I snatch food by force from theshepherds bringing it from the village to their huts. Thus do pass thewretched life that remains to me, until it be Heaven&rsquo;s will to bring it toa close, or so to order my memory that I no longer recollect the beautyand treachery of Luscinda, or the wrong done me by Don Fernando; for if itwill do this without depriving me of life, I will turn my thoughts intosome better channel; if not, I can only implore it to have full mercy onmy soul, for in myself I feel no power or strength to release my body fromthis strait in which I have of my own accord chosen to place it.</p><p>&ldquo;Such, sirs, is the dismal story of my misfortune: say if it be one thatcan be told with less emotion than you have seen in me; and do not troubleyourselves with urging or pressing upon me what reason suggests as likelyto serve for my relief, for it will avail me as much as the medicineprescribed by a wise physician avails the sick man who will not take it. Ihave no wish for health without Luscinda; and since it is her pleasure tobe another&rsquo;s, when she is or should be mine, let it be mine to be a preyto misery when I might have enjoyed happiness. She by her ficklenessstrove to make my ruin irretrievable; I will strive to gratify her wishesby seeking destruction; and it will show generations to come that I alonewas deprived of that of which all others in misfortune have asuperabundance, for to them the impossibility of being consoled is itselfa consolation, while to me it is the cause of greater sorrows andsufferings, for I think that even in death there will not be an end ofthem.&rdquo;</p><p>Here Cardenio brought to a close his long discourse and story, as full ofmisfortune as it was of love; but just as the curate was going to addresssome words of comfort to him, he was stopped by a voice that reached hisear, saying in melancholy tones what will be told in the Fourth Part ofthis narrative; for at this point the sage and sagacious historian, CidHamete Benengeli, brought the Third to a conclusion.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c27e" id="c27e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c27e.jpg (65K)" src="images/c27e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE AND DELIGHTFUL ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL THECURATE AND THE BARBER IN THE SAME SIERRA</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c28a" id="c28a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c28a.jpg (159K)" src="images/c28a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c28a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Happy and fortunate were the times when that most daring knight DonQuixote of La Mancha was sent into the world; for by reason of his havingformed a resolution so honourable as that of seeking to revive and restoreto the world the long-lost and almost defunct order of knight-errantry, wenow enjoy in this age of ours, so poor in light entertainment, not onlythe charm of his veracious history, but also of the tales and episodescontained in it which are, in a measure, no less pleasing, ingenious, andtruthful, than the history itself; which, resuming its thread, carded,spun, and wound, relates that just as the curate was going to offerconsolation to Cardenio, he was interrupted by a voice that fell upon hisear saying in plaintive tones:</p><p>&ldquo;O God! is it possible I have found a place that may serve as a secretgrave for the weary load of this body that I support so unwillingly? Ifthe solitude these mountains promise deceives me not, it is so; ah! woe isme! how much more grateful to my mind will be the society of these rocksand brakes that permit me to complain of my misfortune to Heaven, thanthat of any human being, for there is none on earth to look to for counselin doubt, comfort in sorrow, or relief in distress!&rdquo;</p><p>All this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him, and as itseemed to them to be uttered close by, as indeed it was, they got up tolook for the speaker, and before they had gone twenty paces theydiscovered behind a rock, seated at the foot of an ash tree, a youth inthe dress of a peasant, whose face they were unable at the moment to seeas he was leaning forward, bathing his feet in the brook that flowed past.They approached so silently that he did not perceive them, being fullyoccupied in bathing his feet, which were so fair that they looked like twopieces of shining crystal brought forth among the other stones of thebrook. The whiteness and beauty of these feet struck them with surprise,for they did not seem to have been made to crush clods or to follow theplough and the oxen as their owner&rsquo;s dress suggested; and so, finding theyhad not been noticed, the curate, who was in front, made a sign to theother two to conceal themselves behind some fragments of rock that laythere; which they did, observing closely what the youth was about. He hadon a loose double-skirted dark brown jacket bound tight to his body with awhite cloth; he wore besides breeches and gaiters of brown cloth, and onhis head a brown montera; and he had the gaiters turned up as far as themiddle of the leg, which verily seemed to be of pure alabaster.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c28b" id="c28b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c28b.jpg (339K)" src="images/c28b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c28b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>As soon as he had done bathing his beautiful feet, he wiped them with atowel he took from under the montera, on taking off which he raised hisface, and those who were watching him had an opportunity of seeing abeauty so exquisite that Cardenio said to the curate in a whisper:</p><p>&ldquo;As this is not Luscinda, it is no human creature but a divine being.&rdquo;</p><p>The youth then took off the montera, and shaking his head from side toside there broke loose and spread out a mass of hair that the beams of thesun might have envied; by this they knew that what had seemed a peasantwas a lovely woman, nay the most beautiful the eyes of two of them hadever beheld, or even Cardenio&rsquo;s if they had not seen and known Luscinda,for he afterwards declared that only the beauty of Luscinda could comparewith this. The long auburn tresses not only covered her shoulders, butsuch was their length and abundance, concealed her all round beneath theirmasses, so that except the feet nothing of her form was visible. She nowused her hands as a comb, and if her feet had seemed like bits of crystalin the water, her hands looked like pieces of driven snow among her locks;all which increased not only the admiration of the three beholders, buttheir anxiety to learn who she was. With this object they resolved to showthemselves, and at the stir they made in getting upon their feet the fairdamsel raised her head, and parting her hair from before her eyes withboth hands, she looked to see who had made the noise, and the instant sheperceived them she started to her feet, and without waiting to put on hershoes or gather up her hair, hastily snatched up a bundle as though ofclothes that she had beside her, and, scared and alarmed, endeavoured totake flight; but before she had gone six paces she fell to the ground, herdelicate feet being unable to bear the roughness of the stones; seeingwhich, the three hastened towards her, and the curate addressing her firstsaid:</p><p>&ldquo;Stay, señora, whoever you may be, for those whom you see here only desireto be of service to you; you have no need to attempt a flight so heedless,for neither can your feet bear it, nor we allow it.&rdquo;</p><p>Taken by surprise and bewildered, she made no reply to these words. They,however, came towards her, and the curate taking her hand went on to say:</p><p>&ldquo;What your dress would hide, señora, is made known to us by your hair; aclear proof that it can be no trifling cause that has disguised yourbeauty in a garb so unworthy of it, and sent it into solitudes like thesewhere we have had the good fortune to find you, if not to relieve yourdistress, at least to offer you comfort; for no distress, so long as lifelasts, can be so oppressive or reach such a height as to make the suffererrefuse to listen to comfort offered with good intention. And so, señora,or señor, or whatever you prefer to be, dismiss the fears that ourappearance has caused you and make us acquainted with your good or evilfortunes, for from all of us together, or from each one of us, you willreceive sympathy in your trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>While the curate was speaking, the disguised damsel stood as ifspell-bound, looking at them without opening her lips or uttering a word,just like a village rustic to whom something strange that he has neverseen before has been suddenly shown; but on the curate addressing somefurther words to the same effect to her, sighing deeply she broke silenceand said:</p><p>&ldquo;Since the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me, andthe escape of my dishevelled tresses will not allow my tongue to deal infalsehoods, it would be idle for me now to make any further pretence ofwhat, if you were to believe me, you would believe more out of courtesythan for any other reason. This being so, I say I thank you, sirs, for theoffer you have made me, which places me under the obligation of complyingwith the request you have made of me; though I fear the account I shallgive you of my misfortunes will excite in you as much concern ascompassion, for you will be unable to suggest anything to remedy them orany consolation to alleviate them. However, that my honour may not be lefta matter of doubt in your minds, now that you have discovered me to be awoman, and see that I am young, alone, and in this dress, things thattaken together or separately would be enough to destroy any good name, Ifeel bound to tell what I would willingly keep secret if I could.&rdquo;</p><p>All this she who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered without anyhesitation, with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that they were notless charmed by her intelligence than by her beauty, and as they againrepeated their offers and entreaties to her to fulfil her promise, shewithout further pressing, first modestly covering her feet and gatheringup her hair, seated herself on a stone with the three placed around her,and, after an effort to restrain some tears that came to her eyes, in aclear and steady voice began her story thus:</p><p>&ldquo;In this Andalusia there is a town from which a duke takes a title whichmakes him one of those that are called Grandees of Spain. This noblemanhas two sons, the elder heir to his dignity and apparently to his goodqualities; the younger heir to I know not what, unless it be the treacheryof Vellido and the falsehood of Ganelon. My parents are this lord&rsquo;svassals, lowly in origin, but so wealthy that if birth had conferred asmuch on them as fortune, they would have had nothing left to desire, norshould I have had reason to fear trouble like that in which I find myselfnow; for it may be that my ill fortune came of theirs in not having beennobly born. It is true they are not so low that they have any reason to beashamed of their condition, but neither are they so high as to remove frommy mind the impression that my mishap comes of their humble birth. Theyare, in short, peasants, plain homely people, without any taint ofdisreputable blood, and, as the saying is, old rusty Christians, but sorich that by their wealth and free-handed way of life they are coming bydegrees to be considered gentlefolk by birth, and even by position; thoughthe wealth and nobility they thought most of was having me for theirdaughter; and as they have no other child to make their heir, and areaffectionate parents, I was one of the most indulged daughters that everparents indulged.</p><p>&ldquo;I was the mirror in which they beheld themselves, the staff of their oldage, and the object in which, with submission to Heaven, all their wishescentred, and mine were in accordance with theirs, for I knew their worth;and as I was mistress of their hearts, so was I also of their possessions.Through me they engaged or dismissed their servants; through my handspassed the accounts and returns of what was sown and reaped; theoil-mills, the wine-presses, the count of the flocks and herds, thebeehives, all in short that a rich farmer like my father has or can have,I had under my care, and I acted as steward and mistress with an assiduityon my part and satisfaction on theirs that I cannot well describe to you.The leisure hours left to me after I had given the requisite orders to thehead-shepherds, overseers, and other labourers, I passed in suchemployments as are not only allowable but necessary for young girls, thosethat the needle, embroidery cushion, and spinning wheel usually afford,and if to refresh my mind I quitted them for a while, I found recreationin reading some devotional book or playing the harp, for experience taughtme that music soothes the troubled mind and relieves weariness of spirit.Such was the life I led in my parents&rsquo; house and if I have depicted itthus minutely, it is not out of ostentation, or to let you know that I amrich, but that you may see how, without any fault of mine, I have fallenfrom the happy condition I have described, to the misery I am in atpresent. The truth is, that while I was leading this busy life, in aretirement that might compare with that of a monastery, and unseen as Ithought by any except the servants of the house (for when I went to Massit was so early in the morning, and I was so closely attended by my motherand the women of the household, and so thickly veiled and so shy, that myeyes scarcely saw more ground than I trod on), in spite of all this, theeyes of love, or idleness, more properly speaking, that the lynx&rsquo;s cannotrival, discovered me, with the help of the assiduity of Don Fernando; forthat is the name of the younger son of the duke I told of.&rdquo;</p><p>The moment the speaker mentioned the name of Don Fernando, Cardeniochanged colour and broke into a sweat, with such signs of emotion that thecurate and the barber, who observed it, feared that one of the mad fitswhich they heard attacked him sometimes was coming upon him; but Cardenioshowed no further agitation and remained quiet, regarding the peasant girlwith fixed attention, for he began to suspect who she was. She, however,without noticing the excitement of Cardenio, continuing her story, went onto say:</p><p>&ldquo;And they had hardly discovered me, when, as he owned afterwards, he wassmitten with a violent love for me, as the manner in which it displayeditself plainly showed. But to shorten the long recital of my woes, I willpass over in silence all the artifices employed by Don Fernando fordeclaring his passion for me. He bribed all the household, he gave andoffered gifts and presents to my parents; every day was like a holiday ora merry-making in our street; by night no one could sleep for the music;the love letters that used to come to my hand, no one knew how, wereinnumerable, full of tender pleadings and pledges, containing morepromises and oaths than there were letters in them; all which not only didnot soften me, but hardened my heart against him, as if he had been mymortal enemy, and as if everything he did to make me yield were done withthe opposite intention. Not that the high-bred bearing of Don Fernando wasdisagreeable to me, or that I found his importunities wearisome; for itgave me a certain sort of satisfaction to find myself so sought and prizedby a gentleman of such distinction, and I was not displeased at seeing mypraises in his letters (for however ugly we women may be, it seems to meit always pleases us to hear ourselves called beautiful) but that my ownsense of right was opposed to all this, as well as the repeated advice ofmy parents, who now very plainly perceived Don Fernando&rsquo;s purpose, for hecared very little if all the world knew it. They told me they trusted andconfided their honour and good name to my virtue and rectitude alone, andbade me consider the disparity between Don Fernando and myself, from whichI might conclude that his intentions, whatever he might say to thecontrary, had for their aim his own pleasure rather than my advantage; andif I were at all desirous of opposing an obstacle to his unreasonablesuit, they were ready, they said, to marry me at once to anyone Ipreferred, either among the leading people of our own town, or of any ofthose in the neighbourhood; for with their wealth and my good name, amatch might be looked for in any quarter. This offer, and their soundadvice strengthened my resolution, and I never gave Don Fernando a word inreply that could hold out to him any hope of success, however remote.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c28c" id="c28c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c28c.jpg (279K)" src="images/c28c.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c28c.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;All this caution of mine, which he must have taken for coyness, hadapparently the effect of increasing his wanton appetite&mdash;for that isthe name I give to his passion for me; had it been what he declared it tobe, you would not know of it now, because there would have been nooccasion to tell you of it. At length he learned that my parents werecontemplating marriage for me in order to put an end to his hopes ofobtaining possession of me, or at least to secure additional protectors towatch over me, and this intelligence or suspicion made him act as youshall hear. One night, as I was in my chamber with no other companion thana damsel who waited on me, with the doors carefully locked lest my honourshould be imperilled through any carelessness, I know not nor can conceivehow it happened, but, with all this seclusion and these precautions, andin the solitude and silence of my retirement, I found him standing beforeme, a vision that so astounded me that it deprived my eyes of sight, andmy tongue of speech. I had no power to utter a cry, nor, I think, did hegive me time to utter one, as he immediately approached me, and taking mein his arms (for, overwhelmed as I was, I was powerless, I say, to helpmyself), he began to make such professions to me that I know not howfalsehood could have had the power of dressing them up to seem so liketruth; and the traitor contrived that his tears should vouch for hiswords, and his sighs for his sincerity.</p><p>&ldquo;I, a poor young creature alone, ill versed among my people in cases suchas this, began, I know not how, to think all these lying protestationstrue, though without being moved by his sighs and tears to anything morethan pure compassion; and so, as the first feeling of bewilderment passedaway, and I began in some degree to recover myself, I said to him withmore courage than I thought I could have possessed, &lsquo;If, as I am now inyour arms, señor, I were in the claws of a fierce lion, and my deliverancecould be procured by doing or saying anything to the prejudice of myhonour, it would no more be in my power to do it or say it, than it wouldbe possible that what was should not have been; so then, if you hold mybody clasped in your arms, I hold my soul secured by virtuous intentions,very different from yours, as you will see if you attempt to carry theminto effect by force. I am your vassal, but I am not your slave; yournobility neither has nor should have any right to dishonour or degrade myhumble birth; and low-born peasant as I am, I have my self-respect as muchas you, a lord and gentleman: with me your violence will be to no purpose,your wealth will have no weight, your words will have no power to deceiveme, nor your sighs or tears to soften me: were I to see any of the thingsI speak of in him whom my parents gave me as a husband, his will should bemine, and mine should be bounded by his; and my honour being preservedeven though my inclinations were not would willingly yield him what you,señor, would now obtain by force; and this I say lest you should supposethat any but my lawful husband shall ever win anything of me.&rsquo; &lsquo;If that,&rsquo;said this disloyal gentleman, &lsquo;be the only scruple you feel, fairestDorothea&rsquo; (for that is the name of this unhappy being), &lsquo;see here I giveyou my hand to be yours, and let Heaven, from which nothing is hid, andthis image of Our Lady you have here, be witnesses of this pledge.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c28d" id="c28d"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c28d.jpg (289K)" src="images/c28d.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c28d.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>When Cardenio heard her say she was called Dorothea, he showed freshagitation and felt convinced of the truth of his former suspicion, but hewas unwilling to interrupt the story, and wished to hear the end of whathe already all but knew, so he merely said:</p><p>&ldquo;What! is Dorothea your name, señora? I have heard of another of the samename who can perhaps match your misfortunes. But proceed; by-and-by I maytell you something that will astonish you as much as it will excite yourcompassion.&rdquo;</p><p>Dorothea was struck by Cardenio&rsquo;s words as well as by his strange andmiserable attire, and begged him if he knew anything concerning her totell it to her at once, for if fortune had left her any blessing it wascourage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her, as she felt surethat none could reach her capable of increasing in any degree what sheendured already.</p><p>&ldquo;I would not let the occasion pass, señora,&rdquo; replied Cardenio, &ldquo;of tellingyou what I think, if what I suspect were the truth, but so far there hasbeen no opportunity, nor is it of any importance to you to know it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be it as it may,&rdquo; replied Dorothea, &ldquo;what happened in my story was thatDon Fernando, taking an image that stood in the chamber, placed it as awitness of our betrothal, and with the most binding words and extravagantoaths gave me his promise to become my husband; though before he had madean end of pledging himself I bade him consider well what he was doing, andthink of the anger his father would feel at seeing him married to apeasant girl and one of his vassals; I told him not to let my beauty, suchas it was, blind him, for that was not enough to furnish an excuse for histransgression; and if in the love he bore me he wished to do me anykindness, it would be to leave my lot to follow its course at the level mycondition required; for marriages so unequal never brought happiness, nordid they continue long to afford the enjoyment they began with.</p><p>&ldquo;All this that I have now repeated I said to him, and much more which Icannot recollect; but it had no effect in inducing him to forego hispurpose; he who has no intention of paying does not trouble himself aboutdifficulties when he is striking the bargain. At the same time I arguedthe matter briefly in my own mind, saying to myself, &lsquo;I shall not be thefirst who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty station, norwill Don Fernando be the first whom beauty or, as is more likely, a blindattachment, has led to mate himself below his rank. Then, since I amintroducing no new usage or practice, I may as well avail myself of thehonour that chance offers me, for even though his inclination for meshould not outlast the attainment of his wishes, I shall be, after all,his wife before God. And if I strive to repel him by scorn, I can seethat, fair means failing, he is in a mood to use force, and I shall beleft dishonoured and without any means of proving my innocence to thosewho cannot know how innocently I have come to be in this position; forwhat arguments would persuade my parents that this gentleman entered mychamber without my consent?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All these questions and answers passed through my mind in a moment; butthe oaths of Don Fernando, the witnesses he appealed to, the tears heshed, and lastly the charms of his person and his high-bred grace, which,accompanied by such signs of genuine love, might well have conquered aheart even more free and coy than mine&mdash;these were the things thatmore than all began to influence me and lead me unawares to my ruin. Icalled my waiting-maid to me, that there might be a witness on earthbesides those in Heaven, and again Don Fernando renewed and repeated hisoaths, invoked as witnesses fresh saints in addition to the former ones,called down upon himself a thousand curses hereafter should he fail tokeep his promise, shed more tears, redoubled his sighs and pressed mecloser in his arms, from which he had never allowed me to escape; and so Iwas left by my maid, and ceased to be one, and he became a traitor and aperjured man.</p><p>&ldquo;The day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come soquickly, I imagine, as Don Fernando wished, for when desire has attainedits object, the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene of pleasure. Isay so because Don Fernando made all haste to leave me, and by theadroitness of my maid, who was indeed the one who had admitted him, gainedthe street before daybreak; but on taking leave of me he told me, thoughnot with as much earnestness and fervour as when he came, that I mightrest assured of his faith and of the sanctity and sincerity of his oaths;and to confirm his words he drew a rich ring off his finger and placed itupon mine. He then took his departure and I was left, I know not whethersorrowful or happy; all I can say is, I was left agitated and troubled inmind and almost bewildered by what had taken place, and I had not thespirit, or else it did not occur to me, to chide my maid for the treacheryshe had been guilty of in concealing Don Fernando in my chamber; for asyet I was unable to make up my mind whether what had befallen me was forgood or evil. I told Don Fernando at parting, that as I was now his, hemight see me on other nights in the same way, until it should be hispleasure to let the matter become known; but, except the following night,he came no more, nor for more than a month could I catch a glimpse of himin the street or in church, while I wearied myself with watching for one;although I knew he was in the town, and almost every day went out hunting,a pastime he was very fond of. I remember well how sad and dreary thosedays and hours were to me; I remember well how I began to doubt as theywent by, and even to lose confidence in the faith of Don Fernando; and Iremember, too, how my maid heard those words in reproof of her audacitythat she had not heard before, and how I was forced to put a constraint onmy tears and on the expression of my countenance, not to give my parentscause to ask me why I was so melancholy, and drive me to invent falsehoodsin reply. But all this was suddenly brought to an end, for the time camewhen all such considerations were disregarded, and there was no furtherquestion of honour, when my patience gave way and the secret of my heartbecame known abroad. The reason was, that a few days later it was reportedin the town that Don Fernando had been married in a neighbouring city to amaiden of rare beauty, the daughter of parents of distinguished position,though not so rich that her portion would entitle her to look for sobrilliant a match; it was said, too, that her name was Luscinda, and thatat the betrothal some strange things had happened.&rdquo;</p><p>Cardenio heard the name of Luscinda, but he only shrugged his shoulders,bit his lips, bent his brows, and before long two streams of tears escapedfrom his eyes. Dorothea, however, did not interrupt her story, but went onin these words:</p><p>&ldquo;This sad intelligence reached my ears, and, instead of being struck witha chill, with such wrath and fury did my heart burn that I scarcelyrestrained myself from rushing out into the streets, crying aloud andproclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which I was the victim;but this transport of rage was for the time checked by a resolution Iformed, to be carried out the same night, and that was to assume thisdress, which I got from a servant of my father&rsquo;s, one of the zagals, asthey are called in farmhouses, to whom I confided the whole of mymisfortune, and whom I entreated to accompany me to the city where I heardmy enemy was. He, though he remonstrated with me for my boldness, andcondemned my resolution, when he saw me bent upon my purpose, offered tobear me company, as he said, to the end of the world. I at once packed upin a linen pillow-case a woman&rsquo;s dress, and some jewels and money toprovide for emergencies, and in the silence of the night, without lettingmy treacherous maid know, I sallied forth from the house, accompanied bymy servant and abundant anxieties, and on foot set out for the city, butborne as it were on wings by my eagerness to reach it, if not to preventwhat I presumed to be already done, at least to call upon Don Fernando totell me with what conscience he had done it. I reached my destination intwo days and a half, and on entering the city inquired for the house ofLuscinda&rsquo;s parents. The first person I asked gave me more in reply than Isought to know; he showed me the house, and told me all that had occurredat the betrothal of the daughter of the family, an affair of suchnotoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers in thestreet. He said that on the night of Don Fernando&rsquo;s betrothal withLuscinda, as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;she was taken with a sudden fainting fit, and that on the bridegroomapproaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air, he found apaper in her own handwriting, in which she said and declared that shecould not be Don Fernando&rsquo;s bride, because she was already Cardenio&rsquo;s,who, according to the man&rsquo;s account, was a gentleman of distinction of thesame city; and that if she had accepted Don Fernando, it was only inobedience to her parents. In short, he said, the words of the paper madeit clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of the betrothal, andgave her reasons for putting an end to herself all which was confirmed, itwas said, by a dagger they found somewhere in her clothes. On seeing this,Don Fernando, persuaded that Luscinda had befooled, slighted, and trifledwith him, assailed her before she had recovered from her swoon, and triedto stab her with the dagger that had been found, and would have succeededhad not her parents and those who were present prevented him. It was said,moreover, that Don Fernando went away at once, and that Luscinda did notrecover from her prostration until the next day, when she told her parentshow she was really the bride of that Cardenio I have mentioned. I learnedbesides that Cardenio, according to report, had been present at thebetrothal; and that upon seeing her betrothed contrary to his expectation,he had quitted the city in despair, leaving behind him a letter declaringthe wrong Luscinda had done him, and his intention of going where no oneshould ever see him again. All this was a matter of notoriety in the city,and everyone spoke of it; especially when it became known that Luscindawas missing from her father&rsquo;s house and from the city, for she was not tobe found anywhere, to the distraction of her parents, who knew not whatsteps to take to recover her. What I learned revived my hopes, and I wasbetter pleased not to have found Don Fernando than to find him married,for it seemed to me that the door was not yet entirely shut upon relief inmy case, and I thought that perhaps Heaven had put this impediment in theway of the second marriage, to lead him to recognise his obligations underthe former one, and reflect that as a Christian he was bound to considerhis soul above all human objects. All this passed through my mind, and Istrove to comfort myself without comfort, indulging in faint and distanthopes of cherishing that life that I now abhor.</p><p>&ldquo;But while I was in the city, uncertain what to do, as I could not findDon Fernando, I heard notice given by the public crier offering a greatreward to anyone who should find me, and giving the particulars of my ageand of the very dress I wore; and I heard it said that the lad who camewith me had taken me away from my father&rsquo;s house; a thing that cut me tothe heart, showing how low my good name had fallen, since it was notenough that I should lose it by my flight, but they must add with whom Ihad fled, and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of myconsideration. The instant I heard the notice I quitted the city with myservant, who now began to show signs of wavering in his fidelity to me,and the same night, for fear of discovery, we entered the most thicklywooded part of these mountains. But, as is commonly said, one evil callsup another and the end of one misfortune is apt to be the beginning of onestill greater, and so it proved in my case; for my worthy servant, untilthen so faithful and trusty when he found me in this lonely spot, movedmore by his own villainy than by my beauty, sought to take advantage ofthe opportunity which these solitudes seemed to present him, and withlittle shame and less fear of God and respect for me, began to makeovertures to me; and finding that I replied to the effrontery of hisproposals with justly severe language, he laid aside the entreaties whichhe had employed at first, and began to use violence.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c28e" id="c28e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c28e.jpg (324K)" src="images/c28e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c28e.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;But just Heaven, that seldom fails to watch over and aid good intentions,so aided mine that with my slight strength and with little exertion Ipushed him over a precipice, where I left him, whether dead or alive Iknow not; and then, with greater speed than seemed possible in my terrorand fatigue, I made my way into the mountains, without any other thoughtor purpose save that of hiding myself among them, and escaping my fatherand those despatched in search of me by his orders. It is now I know nothow many months since with this object I came here, where I met a herdsmanwho engaged me as his servant at a place in the heart of this Sierra, andall this time I have been serving him as herd, striving to keep alwaysafield to hide these locks which have now unexpectedly betrayed me. Butall my care and pains were unavailing, for my master made the discoverythat I was not a man, and harboured the same base designs as my servant;and as fortune does not always supply a remedy in cases of difficulty, andI had no precipice or ravine at hand down which to fling the master andcure his passion, as I had in the servant&rsquo;s case, I thought it a lesserevil to leave him and again conceal myself among these crags, than maketrial of my strength and argument with him. So, as I say, once more I wentinto hiding to seek for some place where I might with sighs and tearsimplore Heaven to have pity on my misery, and grant me help and strengthto escape from it, or let me die among the solitudes, leaving no trace ofan unhappy being who, by no fault of hers, has furnished matter for talkand scandal at home and abroad.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c28f" id="c28f"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c28f.jpg (42K)" src="images/c28f.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF THE DROLL DEVICE AND METHOD ADOPTED TO EXTRICATE OURLOVE-STRICKEN KNIGHT FROM THE SEVERE PENANCE HE HAD IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c29a" id="c29a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c29a.jpg (99K)" src="images/c29a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c29a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Such, sirs, is the true story of my sad adventures; judge for yourselvesnow whether the sighs and lamentations you heard, and the tears thatflowed from my eyes, had not sufficient cause even if I had indulged inthem more freely; and if you consider the nature of my misfortune you willsee that consolation is idle, as there is no possible remedy for it. All Iask of you is, what you may easily and reasonably do, to show me where Imay pass my life unharassed by the fear and dread of discovery by thosewho are in search of me; for though the great love my parents bear memakes me feel sure of being kindly received by them, so great is myfeeling of shame at the mere thought that I cannot present myself beforethem as they expect, that I had rather banish myself from their sight forever than look them in the face with the reflection that they beheld minestripped of that purity they had a right to expect in me.&rdquo;</p><p>With these words she became silent, and the colour that overspread herface showed plainly the pain and shame she was suffering at heart. Intheirs the listeners felt as much pity as wonder at her misfortunes; butas the curate was just about to offer her some consolation and adviceCardenio forestalled him, saying, &ldquo;So then, señora, you are the fairDorothea, the only daughter of the rich Clenardo?&rdquo; Dorothea was astonishedat hearing her father&rsquo;s name, and at the miserable appearance of him whomentioned it, for it has been already said how wretchedly clad Cardeniowas; so she said to him:</p><p>&ldquo;And who may you be, brother, who seem to know my father&rsquo;s name so well?For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not mentioned it in the wholestory of my misfortunes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am that unhappy being, señora,&rdquo; replied Cardenio, &ldquo;whom, as you havesaid, Luscinda declared to be her husband; I am the unfortunate Cardenio,whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your present conditionhas reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged, bereft of all humancomfort, and what is worse, of reason, for I only possess it when Heavenis pleased for some short space to restore it to me. I, Dorothea, am hewho witnessed the wrong done by Don Fernando, and waited to hear the &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;uttered by which Luscinda owned herself his betrothed: I am he who had notcourage enough to see how her fainting fit ended, or what came of thepaper that was found in her bosom, because my heart had not the fortitudeto endure so many strokes of ill-fortune at once; and so losing patience Iquitted the house, and leaving a letter with my host, which I entreatedhim to place in Luscinda&rsquo;s hands, I betook myself to these solitudes,resolved to end here the life I hated as if it were my mortal enemy. Butfate would not rid me of it, contenting itself with robbing me of myreason, perhaps to preserve me for the good fortune I have had in meetingyou; for if that which you have just told us be true, as I believe it tobe, it may be that Heaven has yet in store for both of us a happiertermination to our misfortunes than we look for; because seeing thatLuscinda cannot marry Don Fernando, being mine, as she has herself soopenly declared, and that Don Fernando cannot marry her as he is yours, wemay reasonably hope that Heaven will restore to us what is ours, as it isstill in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed. And as we have thisconsolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, I entreatyou, señora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as I mean to doin mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happier fortunes; for Iswear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a Christian not to desert youuntil I see you in possession of Don Fernando, and if I cannot by wordsinduce him to recognise his obligation to you, in that case to availmyself of the right which my rank as a gentleman gives me, and with justcause challenge him on account of the injury he has done you, notregarding my own wrongs, which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while Ion earth devote myself to yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Cardenio&rsquo;s words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, and not knowinghow to return thanks for such an offer, she attempted to kiss his feet;but Cardenio would not permit it, and the licentiate replied for both,commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly, begged, advised,and urged them to come with him to his village, where they might furnishthemselves with what they needed, and take measures to discover DonFernando, or restore Dorothea to her parents, or do what seemed to themmost advisable. Cardenio and Dorothea thanked him, and accepted the kindoffer he made them; and the barber, who had been listening to allattentively and in silence, on his part some kindly words also, and withno less good-will than the curate offered his services in any way thatmight be of use to them. He also explained to them in a few words theobject that had brought them there, and the strange nature of DonQuixote&rsquo;s madness, and how they were waiting for his squire, who had gonein search of him. Like the recollection of a dream, the quarrel he had hadwith Don Quixote came back to Cardenio&rsquo;s memory, and he described it tothe others; but he was unable to say what the dispute was about.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c29b" id="c29b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c29b.jpg (351K)" src="images/c29b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c29b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>At this moment they heard a shout, and recognised it as coming from SanchoPanza, who, not finding them where he had left them, was calling aloud tothem. They went to meet him, and in answer to their inquiries about DonQuixote, he told them how he had found him stripped to his shirt, lank,yellow, half dead with hunger, and sighing for his lady Dulcinea; andalthough he had told him that she commanded him to quit that place andcome to El Toboso, where she was expecting him, he had answered that hewas determined not to appear in the presence of her beauty until he haddone deeds to make him worthy of her favour; and if this went on, Sanchosaid, he ran the risk of not becoming an emperor as in duty bound, or evenan archbishop, which was the least he could be; for which reason theyought to consider what was to be done to get him away from there. Thelicentiate in reply told him not to be uneasy, for they would fetch himaway in spite of himself. He then told Cardenio and Dorothea what they hadproposed to do to cure Don Quixote, or at any rate take him home; uponwhich Dorothea said that she could play the distressed damsel better thanthe barber; especially as she had there the dress in which to do it to thelife, and that they might trust to her acting the part in every particularrequisite for carrying out their scheme, for she had read a great manybooks of chivalry, and knew exactly the style in which afflicted damselsbegged boons of knights-errant.</p><p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;there is nothing more required than toset about it at once, for beyond a doubt fortune is declaring itself inour favour, since it has so unexpectedly begun to open a door for yourrelief, and smoothed the way for us to our object.&rdquo;</p><p>Dorothea then took out of her pillow-case a complete petticoat of somerich stuff, and a green mantle of some other fine material, and a necklaceand other ornaments out of a little box, and with these in an instant sheso arrayed herself that she looked like a great and rich lady. All this,and more, she said, she had taken from home in case of need, but thatuntil then she had had no occasion to make use of it. They were all highlydelighted with her grace, air, and beauty, and declared Don Fernando to bea man of very little taste when he rejected such charms. But the one whoadmired her most was Sancho Panza, for it seemed to him (what indeed wastrue) that in all the days of his life he had never seen such a lovelycreature; and he asked the curate with great eagerness who this beautifullady was, and what she wanted in these out-of-the-way quarters.</p><p>&ldquo;This fair lady, brother Sancho,&rdquo; replied the curate, &ldquo;is no less apersonage than the heiress in the direct male line of the great kingdom ofMicomicon, who has come in search of your master to beg a boon of him,which is that he redress a wrong or injury that a wicked giant has doneher; and from the fame as a good knight which your master has acquired farand wide, this princess has come from Guinea to seek him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A lucky seeking and a lucky finding!&rdquo; said Sancho Panza at this;&ldquo;especially if my master has the good fortune to redress that injury, andright that wrong, and kill that son of a bitch of a giant your worshipspeaks of; as kill him he will if he meets him, unless, indeed, he happensto be a phantom; for my master has no power at all against phantoms. Butone thing among others I would beg of you, señor licentiate, which is,that, to prevent my master taking a fancy to be an archbishop, for that iswhat I&rsquo;m afraid of, your worship would recommend him to marry thisprincess at once; for in this way he will be disabled from takingarchbishop&rsquo;s orders, and will easily come into his empire, and I to theend of my desires; I have been thinking over the matter carefully, and bywhat I can make out I find it will not do for me that my master shouldbecome an archbishop, because I am no good for the Church, as I ammarried; and for me now, having as I have a wife and children, to setabout obtaining dispensations to enable me to hold a place of profit underthe Church, would be endless work; so that, señor, it all turns on mymaster marrying this lady at once&mdash;for as yet I do not know hergrace, and so I cannot call her by her name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is called the Princess Micomicona,&rdquo; said the curate; &ldquo;for as herkingdom is Micomicon, it is clear that must be her name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt of that,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;for I have known many to taketheir name and title from the place where they were born and callthemselves Pedro of Alcalá, Juan of Úbeda, and Diego of Valladolid; and itmay be that over there in Guinea queens have the same way of taking thenames of their kingdoms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it may,&rdquo; said the curate; &ldquo;and as for your master&rsquo;s marrying, I willdo all in my power towards it:&rdquo; with which Sancho was as much pleased asthe curate was amazed at his simplicity and at seeing what a hold theabsurdities of his master had taken of his fancy, for he had evidentlypersuaded himself that he was going to be an emperor.</p><p>By this time Dorothea had seated herself upon the curate&rsquo;s mule, and thebarber had fitted the ox-tail beard to his face, and they now told Sanchoto conduct them to where Don Quixote was, warning him not to say that heknew either the licentiate or the barber, as his master&rsquo;s becoming anemperor entirely depended on his not recognising them; neither the curatenor Cardenio, however, thought fit to go with them; Cardenio lest heshould remind Don Quixote of the quarrel he had with him, and the curateas there was no necessity for his presence just yet, so they allowed theothers to go on before them, while they themselves followed slowly onfoot. The curate did not forget to instruct Dorothea how to act, but shesaid they might make their minds easy, as everything would be done exactlyas the books of chivalry required and described.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c29c" id="c29c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c29c.jpg (286K)" src="images/c29c.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c29c.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>They had gone about three-quarters of a league when they discovered DonQuixote in a wilderness of rocks, by this time clothed, but without hisarmour; and as soon as Dorothea saw him and was told by Sancho that thatwas Don Quixote, she whipped her palfrey, the well-bearded barberfollowing her, and on coming up to him her squire sprang from his mule andcame forward to receive her in his arms, and she dismounting with greatease of manner advanced to kneel before the feet of Don Quixote; andthough he strove to raise her up, she without rising addressed him in thisfashion:</p><p>&ldquo;From this spot I will not rise, valiant and doughty knight, until yourgoodness and courtesy grant me a boon, which will redound to the honourand renown of your person and render a service to the most disconsolateand afflicted damsel the sun has seen; and if the might of your strong armcorresponds to the repute of your immortal fame, you are bound to aid thehelpless being who, led by the savour of your renowned name, hath comefrom far distant lands to seek your aid in her misfortunes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will not answer a word, beauteous lady,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;nor willI listen to anything further concerning you, until you rise from theearth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will not rise, señor,&rdquo; answered the afflicted damsel, &ldquo;unless of yourcourtesy the boon I ask is first granted me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I grant and accord it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;provided without detriment orprejudice to my king, my country, or her who holds the key of my heart andfreedom, it may be complied with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will not be to the detriment or prejudice of any of them, my worthylord,&rdquo; said the afflicted damsel; and here Sancho Panza drew close to hismaster&rsquo;s ear and said to him very softly, &ldquo;Your worship may very safelygrant the boon she asks; it&rsquo;s nothing at all; only to kill a big giant;and she who asks it is the exalted Princess Micomicona, queen of the greatkingdom of Micomicon of Ethiopia.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let her be who she may,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;I will do what is mybounden duty, and what my conscience bids me, in conformity with what Ihave professed;&rdquo; and turning to the damsel he said, &ldquo;Let your great beautyrise, for I grant the boon which you would ask of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then what I ask,&rdquo; said the damsel, &ldquo;is that your magnanimous personaccompany me at once whither I will conduct you, and that you promise notto engage in any other adventure or quest until you have avenged me of atraitor who against all human and divine law, has usurped my kingdom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I repeat that I grant it,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;and so, lady, you mayfrom this day forth lay aside the melancholy that distresses you, and letyour failing hopes gather new life and strength, for with the help of Godand of my arm you will soon see yourself restored to your kingdom, andseated upon the throne of your ancient and mighty realm, notwithstandingand despite of the felons who would gainsay it; and now hands to the work,for in delay there is apt to be danger.&rdquo;</p><p>The distressed damsel strove with much pertinacity to kiss his hands; butDon Quixote, who was in all things a polished and courteous knight, wouldby no means allow it, but made her rise and embraced her with greatcourtesy and politeness, and ordered Sancho to look to Rocinante&rsquo;s girths,and to arm him without a moment&rsquo;s delay. Sancho took down the armour,which was hung up on a tree like a trophy, and having seen to the girthsarmed his master in a trice, who as soon as he found himself in his armourexclaimed:</p><p>&ldquo;Let us be gone in the name of God to bring aid to this great lady.&rdquo;</p><p>The barber was all this time on his knees at great pains to hide hislaughter and not let his beard fall, for had it fallen maybe their finescheme would have come to nothing; but now seeing the boon granted, andthe promptitude with which Don Quixote prepared to set out in compliancewith it, he rose and took his lady&rsquo;s hand, and between them they placedher upon the mule. Don Quixote then mounted Rocinante, and the barbersettled himself on his beast, Sancho being left to go on foot, which madehim feel anew the loss of his Dapple, finding the want of him now. But hebore all with cheerfulness, being persuaded that his master had now fairlystarted and was just on the point of becoming an emperor; for he felt nodoubt at all that he would marry this princess, and be king of Micomiconat least. The only thing that troubled him was the reflection that thiskingdom was in the land of the blacks, and that the people they would givehim for vassals would be all black; but for this he soon found a remedy inhis fancy, and said he to himself, &ldquo;What is it to me if my vassals areblacks? What more have I to do than make a cargo of them and carry them toSpain, where I can sell them and get ready money for them, and with it buysome title or some office in which to live at ease all the days of mylife? Not unless you go to sleep and haven&rsquo;t the wit or skill to turnthings to account and sell three, six, or ten thousand vassals while youwould be talking about it! By God I will stir them up, big and little, oras best I can, and let them be ever so black I&rsquo;ll turn them into white oryellow. Come, come, what a fool I am!&rdquo; And so he jogged on, so occupiedwith his thoughts and easy in his mind that he forgot all about thehardship of travelling on foot.</p><p>Cardenio and the curate were watching all this from among some bushes, notknowing how to join company with the others; but the curate, who was veryfertile in devices, soon hit upon a way of effecting their purpose, andwith a pair of scissors he had in a case he quickly cut off Cardenio&rsquo;sbeard, and putting on him a grey jerkin of his own he gave him a blackcloak, leaving himself in his breeches and doublet, while Cardenio&rsquo;sappearance was so different from what it had been that he would not haveknown himself had he seen himself in a mirror. Having effected this,although the others had gone on ahead while they were disguisingthemselves, they easily came out on the high road before them, for thebrambles and awkward places they encountered did not allow those onhorseback to go as fast as those on foot. They then posted themselves onthe level ground at the outlet of the Sierra, and as soon as Don Quixoteand his companions emerged from it the curate began to examine him verydeliberately, as though he were striving to recognise him, and afterhaving stared at him for some time he hastened towards him with open armsexclaiming, &ldquo;A happy meeting with the mirror of chivalry, my worthycompatriot Don Quixote of La Mancha, the flower and cream of highbreeding, the protection and relief of the distressed, the quintessence ofknights-errant!&rdquo; And so saying he clasped in his arms the knee of DonQuixote&rsquo;s left leg. He, astonished at the stranger&rsquo;s words and behaviour,looked at him attentively, and at length recognised him, very muchsurprised to see him there, and made great efforts to dismount. This,however, the curate would not allow, on which Don Quixote said, &ldquo;Permitme, señor licentiate, for it is not fitting that I should be on horsebackand so reverend a person as your worship on foot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On no account will I allow it,&rdquo; said the curate; &ldquo;your mightiness mustremain on horseback, for it is on horseback you achieve the greatest deedsand adventures that have been beheld in our age; as for me, an unworthypriest, it will serve me well enough to mount on the haunches of one ofthe mules of these gentlefolk who accompany your worship, if they have noobjection, and I will fancy I am mounted on the steed Pegasus, or on thezebra or charger that bore the famous Moor, Muzaraque, who to this daylies enchanted in the great hill of Zulema, a little distance from thegreat Complutum.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nor even that will I consent to, señor licentiate,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote,&ldquo;and I know it will be the good pleasure of my lady the princess, out oflove for me, to order her squire to give up the saddle of his mule to yourworship, and he can sit behind if the beast will bear it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will, I am sure,&rdquo; said the princess, &ldquo;and I am sure, too, that I neednot order my squire, for he is too courteous and considerate to allow aChurchman to go on foot when he might be mounted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That he is,&rdquo; said the barber, and at once alighting, he offered hissaddle to the curate, who accepted it without much entreaty; butunfortunately as the barber was mounting behind, the mule, being as ithappened a hired one, which is the same thing as saying ill-conditioned,lifted its hind hoofs and let fly a couple of kicks in the air, whichwould have made Master Nicholas wish his expedition in quest of DonQuixote at the devil had they caught him on the breast or head. As it was,they so took him by surprise that he came to the ground, giving so littleheed to his beard that it fell off, and all he could do when he foundhimself without it was to cover his face hastily with both his hands andmoan that his teeth were knocked out. Don Quixote when he saw all thatbundle of beard detached, without jaws or blood, from the face of thefallen squire, exclaimed:</p><p>&ldquo;By the living God, but this is a great miracle! it has knocked off andplucked away the beard from his face as if it had been shaved offdesignedly.&rdquo;</p><p>The curate, seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his scheme, atonce pounced upon the beard and hastened with it to where Master Nicholaslay, still uttering moans, and drawing his head to his breast had it on inan instant, muttering over him some words which he said were a certainspecial charm for sticking on beards, as they would see; and as soon as hehad it fixed he left him, and the squire appeared well bearded and wholeas before, whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure astonished, and beggedthe curate to teach him that charm when he had an opportunity, as he waspersuaded its virtue must extend beyond the sticking on of beards, for itwas clear that where the beard had been stripped off the flesh must haveremained torn and lacerated, and when it could heal all that it must begood for more than beards.</p><p>&ldquo;And so it is,&rdquo; said the curate, and he promised to teach it to him on thefirst opportunity. They then agreed that for the present the curate shouldmount, and that the three should ride by turns until they reached the inn,which might be about six leagues from where they were.</p><p>Three then being mounted, that is to say, Don Quixote, the princess, andthe curate, and three on foot, Cardenio, the barber, and Sancho Panza, DonQuixote said to the damsel:</p><p>&ldquo;Let your highness, lady, lead on whithersoever is most pleasing to you;&rdquo;but before she could answer the licentiate said:</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c29d" id="c29d"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c29d.jpg (345K)" src="images/c29d.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c29d.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Towards what kingdom would your ladyship direct our course?

I will only say, señora, that whether it hasmight or not, that which it may or may not have shall be devoted to yourservice even to death; and now, leaving this to its proper season, I wouldask the señor licentiate to tell me what it is that has brought him intothese parts, alone, unattended, and so lightly clad that I am filled withamazement.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will answer that briefly,&rdquo; replied the curate; &ldquo;you must know then,Señor Don Quixote, that Master Nicholas, our friend and barber, and I weregoing to Seville to receive some money that a relative of mine who went tothe Indies many years ago had sent me, and not such a small sum but thatit was over sixty thousand pieces of eight, full weight, which issomething; and passing by this place yesterday we were attacked by fourfootpads, who stripped us even to our beards, and them they stripped offso that the barber found it necessary to put on a false one, and even thisyoung man here&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to Cardenio&mdash;&ldquo;they completelytransformed. But the best of it is, the story goes in the neighbourhoodthat those who attacked us belong to a number of galley slaves who, theysay, were set free almost on the very same spot by a man of such valourthat, in spite of the commissary and of the guards, he released the wholeof them; and beyond all doubt he must have been out of his senses, or hemust be as great a scoundrel as they, or some man without heart orconscience to let the wolf loose among the sheep, the fox among the hens,the fly among the honey. He has defrauded justice, and opposed his kingand lawful master, for he opposed his just commands; he has, I say, robbedthe galleys of their feet, stirred up the Holy Brotherhood which for manyyears past has been quiet, and, lastly, has done a deed by which his soulmay be lost without any gain to his body.&rdquo; Sancho had told the curate andthe barber of the adventure of the galley slaves, which, so much to hisglory, his master had achieved, and hence the curate in alluding to itmade the most of it to see what would be said or done by Don Quixote; whochanged colour at every word, not daring to say that it was he who hadbeen the liberator of those worthy people. &ldquo;These, then,&rdquo; said the curate,&ldquo;were they who robbed us; and God in his mercy pardon him who would notlet them go to the punishment they deserved.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c29f" id="c29f"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c29f.jpg (53K)" src="images/c29f.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c29f.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF ADDRESS DISPLAYED BY THE FAIR DOROTHEA, WITH OTHER MATTERSPLEASANT AND AMUSING</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c30a" id="c30a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c30a.jpg (147K)" src="images/c30a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c30a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The curate had hardly ceased speaking, when Sancho said, &ldquo;In faith, then,señor licentiate, he who did that deed was my master; and it was not forwant of my telling him beforehand and warning him to mind what he wasabout, and that it was a sin to set them at liberty, as they were all onthe march there because they were special scoundrels.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Blockhead!&rdquo; said Don Quixote at this, &ldquo;it is no business or concern ofknights-errant to inquire whether any persons in affliction, in chains, oroppressed that they may meet on the high roads go that way and suffer asthey do because of their faults or because of their misfortunes. It onlyconcerns them to aid them as persons in need of help, having regard totheir sufferings and not to their rascalities. I encountered a chaplet orstring of miserable and unfortunate people, and did for them what my senseof duty demands of me, and as for the rest be that as it may; and whoevertakes objection to it, saving the sacred dignity of the señor licentiateand his honoured person, I say he knows little about chivalry and lieslike a whoreson villain, and this I will give him to know to the fullestextent with my sword;&rdquo; and so saying he settled himself in his stirrupsand pressed down his morion; for the barber&rsquo;s basin, which according tohim was Mambrino&rsquo;s helmet, he carried hanging at the saddle-bow until hecould repair the damage done to it by the galley slaves.</p><p>Dorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughlyunderstood Don Quixote&rsquo;s crazy turn, and that all except Sancho Panza weremaking game of him, not to be behind the rest said to him, on observinghis irritation, &ldquo;Sir Knight, remember the boon you have promised me, andthat in accordance with it you must not engage in any other adventure, beit ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if the licentiate had known thatthe galley slaves had been set free by that unconquered arm he would havestopped his mouth thrice over, or even bitten his tongue three timesbefore he would have said a word that tended towards disrespect of yourworship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I swear heartily,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;and I would have even pluckedoff a moustache.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will hold my peace, señora,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and I will curb thenatural anger that had arisen in my breast, and will proceed in peace andquietness until I have fulfilled my promise; but in return for thisconsideration I entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to do so,what is the nature of your trouble, and how many, who, and what are thepersons of whom I am to require due satisfaction, and on whom I am to takevengeance on your behalf?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I will do with all my heart,&rdquo; replied Dorothea, &ldquo;if it will not bewearisome to you to hear of miseries and misfortunes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will not be wearisome, señora,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; to which Dorotheareplied, &ldquo;Well, if that be so, give me your attention.&rdquo; As soon as shesaid this, Cardenio and the barber drew close to her side, eager to hearwhat sort of story the quick-witted Dorothea would invent for herself; andSancho did the same, for he was as much taken in by her as his master; andshe having settled herself comfortably in the saddle, and with the help ofcoughing and other preliminaries taken time to think, began with greatsprightliness of manner in this fashion.</p><p>&ldquo;First of all, I would have you know, sirs, that my name is&mdash;&rdquo;and here she stopped for a moment, for she forgot the name the curate had givenher; but he came to her relief, seeing what her difficulty was, and said,&ldquo;It is no wonder, señora, that your highness should be confused andembarrassed in telling the tale of your misfortunes; for such afflictions oftenhave the effect of depriving the sufferers of memory, so that they do not evenremember their own names, as is the case now with your ladyship, who hasforgotten that she is called the Princess Micomicona, lawful heiress of thegreat kingdom of Micomicon; and with this cue your highness may now recall toyour sorrowful recollection all you may wish to tell us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the truth,&rdquo; said the damsel; &ldquo;but I think from this on I shallhave no need of any prompting, and I shall bring my true story safe intoport, and here it is. The king my father, who was called Tinacrio theSapient, was very learned in what they call magic arts, and became awareby his craft that my mother, who was called Queen Jaramilla, was to diebefore he did, and that soon after he too was to depart this life, and Iwas to be left an orphan without father or mother. But all this, hedeclared, did not so much grieve or distress him as his certain knowledgethat a prodigious giant, the lord of a great island close to our kingdom,Pandafilando of the Scowl by name&mdash;for it is averred that, though his eyesare properly placed and straight, he always looks askew as if he squinted,and this he does out of malignity, to strike fear and terror into those helooks at&mdash;that he knew, I say, that this giant on becoming aware of myorphan condition would overrun my kingdom with a mighty force and strip meof all, not leaving me even a small village to shelter me; but that Icould avoid all this ruin and misfortune if I were willing to marry him;however, as far as he could see, he never expected that I would consent toa marriage so unequal; and he said no more than the truth in this, for ithas never entered my mind to marry that giant, or any other, let him beever so great or enormous. My father said, too, that when he was dead, andI saw Pandafilando about to invade my kingdom, I was not to wait andattempt to defend myself, for that would be destructive to me, but that Ishould leave the kingdom entirely open to him if I wished to avoid thedeath and total destruction of my good and loyal vassals, for there wouldbe no possibility of defending myself against the giant&rsquo;s devilish power;and that I should at once with some of my followers set out for Spain,where I should obtain relief in my distress on finding a certainknight-errant whose fame by that time would extend over the whole kingdom,and who would be called, if I remember rightly, Don Azote or Don Gigote.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don Quixote,&rsquo; he must have said, señora,&rdquo; observed Sancho at this,&ldquo;otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is it,&rdquo; said Dorothea; &ldquo;he said, moreover, that he would be tall ofstature and lank featured; and that on his right side under the leftshoulder, or thereabouts, he would have a grey mole with hairs likebristles.&rdquo;</p><p>On hearing this, Don Quixote said to his squire, &ldquo;Here, Sancho my son,bear a hand and help me to strip, for I want to see if I am the knightthat sage king foretold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What does your worship want to strip for?&rdquo; said Dorothea.</p><p>&ldquo;To see if I have that mole your father spoke of,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;There is no occasion to strip,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;for I know your worship hasjust such a mole on the middle of your backbone, which is the mark of astrong man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is enough,&rdquo; said Dorothea, &ldquo;for with friends we must not look tooclosely into trifles; and whether it be on the shoulder or on the backbonematters little; it is enough if there is a mole, be it where it may, forit is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit the truth in everyparticular, and I have made a lucky hit in commending myself to DonQuixote; for he is the one my father spoke of, as the features of hiscountenance correspond with those assigned to this knight by that widefame he has acquired not only in Spain but in all La Mancha; for I hadscarcely landed at Osuna when I heard such accounts of his achievements,that at once my heart told me he was the very one I had come in searchof.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But how did you land at Osuna, señora,&rdquo; asked Don Quixote, &ldquo;when it isnot a seaport?&rdquo;</p><p>But before Dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her, saying, &ldquo;Theprincess meant to say that after she had landed at Malaga the first placewhere she heard of your worship was Osuna.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is what I meant to say,&rdquo; said Dorothea.</p><p>&ldquo;And that would be only natural,&rdquo; said the curate. &ldquo;Will your majestyplease proceed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no more to add,&rdquo; said Dorothea, &ldquo;save that in finding DonQuixote I have had such good fortune, that I already reckon and regardmyself queen and mistress of my entire dominions, since of his courtesyand magnanimity he has granted me the boon of accompanying mewhithersoever I may conduct him, which will be only to bring him face toface with Pandafilando of the Scowl, that he may slay him and restore tome what has been unjustly usurped by him: for all this must come to passsatisfactorily since my good father Tinacrio the Sapient foretold it, wholikewise left it declared in writing in Chaldee or Greek characters (for Icannot read them), that if this predicted knight, after having cut thegiant&rsquo;s throat, should be disposed to marry me I was to offer myself atonce without demur as his lawful wife, and yield him possession of mykingdom together with my person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What thinkest thou now, friend Sancho?&rdquo; said Don Quixote at this.&ldquo;Hearest thou that? Did I not tell thee so? See how we have already got akingdom to govern and a queen to marry!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On my oath it is so,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;and foul fortune to him who won&rsquo;tmarry after slitting Señor Pandahilado&rsquo;s windpipe! And then, howillfavoured the queen is! I wish the fleas in my bed were that sort!&rdquo;</p><p>And so saying he cut a couple of capers in the air with every sign ofextreme satisfaction, and then ran to seize the bridle of Dorothea&rsquo;s mule,and checking it fell on his knees before her, begging her to give him herhand to kiss in token of his acknowledgment of her as his queen andmistress. Which of the bystanders could have helped laughing to see themadness of the master and the simplicity of the servant? Dorotheatherefore gave her hand, and promised to make him a great lord in herkingdom, when Heaven should be so good as to permit her to recover andenjoy it, for which Sancho returned thanks in words that set them alllaughing again.</p><p>&ldquo;This, sirs,&rdquo; continued Dorothea, &ldquo;is my story; it only remains to tellyou that of all the attendants I took with me from my kingdom I have noneleft except this well-bearded squire, for all were drowned in a greattempest we encountered when in sight of port; and he and I came to land ona couple of planks as if by a miracle; and indeed the whole course of mylife is a miracle and a mystery as you may have observed; and if I havebeen over minute in any respect or not as precise as I ought, let it beaccounted for by what the licentiate said at the beginning of my tale,that constant and excessive troubles deprive the sufferers of theirmemory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They shall not deprive me of mine, exalted and worthy princess,&rdquo;said Don Quixote, &ldquo;however great and unexampled those which I shallendure in your service may be; and here I confirm anew the boon I have promisedyou, and I swear to go with you to the end of the world until I find myself inthe presence of your fierce enemy, whose haughty head I trust by the aid of myarm to cut off with the edge of this&mdash;I will not say good sword, thanks toGines de Pasamonte who carried away mine&rdquo;&mdash;(this he said between histeeth, and then continued), &ldquo;and when it has been cut off and you havebeen put in peaceful possession of your realm it shall be left to your owndecision to dispose of your person as may be most pleasing to you; for so longas my memory is occupied, my will enslaved, and my understanding enthralled byher&mdash;I say no more&mdash;it is impossible for me for a moment tocontemplate marriage, even with a Phœnix.&rdquo;</p><p>The last words of his master about not wanting to marry were sodisagreeable to Sancho that raising his voice he exclaimed with greatirritation:</p><p>&ldquo;By my oath, Señor Don Quixote, you are not in your right senses; for howcan your worship possibly object to marrying such an exalted princess asthis? Do you think Fortune will offer you behind every stone such a pieceof luck as is offered you now? Is my lady Dulcinea fairer, perchance? Notshe; nor half as fair; and I will even go so far as to say she does notcome up to the shoe of this one here. A poor chance I have of getting thatcounty I am waiting for if your worship goes looking for dainties in thebottom of the sea. In the devil&rsquo;s name, marry, marry, and take thiskingdom that comes to hand without any trouble, and when you are king makeme a marquis or governor of a province, and for the rest let the deviltake it all.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote, when he heard such blasphemies uttered against his ladyDulcinea, could not endure it, and lifting his pike, without sayinganything to Sancho or uttering a word, he gave him two such thwacks thathe brought him to the ground; and had it not been that Dorothea cried outto him to spare him he would have no doubt taken his life on the spot.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; he said to him after a pause, &ldquo;you scurvy clown, that youare to be always interfering with me, and that you are to be alwaysoffending and I always pardoning? Don&rsquo;t fancy it, impious scoundrel, forthat beyond a doubt thou art, since thou hast set thy tongue going againstthe peerless Dulcinea. Know you not, lout, vagabond, beggar, that were itnot for the might that she infuses into my arm I should not have strengthenough to kill a flea? Say, scoffer with a viper&rsquo;s tongue, what think youhas won this kingdom and cut off this giant&rsquo;s head and made you a marquis(for all this I count as already accomplished and decided), but the mightof Dulcinea, employing my arm as the instrument of her achievements? Shefights in me and conquers in me, and I live and breathe in her, and owe mylife and being to her. O whoreson scoundrel, how ungrateful you are, yousee yourself raised from the dust of the earth to be a titled lord, andthe return you make for so great a benefit is to speak evil of her who hasconferred it upon you!&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho was not so stunned but that he heard all his master said, andrising with some degree of nimbleness he ran to place himself behindDorothea&rsquo;s palfrey, and from that position he said to his master:</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, señor; if your worship is resolved not to marry this greatprincess, it is plain the kingdom will not be yours; and not being so, howcan you bestow favours upon me? That is what I complain of. Let yourworship at any rate marry this queen, now that we have got her here as ifshowered down from heaven, and afterwards you may go back to my ladyDulcinea; for there must have been kings in the world who kept mistresses.As to beauty, I have nothing to do with it; and if the truth is to betold, I like them both; though I have never seen the lady Dulcinea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How! never seen her, blasphemous traitor!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Quixote; &ldquo;hastthou not just now brought me a message from her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that I did not see her so much at my leisure thatI could take particular notice of her beauty, or of her charms piecemeal;but taken in the lump I like her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now I forgive thee,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;and do thou forgive me the injuryI have done thee; for our first impulses are not in our control.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I see,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;and with me the wish to speak is always thefirst impulse, and I cannot help saying, once at any rate, what I have onthe tip of my tongue.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;take heed of what thou sayest,for the pitcher goes so often to the well&mdash;I need say no more to thee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;God is in heaven, and sees all tricks, andwill judge who does most harm, I in not speaking right, or your worship innot doing it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is enough,&rdquo; said Dorothea; &ldquo;run, Sancho, and kiss your lord&rsquo;s handand beg his pardon, and henceforward be more circumspect with your praiseand abuse; and say nothing in disparagement of that lady Toboso, of whom Iknow nothing save that I am her servant; and put your trust in God, foryou will not fail to obtain some dignity so as to live like a prince.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho advanced hanging his head and begged his master&rsquo;s hand, which DonQuixote with dignity presented to him, giving him his blessing as soon ashe had kissed it; he then bade him go on ahead a little, as he hadquestions to ask him and matters of great importance to discuss with him.Sancho obeyed, and when the two had gone some distance in advance DonQuixote said to him, &ldquo;Since thy return I have had no opportunity or timeto ask thee many particulars touching thy mission and the answer thou hastbrought back, and now that chance has granted us the time and opportunity,deny me not the happiness thou canst give me by such good news.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let your worship ask what you will,&rdquo; answered Sancho, &ldquo;for I shall find away out of all as I found a way in; but I implore you, señor, notto be so revengeful in future.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why dost thou say that, Sancho?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;I say it,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;because those blows just now were more becauseof the quarrel the devil stirred up between us both the other night, thanfor what I said against my lady Dulcinea, whom I love and reverence as Iwould a relic&mdash;though there is nothing of that about her&mdash;merely assomething belonging to your worship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say no more on that subject for thy life, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;forit is displeasing to me; I have already pardoned thee for that, and thouknowest the common saying, &lsquo;for a fresh sin a fresh penance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>While this was going on they saw coming along the road they were followinga man mounted on an ass, who when he came close seemed to be a gipsy; butSancho Panza, whose eyes and heart were there wherever he saw asses, nosooner beheld the man than he knew him to be Gines de Pasamonte; and bythe thread of the gipsy he got at the ball, his ass, for it was, in fact,Dapple that carried Pasamonte, who to escape recognition and to sell theass had disguised himself as a gipsy, being able to speak the gipsylanguage, and many more, as well as if they were his own. Sancho saw himand recognised him, and the instant he did so he shouted to him,&ldquo;Ginesillo, you thief, give up my treasure, release my life, embarrassthyself not with my repose, quit my ass, leave my delight, be off, rip,get thee gone, thief, and give up what is not thine.&rdquo;</p><p>There was no necessity for so many words or objurgations, for at the firstone Gines jumped down, and at a like racing speed made off and got clearof them all. Sancho hastened to his Dapple, and embracing him he said,&ldquo;How hast thou fared, my blessing, Dapple of my eyes, my comrade?&rdquo; all thewhile kissing him and caressing him as if he were a human being. The assheld his peace, and let himself be kissed and caressed by Sancho withoutanswering a single word. They all came up and congratulated him on havingfound Dapple, Don Quixote especially, who told him that notwithstandingthis he would not cancel the order for the three ass-colts, for whichSancho thanked him.</p><p>While the two had been going along conversing in this fashion, the curateobserved to Dorothea that she had shown great cleverness, as well in thestory itself as in its conciseness, and the resemblance it bore to thoseof the books of chivalry. She said that she had many times amused herselfreading them; but that she did not know the situation of the provinces orseaports, and so she had said at haphazard that she had landed at Osuna.</p><p>&ldquo;So I saw,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;and for that reason I made haste to say whatI did, by which it was all set right. But is it not a strange thing to seehow readily this unhappy gentleman believes all these figments and lies,simply because they are in the style and manner of the absurdities of hisbooks?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Cardenio; &ldquo;and so uncommon and unexampled, that were oneto attempt to invent and concoct it in fiction, I doubt if there be anywit keen enough to imagine it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But another strange thing about it,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;is that, apartfrom the silly things which this worthy gentleman says in connection withhis craze, when other subjects are dealt with, he can discuss them in aperfectly rational manner, showing that his mind is quite clear andcomposed; so that, provided his chivalry is not touched upon, no one wouldtake him to be anything but a man of thoroughly sound understanding.&rdquo;</p><p>While they were holding this conversation Don Quixote continued his withSancho, saying:</p><p>&ldquo;Friend Panza, let us forgive and forget as to our quarrels, and tell menow, dismissing anger and irritation, where, how, and when didst thou findDulcinea? What was she doing? What didst thou say to her? What did sheanswer? How did she look when she was reading my letter? Who copied it outfor thee? and everything in the matter that seems to thee worth knowing,asking, and learning; neither adding nor falsifying to give me pleasure,nor yet curtailing lest you should deprive me of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;if the truth is to be told, nobody copied outthe letter for me, for I carried no letter at all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is as thou sayest,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for the notebook in which Iwrote it I found in my own possession two days after thy departure, whichgave me very great vexation, as I knew not what thou wouldst do on findingthyself without any letter; and I made sure thou wouldst return from theplace where thou didst first miss it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I should have done,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;if I had not got it by heart whenyour worship read it to me, so that I repeated it to a sacristan, whocopied it out for me from hearing it, so exactly that he said in all thedays of his life, though he had read many a letter of excommunication, hehad never seen or read so pretty a letter as that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And hast thou got it still in thy memory, Sancho?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;No, señor,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;for as soon as I had repeatedit, seeing there was no further use for it, I set about forgetting it; and if Irecollect any of it, it is that about &lsquo;Scrubbing,&rsquo; I mean to say&lsquo;Sovereign Lady,&rsquo; and the end &lsquo;Yours till death, the Knightof the Rueful Countenance;&rsquo; and between these two I put into it more thanthree hundred &lsquo;my souls&rsquo; and &lsquo;my life&rsquo;s&rsquo; and&lsquo;my eyes.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c30e" id="c30e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c30e.jpg (13K)" src="images/c30e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.<br/>OF THE DELECTABLE DISCUSSION BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO PANZA, HISSQUIRE, TOGETHER WITH OTHER INCIDENTS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c31a" id="c31a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c31a.jpg (151K)" src="images/c31a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c31a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;All that is not unsatisfactory to me,&rdquo; said Don Quixote. &ldquo;Go on; thoudidst reach her; and what was that queen of beauty doing? Surely thoudidst find her stringing pearls, or embroidering some device in goldthread for this her enslaved knight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but I found her winnowing two bushels of wheatin the yard of her house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then depend upon it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;the grains of that wheat werepearls when touched by her hands; and didst thou look, friend? was itwhite wheat or brown?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was neither, but red,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Then I promise thee,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that, winnowed by her hands,beyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest; but go on; when thougavest her my letter, did she kiss it? Did she place it on her head? Didshe perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I went to give it to her,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;she was hard at itswaying from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the sieve, andshe said to me, &lsquo;Lay the letter, friend, on the top of that sack, for Icannot read it until I have done sifting all this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Discreet lady!&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;that was in order to read it at herleisure and enjoy it; proceed, Sancho; while she was engaged in heroccupation what converse did she hold with thee? What did she ask aboutme, and what answer didst thou give? Make haste; tell me all, and let notan atom be left behind in the ink-bottle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She asked me nothing,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;but I told her how your worship wasleft doing penance in her service, naked from the waist up, in among thesemountains like a savage, sleeping on the ground, not eating bread off atablecloth nor combing your beard, weeping and cursing your fortune.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In saying I cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;forrather do I bless it and shall bless it all the days of my life for havingmade me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady as Dulcinea delToboso.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And so lofty she is,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that she overtops me by more than ahand&rsquo;s-breadth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;didst thou measure with her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I measured in this way,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;going to help her to put a sack ofwheat on the back of an ass, we came so close together that I could seeshe stood more than a good palm over me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and doth she not of a truth accompany and adornthis greatness with a thousand million charms of mind! But one thing thouwilt not deny, Sancho; when thou camest close to her didst thou notperceive a Sabæan odour, an aromatic fragrance, a, I know not what,delicious, that I cannot find a name for; I mean a redolence, anexhalation, as if thou wert in the shop of some dainty glover?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All I can say is,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that I did perceive a little odour,something goaty; it must have been that she was all in a sweat with hardwork.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It could not be that,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;but thou must have beensuffering from cold in the head, or must have smelt thyself; for I knowwell what would be the scent of that rose among thorns, that lily of thefield, that dissolved amber.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; replied Sancho; &ldquo;there often comes from myself that same odourwhich then seemed to me to come from her grace the lady Dulcinea; butthat&rsquo;s no wonder, for one devil is like another.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; continued Don Quixote, &ldquo;now she has done sifting the corn andsent it to the mill; what did she do when she read the letter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As for the letter,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;she did not read it, for she said shecould neither read nor write; instead of that she tore it up into smallpieces, saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lest hersecrets should become known in the village, and that what I had told herby word of mouth about the love your worship bore her, and theextraordinary penance you were doing for her sake, was enough; and, tomake an end of it, she told me to tell your worship that she kissed yourhands, and that she had a greater desire to see you than to write to you;and that therefore she entreated and commanded you, on sight of thispresent, to come out of these thickets, and to have done with carrying onabsurdities, and to set out at once for El Toboso, unless something elseof greater importance should happen, for she had a great desire to seeyour worship. She laughed greatly when I told her how your worship wascalled The Knight of the Rueful Countenance; I asked her if that Biscayanthe other day had been there; and she told me he had, and that he was anhonest fellow; I asked her too about the galley slaves, but she said shehad not seen any as yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So far all goes well,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but tell me whatjewel was it that she gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidingsof me? For it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant togive the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their ladies to theknights, or of their knights to the ladies, some rich jewel as a guerdon forgood news, and acknowledgment of the message.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is very likely,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and a good custom it was, to my mind;but that must have been in days gone by, for now it would seem to be thecustom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because that was what mylady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when I took leave ofher; and more by token it was sheep&rsquo;s-milk cheese.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is generous in the extreme,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and if she did notgive thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she had notone to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter; I shallsee her and all shall be made right. But knowest thou what amazes me,Sancho? It seems to me thou must have gone and come through the air, forthou hast taken but little more than three days to go to El Toboso andreturn, though it is more than thirty leagues from here to there. Fromwhich I am inclined to think that the sage magician who is my friend, andwatches over my interests (for of necessity there is and must be one, orelse I should not be a right knight-errant), that this same, I say, musthave helped thee to travel without thy knowledge; for some of these sageswill catch up a knight-errant sleeping in his bed, and without his knowinghow or in what way it happened, he wakes up the next day more than athousand leagues away from the place where he went to sleep. And if itwere not for this, knights-errant would not be able to give aid to oneanother in peril, as they do at every turn. For a knight, maybe, isfighting in the mountains of Armenia with some dragon, or fierce serpent,or another knight, and gets the worst of the battle, and is at the pointof death; but when he least looks for it, there appears over against himon a cloud, or chariot of fire, another knight, a friend of his, who justbefore had been in England, and who takes his part, and delivers him fromdeath; and at night he finds himself in his own quarters supping very muchto his satisfaction; and yet from one place to the other will have beentwo or three thousand leagues. And all this is done by the craft and skillof the sage enchanters who take care of those valiant knights; so that,friend Sancho, I find no difficulty in believing that thou mayest havegone from this place to El Toboso and returned in such a short time,since, as I have said, some friendly sage must have carried thee throughthe air without thee perceiving it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That must have been it,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for indeed Rocinante went like agipsy&rsquo;s ass with quicksilver in his ears.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Quicksilver!&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;aye and what is more, a legion ofdevils, folk that can travel and make others travel without being weary,exactly as the whim seizes them. But putting this aside, what thinkestthou I ought to do about my lady&rsquo;s command to go and see her? For though Ifeel that I am bound to obey her mandate, I feel too that I am debarred bythe boon I have accorded to the princess that accompanies us, and the lawof chivalry compels me to have regard for my word in preference to myinclination; on the one hand the desire to see my lady pursues andharasses me, on the other my solemn promise and the glory I shall win inthis enterprise urge and call me; but what I think I shall do is to travelwith all speed and reach quickly the place where this giant is, and on myarrival I shall cut off his head, and establish the princess peacefully inher realm, and forthwith I shall return to behold the light that lightensmy senses, to whom I shall make such excuses that she will be led toapprove of my delay, for she will see that it entirely tends to increaseher glory and fame; for all that I have won, am winning, or shall win byarms in this life, comes to me of the favour she extends to me, andbecause I am hers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! what a sad state your worship&rsquo;s brains are in!&rdquo; said Sancho. &ldquo;Tellme, señor, do you mean to travel all that way for nothing, and to let slipand lose so rich and great a match as this where they give as a portion akingdom that in sober truth I have heard say is more than twenty thousandleagues round about, and abounds with all things necessary to supporthuman life, and is bigger than Portugal and Castile put together? Peace,for the love of God! Blush for what you have said, and take my advice, andforgive me, and marry at once in the first village where there is acurate; if not, here is our licentiate who will do the businessbeautifully; remember, I am old enough to give advice, and this I amgiving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in the hand is better thana vulture on the wing, and he who has the good to his hand and chooses thebad, that the good he complains of may not come to him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look here, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote. &ldquo;If thou art advising me to marry,in order that immediately on slaying the giant I may become king, and beable to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have promised, let metell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy desires withoutmarrying; for before going into battle I will make it a stipulation that,if I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry, they shall give me aportion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon whomsoever Ichoose, and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou have me bestowit but upon thee?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is plain speaking,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;but let your worship take care tochoose it on the seacoast, so that if I don&rsquo;t like the life, I may be ableto ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said; don&rsquo;t mindgoing to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this giant and let usfinish off this business; for by God it strikes me it will be one of greathonour and great profit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and Iwill take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to seeDulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to anyone, or to thosewho are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for asDulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be known itis not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, if that be so,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;how is it that your worshipmakes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselves beforemy lady Dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your name to itthat you love her and are her lover? And as those who go must perforcekneel before her and say they come from your worship to submit themselvesto her, how can the thoughts of both of you be hid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O, how silly and simple thou art!&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;seest thou not,Sancho, that this tends to her greater exaltation? For thou must know thataccording to our way of thinking in chivalry, it is a high honour to alady to have many knights-errant in her service, whose thoughts never gobeyond serving her for her own sake, and who look for no other reward fortheir great and true devotion than that she should be willing to acceptthem as her knights.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is with that kind of love,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;I have heard preachers saywe ought to love our Lord, for himself alone, without being moved by thehope of glory or the fear of punishment; though for my part, I wouldrather love and serve him for what he could do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The devil take thee for a clown!&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and what shrewdthings thou sayest at times! One would think thou hadst studied.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In faith, then, I cannot even read.&rdquo;</p><p>Master Nicholas here called out to them to wait a while, as they wanted tohalt and drink at a little spring there was there. Don Quixote drew up,not a little to the satisfaction of Sancho, for he was by this time wearyof telling so many lies, and in dread of his master catching him tripping,for though he knew that Dulcinea was a peasant girl of El Toboso, he hadnever seen her in all his life. Cardenio had now put on the clothes whichDorothea was wearing when they found her, and though they were not verygood, they were far better than those he put off. They dismounted togetherby the side of the spring, and with what the curate had provided himselfwith at the inn they appeased, though not very well, the keen appetitethey all of them brought with them.</p><p>While they were so employed there happened to come by a youth passing onhis way, who stopping to examine the party at the spring, the next momentran to Don Quixote and clasping him round the legs, began to weep freely,saying, &ldquo;O, señor, do you not know me? Look at me well; I am that ladAndres that your worship released from the oak-tree where I was tied.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote recognised him, and taking his hand he turned to those presentand said: &ldquo;That your worships may see how important it is to haveknights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by tyrannical andwicked men in this world, I may tell you that some days ago passingthrough a wood, I heard cries and piteous complaints as of a person inpain and distress; I immediately hastened, impelled by my bounden duty, tothe quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me to proceed, and Ifound tied to an oak this lad who now stands before you, which in my heartI rejoice at, for his testimony will not permit me to depart from thetruth in any particular. He was, I say, tied to an oak, naked from thewaist up, and a clown, whom I afterwards found to be his master, wasscarifying him by lashes with the reins of his mare. As soon as I saw himI asked the reason of so cruel a flagellation. The boor replied that hewas flogging him because he was his servant and because of carelessnessthat proceeded rather from dishonesty than stupidity; on which this boysaid, &lsquo;Señor, he flogs me only because I ask for my wages.&rsquo; The mastermade I know not what speeches and explanations, which, though I listenedto them, I did not accept. In short, I compelled the clown to unbind him,and to swear he would take him with him, and pay him real by real, andperfumed into the bargain. Is not all this true, Andres my son? Didst thounot mark with what authority I commanded him, and with what humility hepromised to do all I enjoined, specified, and required of him? Answerwithout hesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place, that they maysee that it is as great an advantage as I say to have knights-errantabroad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that your worship has said is quite true,&rdquo; answered the lad; &ldquo;but theend of the business turned out just the opposite of what your worshipsupposes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How! the opposite?&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;did not the clown pay thee then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not only did he not pay me,&rdquo; replied the lad, &ldquo;but as soon as yourworship had passed out of the wood and we were alone, he tied me up againto the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging, that left me like a flayedSaint Bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he followed up with somejest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship, and but for thepain I was suffering I should have laughed at the things he said. In shorthe left me in such a condition that I have been until now in a hospitalgetting cured of the injuries which that rascally clown inflicted on methen; for all which your worship is to blame; for if you had gone your ownway and not come where there was no call for you, nor meddled in otherpeople&rsquo;s affairs, my master would have been content with giving me one ortwo dozen lashes, and would have then loosed me and paid me what he owedme; but when your worship abused him so out of measure, and gave him somany hard words, his anger was kindled; and as he could not revengehimself on you, as soon as he saw you had left him the storm burst upon mein such a way, that I feel as if I should never be a man again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The mischief,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;lay in my going away; for I should nothave gone until I had seen thee paid; because I ought to have known wellby long experience that there is no clown who will keep his word if hefinds it will not suit him to keep it; but thou rememberest, Andres, thatI swore if he did not pay thee I would go and seek him, and find himthough he were to hide himself in the whale&rsquo;s belly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Andres; &ldquo;but it was of no use.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou shalt see now whether it is of use or not,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; and sosaying, he got up hastily and bade Sancho bridle Rocinante, who wasbrowsing while they were eating. Dorothea asked him what he meant to do.He replied that he meant to go in search of this clown and chastise himfor such iniquitous conduct, and see Andres paid to the last maravedi,despite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world. To which shereplied that he must remember that in accordance with his promise he couldnot engage in any enterprise until he had concluded hers; and that as heknew this better than anyone, he should restrain his ardour until hisreturn from her kingdom.</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and Andres must have patience until myreturn as you say, señora; but I once more swear and promise not to stopuntil I have seen him avenged and paid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have no faith in those oaths,&rdquo; said Andres; &ldquo;I would rather have nowsomething to help me to get to Seville than all the revenges in the world;if you have here anything to eat that I can take with me, give it me, andGod be with your worship and all knights-errant; and may their errandsturn out as well for themselves as they have for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho took out from his store a piece of bread and another of cheese, andgiving them to the lad he said, &ldquo;Here, take this, brother Andres, for wehave all of us a share in your misfortune.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, what share have you got?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This share of bread and cheese I am giving you,&rdquo; answered Sancho; &ldquo;andGod knows whether I shall feel the want of it myself or not; for I wouldhave you know, friend, that we squires to knights-errant have to bear agreat deal of hunger and hard fortune, and even other things more easilyfelt than told.&rdquo;</p><p>Andres seized his bread and cheese, and seeing that nobody gave himanything more, bent his head, and took hold of the road, as the saying is.However, before leaving he said, &ldquo;For the love of God, sir knight-errant,if you ever meet me again, though you may see them cutting me to pieces,give me no aid or succour, but leave me to my misfortune, which will notbe so great but that a greater will come to me by being helped by yourworship, on whom and all the knights-errant that have ever been born Godsend his curse.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote was getting up to chastise him, but he took to his heels atsuch a pace that no one attempted to follow him; and mightily chapfallenwas Don Quixote at Andres&rsquo; story, and the others had to take great care torestrain their laughter so as not to put him entirely out of countenance.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c31e" id="c31e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c31e.jpg (32K)" src="images/c31e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE&rsquo;S PARTY AT THE INN</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c32a" id="c32a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c32a.jpg (132K)" src="images/c32a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c32a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Their dainty repast being finished, they saddled at once, and without anyadventure worth mentioning they reached next day the inn, the object ofSancho Panza&rsquo;s fear and dread; but though he would have rather not enteredit, there was no help for it. The landlady, the landlord, their daughter,and Maritornes, when they saw Don Quixote and Sancho coming, went out towelcome them with signs of hearty satisfaction, which Don Quixote receivedwith dignity and gravity, and bade them make up a better bed for him thanthe last time: to which the landlady replied that if he paid better thanhe did the last time she would give him one fit for a prince. Don Quixotesaid he would, so they made up a tolerable one for him in the same garretas before; and he lay down at once, being sorely shaken and in want ofsleep.</p><p>No sooner was the door shut upon him than the landlady made at the barber,and seizing him by the beard, said:</p><p>&ldquo;By my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer; youmust give me back my tail, for it is a shame the way that thing of myhusband&rsquo;s goes tossing about on the floor; I mean the comb that I used tostick in my good tail.&rdquo;</p><p>But for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until thelicentiate told him to let her have it, as there was now no further occasionfor that stratagem, because he might declare himself and appear in his owncharacter, and tell Don Quixote that he had fled to this inn when those thievesthe galley slaves robbed him; and should he ask for the princess&rsquo;ssquire, they could tell him that she had sent him on before her to give noticeto the people of her kingdom that she was coming, and bringing with her thedeliverer of them all. On this the barber cheerfully restored the tail to thelandlady, and at the same time they returned all the accessories they hadborrowed to effect Don Quixote&rsquo;s deliverance. All the people of the innwere struck with astonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, and even at the comelyfigure of the shepherd Cardenio. The curate made them get ready such fare asthere was in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of better payment, served themup a tolerably good dinner. All this time Don Quixote was asleep, and theythought it best not to waken him, as sleeping would now do him more good thaneating.</p><p>While at dinner, the company consisting of the landlord, his wife, theirdaughter, Maritornes, and all the travellers, they discussed the strangecraze of Don Quixote and the manner in which he had been found; and thelandlady told them what had taken place between him and the carrier; andthen, looking round to see if Sancho was there, when she saw he was not,she gave them the whole story of his blanketing, which they received withno little amusement. But on the curate observing that it was the books ofchivalry which Don Quixote had read that had turned his brain, thelandlord said:</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot understand how that can be, for in truth to my mind there is nobetter reading in the world, and I have here two or three of them, withother writings that are the very life, not only of myself but of plentymore; for when it is harvest-time, the reapers flock here on holidays, andthere is always one among them who can read and who takes up one of thesebooks, and we gather round him, thirty or more of us, and stay listeningto him with a delight that makes our grey hairs grow young again. At leastI can say for myself that when I hear of what furious and terrible blowsthe knights deliver, I am seized with the longing to do the same, and Iwould like to be hearing about them night and day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I just as much,&rdquo; said the landlady, &ldquo;because I never have a quietmoment in my house except when you are listening to someone reading; forthen you are so taken up that for the time being you forget to scold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Maritornes; &ldquo;and, faith, I relish hearing thesethings greatly too, for they are very pretty; especially when theydescribe some lady or another in the arms of her knight under the orangetrees, and the duenna who is keeping watch for them half dead with envyand fright; all this I say is as good as honey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you, what do you think, young lady?&rdquo; said the curate turning to thelandlord&rsquo;s daughter.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know indeed, señor,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I listen too, and to tell thetruth, though I do not understand it, I like hearing it; but it is not theblows that my father likes that I like, but the laments the knights utterwhen they are separated from their ladies; and indeed they sometimes makeme weep with the pity I feel for them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you would console them if it was for you they wept, young lady?&rdquo;said Dorothea.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I should do,&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;I only know that thereare some of those ladies so cruel that they call their knights tigers andlions and a thousand other foul names: and Jesus! I don&rsquo;t know what sortof folk they can be, so unfeeling and heartless, that rather than bestow aglance upon a worthy man they leave him to die or go mad. I don&rsquo;t knowwhat is the good of such prudery; if it is for honour&rsquo;s sake, why notmarry them? That&rsquo;s all they want.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hush, child,&rdquo; said the landlady; &ldquo;it seems to me thou knowest a greatdeal about these things, and it is not fit for girls to know or talk somuch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As the gentleman asked me, I could not help answering him,&rdquo; said thegirl.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;bring me these books, señor landlord, for Ishould like to see them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said he, and going into his own room he brought outan old valise secured with a little chain, on opening which the curatefound in it three large books and some manuscripts written in a very goodhand. The first that he opened he found to be &ldquo;Don Cirongilio of Thrace,&rdquo;and the second &ldquo;Don Felixmarte of Hircania,&rdquo; and the other the &ldquo;History ofthe Great Captain Gonzalo Hernandez de Cordova, with the Life of DiegoGarcía de Paredes.&rdquo;</p><p>When the curate read the two first titles he looked over at the barber andsaid, &ldquo;We want my friend&rsquo;s housekeeper and niece here now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;I can do just as well to carry them to the yardor to the hearth, and there is a very good fire there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! your worship would burn my books!&rdquo; said the landlord.</p><p>&ldquo;Only these two,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;Don Cirongilio, and Felixmarte.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are my books, then, heretics or phlegmatics that you want to burnthem?&rdquo; said the landlord.</p><p>&ldquo;Schismatics you mean, friend,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;not phlegmatics.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;but if you want to burn any, let it bethat about the Great Captain and that Diego García; for I would ratherhave a child of mine burnt than either of the others.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;those two books are made up of lies, and arefull of folly and nonsense; but this of the Great Captain is a truehistory, and contains the deeds of Gonzalo Hernandez of Cordova, who byhis many and great achievements earned the title all over the world of theGreat Captain, a famous and illustrious name, and deserved by him alone;and this Diego García de Paredes was a distinguished knight of the city ofTrujillo in Estremadura, a most gallant soldier, and of such bodilystrength that with one finger he stopped a mill-wheel in full motion; andposted with a two-handed sword at the foot of a bridge he kept the wholeof an immense army from passing over it, and achieved such other exploitsthat if, instead of his relating them himself with the modesty of a knightand of one writing his own history, some free and unbiased writer hadrecorded them, they would have thrown into the shade all the deeds of theHectors, Achilleses, and Rolands.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c32b" id="c32b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c32b.jpg (395K)" src="images/c32b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c32b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Tell that to my father,&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a thing to beastonished at!

It is a good joke for your worship totry and persuade me that everything these good books say is nonsense andlies, and they printed by the license of the Lords of the Royal Council,as if they were people who would allow such a lot of lies to be printedall together, and so many battles and enchantments that they take awayone&rsquo;s senses.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have told you, friend,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;that this is done to divertour idle thoughts; and as in well-ordered states games of chess, fives,and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not care, orare not obliged, or are unable to work, so books of this kind are allowedto be printed, on the supposition that, what indeed is the truth, therecan be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true stories; and ifit were permitted me now, and the present company desired it, I could saysomething about the qualities books of chivalry should possess to be goodones, that would be to the advantage and even to the taste of some; but Ihope the time will come when I can communicate my ideas to someone whomay be able to mend matters; and in the meantime, señor landlord, believewhat I have said, and take your books, and make up your mind about theirtruth or falsehood, and much good may they do you; and God grant you maynot fall lame of the same foot your guest Don Quixote halts on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No fear of that,&rdquo; returned the landlord; &ldquo;I shall not be so mad as tomake a knight-errant of myself; for I see well enough that things are notnow as they used to be in those days, when they say those famous knightsroamed about the world.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho had made his appearance in the middle of this conversation, and hewas very much troubled and cast down by what he heard said aboutknights-errant being now no longer in vogue, and all books of chivalrybeing folly and lies; and he resolved in his heart to wait and see whatcame of this journey of his master&rsquo;s, and if it did not turn out ashappily as his master expected, he determined to leave him and go back tohis wife and children and his ordinary labour.</p><p>The landlord was carrying away the valise and the books, but the curatesaid to him, &ldquo;Wait; I want to see what those papers are that are writtenin such a good hand.&rdquo; The landlord taking them out handed them to him toread, and he perceived they were a work of about eight sheets ofmanuscript, with, in large letters at the beginning, the title of &ldquo;Novelof the Ill-advised Curiosity.&rdquo; The curate read three or four lines tohimself, and said, &ldquo;I must say the title of this novel does not seem to mea bad one, and I feel an inclination to read it all.&rdquo; To which thelandlord replied, &ldquo;Then your reverence will do well to read it, for I cantell you that some guests who have read it here have been much pleasedwith it, and have begged it of me very earnestly; but I would not give it,meaning to return it to the person who forgot the valise, books, andpapers here, for maybe he will return here some time or other; and thoughI know I shall miss the books, faith I mean to return them;

replied the host.</p><p>While they were talking Cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to readit, and forming the same opinion of it as the curate, he begged him toread it so that they might all hear it.</p><p>&ldquo;I would read it,&rdquo;

They were unmarried, young, ofthe same age and of the same tastes, which was enough to account for thereciprocal friendship between them. Anselmo, it is true, was somewhat moreinclined to seek pleasure in love than Lothario, for whom the pleasures ofthe chase had more attraction; but on occasion Anselmo would forego hisown tastes to yield to those of Lothario, and Lothario would surrender histo fall in with those of Anselmo, and in this way their inclinations keptpace one with the other with a concord so perfect that the best regulatedclock could not surpass it.</p><p>Anselmo was deep in love with a high-born and beautiful maiden of the samecity, the daughter of parents so estimable, and so estimable herself, thathe resolved, with the approval of his friend Lothario, without whom he didnothing, to ask her of them in marriage, and did so, Lothario being thebearer of the demand, and conducting the negotiation so much to thesatisfaction of his friend that in a short time he was in possession ofthe object of his desires, and Camilla so happy in having won Anselmo forher husband, that she gave thanks unceasingly to heaven and to Lothario,by whose means such good fortune had fallen to her. The first few days,those of a wedding being usually days of merry-making, Lothario frequentedhis friend Anselmo&rsquo;s house as he had been wont, striving to do honour tohim and to the occasion, and to gratify him in every way he could; butwhen the wedding days were over and the succession of visits andcongratulations had slackened, he began purposely to leave off going tothe house of Anselmo, for it seemed to him, as it naturally would to allmen of sense, that friends&rsquo; houses ought not to be visited after marriagewith the same frequency as in their masters&rsquo; bachelor days: because,though true and genuine friendship cannot and should not be in any waysuspicious, still a married man&rsquo;s honour is a thing of such delicacy thatit is held liable to injury from brothers, much more from friends. Anselmoremarked the cessation of Lothario&rsquo;s visits, and complained of it to him,saying that if he had known that marriage was to keep him from enjoyinghis society as he used, he would have never married; and that, if by thethorough harmony that subsisted between them while he was a bachelor theyhad earned such a sweet name as that of &ldquo;The Two Friends,&rdquo; he should notallow a title so rare and so delightful to be lost through a needlessanxiety to act circumspectly; and so he entreated him, if such a phrasewas allowable between them, to be once more master of his house and tocome in and go out as formerly, assuring him that his wife Camilla had noother desire or inclination than that which he would wish her to have, andthat knowing how sincerely they loved one another she was grieved to seesuch coldness in him.</p><p>To all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade him tocome to his house as he had been in the habit of doing, Lothario repliedwith so much prudence, sense, and judgment, that Anselmo was satisfied ofhis friend&rsquo;s good intentions, and it was agreed that on two days in theweek, and on holidays, Lothario should come to dine with him; but thoughthis arrangement was made between them Lothario resolved to observe it nofurther than he considered to be in accordance with the honour of hisfriend, whose good name was more to him than his own. He said, and justly,that a married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife shouldconsider as carefully what friends he brought to his house as what femalefriends his wife associated with, for what cannot be done or arranged inthe market-place, in church, at public festivals or at stations(opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives), may beeasily managed in the house of the female friend or relative in whom mostconfidence is reposed. Lothario said, too, that every married man shouldhave some friend who would point out to him any negligence he might beguilty of in his conduct, for it will sometimes happen that owing to thedeep affection the husband bears his wife either he does not caution her,or, not to vex her, refrains from telling her to do or not to do certainthings, doing or avoiding which may be a matter of honour or reproach tohim; and errors of this kind he could easily correct if warned by afriend. But where is such a friend to be found as Lothario would have, sojudicious, so loyal, and so true?</p><p>Of a truth I know not; Lothario alone was such a one, for with the utmostcare and vigilance he watched over the honour of his friend, and strove todiminish, cut down, and reduce the number of days for going to his houseaccording to their agreement, lest the visits of a young man, wealthy,high-born, and with the attractions he was conscious of possessing, at thehouse of a woman so beautiful as Camilla, should be regarded withsuspicion by the inquisitive and malicious eyes of the idle public. Forthough his integrity and reputation might bridle slanderous tongues, stillhe was unwilling to hazard either his own good name or that of his friend;and for this reason most of the days agreed upon he devoted to some otherbusiness which he pretended was unavoidable; so that a great portion ofthe day was taken up with complaints on one side and excuses on the other.It happened, however, that on one occasion when the two were strollingtogether outside the city, Anselmo addressed the following words toLothario.</p><p>&ldquo;Thou mayest suppose, Lothario my friend, that I am unable to givesufficient thanks for the favours God has rendered me in making me the sonof such parents as mine were, and bestowing upon me with no niggard handwhat are called the gifts of nature as well as those of fortune, and aboveall for what he has done in giving me thee for a friend and Camilla for awife&mdash;two treasures that I value, if not as highly as I ought, atleast as highly as I am able. And yet, with all these good things, whichare commonly all that men need to enable them to live happily, I am themost discontented and dissatisfied man in the whole world; for, I know nothow long since, I have been harassed and oppressed by a desire so strangeand so unusual, that I wonder at myself and blame and chide myself when Iam alone, and strive to stifle it and hide it from my own thoughts, andwith no better success than if I were endeavouring deliberately to publishit to all the world; and as, in short, it must come out, I would confideit to thy safe keeping, feeling sure that by this means, and by thyreadiness as a true friend to afford me relief, I shall soon find myselffreed from the distress it causes me, and that thy care will give mehappiness in the same degree as my own folly has caused me misery.&rdquo;</p><p>The words of Anselmo struck Lothario with astonishment, unable as he wasto conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble; and though he stroveto imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his friend, hisconjectures were all far from the truth, and to relieve the anxiety whichthis perplexity was causing him, he told him he was doing a flagrantinjustice to their great friendship in seeking circuitous methods ofconfiding to him his most hidden thoughts, for he well knew he mightreckon upon his counsel in diverting them, or his help in carrying theminto effect.</p><p>&ldquo;That is the truth,&rdquo; replied Anselmo, &ldquo;and relying upon that I will tellthee, friend Lothario, that the desire which harasses me is that ofknowing whether my wife Camilla is as good and as perfect as I think herto be; and I cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this point except bytesting her in such a way that the trial may prove the purity of hervirtue as the fire proves that of gold; because I am persuaded, my friend,that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she is or is not tempted;and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the promises, gifts,tears, and importunities of earnest lovers; for what thanks does a womandeserve for being good if no one urges her to be bad, and what wonder isit that she is reserved and circumspect to whom no opportunity is given ofgoing wrong and who knows she has a husband that will take her life thefirst time he detects her in an impropriety? I do not therefore hold herwho is virtuous through fear or want of opportunity in the same estimationas her who comes out of temptation and trial with a crown of victory; andso, for these reasons and many others that I could give thee to justifyand support the opinion I hold, I am desirous that my wife Camilla shouldpass this crisis, and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herselfwooed and by one worthy to set his affections upon her; and if she comesout, as I know she will, victorious from this struggle, I shall look uponmy good fortune as unequalled, I shall be able to say that the cup of mydesire is full, and that the virtuous woman of whom the sage says &lsquo;Whoshall find her?&rsquo; has fallen to my lot. And if the result be the contraryof what I expect, in the satisfaction of knowing that I have been right inmy opinion, I shall bear without complaint the pain which my so dearlybought experience will naturally cause me. And, as nothing of all thouwilt urge in opposition to my wish will avail to keep me from carrying itinto effect, it is my desire, friend Lothario, that thou shouldst consentto become the instrument for effecting this purpose that I am bent upon,for I will afford thee opportunities to that end, and nothing shall bewanting that I may think necessary for the pursuit of a virtuous,honourable, modest and high-minded woman. And among other reasons, I aminduced to entrust this arduous task to thee by the consideration that ifCamilla be conquered by thee the conquest will not be pushed to extremes,but only far enough to account that accomplished which from a sense ofhonour will be left undone; thus I shall not be wronged in anything morethan intention, and my wrong will remain buried in the integrity of thysilence, which I know well will be as lasting as that of death in whatconcerns me. If, therefore, thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be calledlife, thou wilt at once engage in this love struggle, not lukewarmly norslothfully, but with the energy and zeal that my desire demands, and withthe loyalty our friendship assures me of.&rdquo;</p><p>Such were the words Anselmo addressed to Lothario, who listened to them withsuch attention that, except to say what has been already mentioned, he did notopen his lips until the other had finished. Then perceiving that he had no moreto say, after regarding him for a while, as one would regard something neverbefore seen that excited wonder and amazement, he said to him, &ldquo;I cannotpersuade myself, Anselmo my friend, that what thou hast said to me is not injest; if I thought that thou wert speaking seriously I would not have allowedthee to go so far; so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not listening tothee I verily suspect that either thou dost not know me, or I do not know thee;but no, I know well thou art Anselmo, and thou knowest that I am Lothario; themisfortune is, it seems to me, that thou art not the Anselmo thou wert, andmust have thought that I am not the Lothario I should be; for the things thatthou hast said to me are not those of that Anselmo who was my friend, nor arethose that thou demandest of me what should be asked of the Lothario thouknowest. True friends will prove their friends and make use of them, as a poethas said, <i>usque ad aras;</i> whereby he meant that they will not make use oftheir friendship in things that are contrary to God&rsquo;s will. If this,then, was a heathen&rsquo;s feeling about friendship, how much more should itbe a Christian&rsquo;s, who knows that the divine must not be forfeited for thesake of any human friendship? And if a friend should go so far as to put asidehis duty to Heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend, it should not be inmatters that are trifling or of little moment, but in such as affect thefriend&rsquo;s life and honour. Now tell me, Anselmo, in which of these two artthou imperilled, that I should hazard myself to gratify thee, and do a thing sodetestable as that thou seekest of me? Neither forsooth; on the contrary, thoudost ask of me, so far as I understand, to strive and labour to rob thee ofhonour and life, and to rob myself of them at the same time; for if I take awaythy honour it is plain I take away thy life, as a man without honour is worsethan dead; and being the instrument, as thou wilt have it so, of so much wrongto thee, shall not I, too, be left without honour, and consequently withoutlife? Listen to me, Anselmo my friend, and be not impatient to answer me untilI have said what occurs to me touching the object of thy desire, for there willbe time enough left for thee to reply and for me to hear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said Anselmo, &ldquo;say what thou wilt.&rdquo;</p><p>Lothario then went on to say, &ldquo;It seems to me, Anselmo, that thine isjust now the temper of mind which is always that of the Moors, who can never bebrought to see the error of their creed by quotations from the Holy Scriptures,or by reasons which depend upon the examination of the understanding or arefounded upon the articles of faith, but must have examples that are palpable,easy, intelligible, capable of proof, not admitting of doubt, with mathematicaldemonstrations that cannot be denied, like, &lsquo;<i>If equals be taken fromequals, the remainders are equal:</i>&rsquo; and if they do not understand thisin words, and indeed they do not, it has to be shown to them with the hands,and put before their eyes, and even with all this no one succeeds in convincingthem of the truth of our holy religion. This same mode of proceeding I shallhave to adopt with thee, for the desire which has sprung up in thee is soabsurd and remote from everything that has a semblance of reason, that I feelit would be a waste of time to employ it in reasoning with thy simplicity, forat present I will call it by no other name; and I am even tempted to leave theein thy folly as a punishment for thy pernicious desire; but the friendship Ibear thee, which will not allow me to desert thee in such manifest danger ofdestruction, keeps me from dealing so harshly by thee. And that thou mayestclearly see this, say, Anselmo, hast thou not told me that I must force my suitupon a modest woman, decoy one that is virtuous, make overtures to one that ispure-minded, pay court to one that is prudent? Yes, thou hast told me so. Then,if thou knowest that thou hast a wife, modest, virtuous, pure-minded andprudent, what is it that thou seekest? And if thou believest that she will comeforth victorious from all my attacks&mdash;as doubtless she would&mdash;whathigher titles than those she possesses now dost thou think thou canst bestowupon her then, or in what will she be better then than she is now? Either thoudost not hold her to be what thou sayest, or thou knowest not what thou dostdemand. If thou dost not hold her to be what thou sayest, why dost thou seek toprove her instead of treating her as guilty in the way that may seem best tothee? but if she be as virtuous as thou believest, it is an uncalled-forproceeding to make trial of truth itself, for, after trial, it will but be inthe same estimation as before. Thus, then, it is conclusive that to attemptthings from which harm rather than advantage may come to us is the part ofunreasoning and reckless minds, more especially when they are things which weare not forced or compelled to attempt, and which show from afar that it isplainly madness to attempt them.</p><p>&ldquo;Difficulties are attempted either for the sake of God or for the sake ofthe world, or for both; those undertaken for God&rsquo;s sake are those whichthe saints undertake when they attempt to live the lives of angels inhuman bodies; those undertaken for the sake of the world are those of themen who traverse such a vast expanse of water, such a variety of climates,so many strange countries, to acquire what are called the blessings offortune; and those undertaken for the sake of God and the world togetherare those of brave soldiers, who no sooner do they see in the enemy&rsquo;s walla breach as wide as a cannon ball could make, than, casting aside allfear, without hesitating, or heeding the manifest peril that threatensthem, borne onward by the desire of defending their faith, their country,and their king, they fling themselves dauntlessly into the midst of thethousand opposing deaths that await them. Such are the things that men arewont to attempt, and there is honour, glory, gain, in attempting them,however full of difficulty and peril they may be; but that which thousayest it is thy wish to attempt and carry out will not win thee the gloryof God nor the blessings of fortune nor fame among men; for even if theissue be as thou wouldst have it, thou wilt be no happier, richer, or morehonoured than thou art this moment; and if it be otherwise thou wilt bereduced to misery greater than can be imagined, for then it will availthee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of the misfortune that hasbefallen thee; it will suffice to torture and crush thee that thou knowestit thyself. And in confirmation of the truth of what I say, let me repeatto thee a stanza made by the famous poet Luigi Tansillo at the end of thefirst part of his &lsquo;Tears of Saint Peter,&rsquo; which says thus:</p><p class="poem">The anguish and the shame but greater grew<br/>    In Peter&rsquo;s heart as morning slowly came;<br/>No eye was there to see him, well he knew,<br/>    Yet he himself was to himself a shame;<br/>Exposed to all men&rsquo;s gaze, or screened from view,<br/>    A noble heart will feel the pang the same;<br/>A prey to shame the sinning soul will be,<br/>Though none but heaven and earth its shame can see.</p><p>Thus by keeping it secret thou wilt not escape thy sorrow, but rather thouwilt shed tears unceasingly, if not tears of the eyes, tears of blood fromthe heart, like those shed by that simple doctor our poet tells us of,that tried the test of the cup, which the wise Rinaldo, better advised,refused to do; for though this may be a poetic fiction it contains a morallesson worthy of attention and study and imitation. Moreover by what I amabout to say to thee thou wilt be led to see the great error thou wouldstcommit.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, Anselmo, if Heaven or good fortune had made thee master andlawful owner of a diamond of the finest quality, with the excellence andpurity of which all the lapidaries that had seen it had been satisfied,saying with one voice and common consent that in purity, quality, andfineness, it was all that a stone of the kind could possibly be, thouthyself too being of the same belief, as knowing nothing to the contrary,would it be reasonable in thee to desire to take that diamond and place itbetween an anvil and a hammer, and by mere force of blows and strength ofarm try if it were as hard and as fine as they said? And if thou didst,and if the stone should resist so silly a test, that would add nothing toits value or reputation; and if it were broken, as it might be, would notall be lost? Undoubtedly it would, leaving its owner to be rated as a foolin the opinion of all. Consider, then, Anselmo my friend, that Camilla isa diamond of the finest quality as well in thy estimation as in that ofothers, and that it is contrary to reason to expose her to the risk ofbeing broken; for if she remains intact she cannot rise to a higher valuethan she now possesses; and if she give way and be unable to resist,bethink thee now how thou wilt be deprived of her, and with what goodreason thou wilt complain of thyself for having been the cause of her ruinand thine own. Remember there is no jewel in the world so precious as achaste and virtuous woman, and that the whole honour of women consists inreputation; and since thy wife&rsquo;s is of that high excellence that thouknowest, wherefore shouldst thou seek to call that truth in question?Remember, my friend, that woman is an imperfect animal, and thatimpediments are not to be placed in her way to make her trip and fall, butthat they should be removed, and her path left clear of all obstacles, sothat without hindrance she may run her course freely to attain the desiredperfection, which consists in being virtuous. Naturalists tell us that theermine is a little animal which has a fur of purest white, and that whenthe hunters wish to take it, they make use of this artifice. Havingascertained the places which it frequents and passes, they stop the way tothem with mud, and then rousing it, drive it towards the spot, and as soonas the ermine comes to the mud it halts, and allows itself to be takencaptive rather than pass through the mire, and spoil and sully itswhiteness, which it values more than life and liberty. The virtuous andchaste woman is an ermine, and whiter and purer than snow is the virtue ofmodesty; and he who wishes her not to lose it, but to keep and preserveit, must adopt a course different from that employed with the ermine; hemust not put before her the mire of the gifts and attentions ofpersevering lovers, because perhaps&mdash;and even without a perhaps&mdash;shemay not have sufficient virtue and natural strength in herself to passthrough and tread under foot these impediments; they must be removed, andthe brightness of virtue and the beauty of a fair fame must be put beforeher. A virtuous woman, too, is like a mirror, of clear shining crystal,liable to be tarnished and dimmed by every breath that touches it. Shemust be treated as relics are; adored, not touched. She must be protectedand prized as one protects and prizes a fair garden full of roses andflowers, the owner of which allows no one to trespass or pluck a blossom;enough for others that from afar and through the iron grating they mayenjoy its fragrance and its beauty. Finally let me repeat to thee someverses that come to my mind; I heard them in a modern comedy, and it seemsto me they bear upon the point we are discussing. A prudent old man wasgiving advice to another, the father of a young girl, to lock her up,watch over her and keep her in seclusion, and among other arguments heused these:</p><p class="poem">Woman is a thing of glass;<br/>    But her brittleness &rsquo;tis best<br/>    Not too curiously to test:<br/>Who knows what may come to pass?<br/><br/>Breaking is an easy matter,<br/>    And it&rsquo;s folly to expose<br/>    What you cannot mend to blows;<br/>What you can&rsquo;t make whole to shatter.<br/><br/>This, then, all may hold as true,<br/>    And the reason&rsquo;s plain to see;<br/>    For if Danaës there be,<br/>There are golden showers too.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;All that I have said to thee so far, Anselmo, has had reference to whatconcerns thee; now it is right that I should say something of what regardsmyself; and if I be prolix, pardon me, for the labyrinth into which thouhast entered and from which thou wouldst have me extricate thee makes itnecessary.</p><p>&ldquo;Thou dost reckon me thy friend, and thou wouldst rob me of honour, athing wholly inconsistent with friendship; and not only dost thou aim atthis, but thou wouldst have me rob thee of it also. That thou wouldst robme of it is clear, for when Camilla sees that I pay court to her as thourequirest, she will certainly regard me as a man without honour or rightfeeling, since I attempt and do a thing so much opposed to what I owe tomy own position and thy friendship. That thou wouldst have me rob thee ofit is beyond a doubt, for Camilla, seeing that I press my suit upon her,will suppose that I have perceived in her something light that hasencouraged me to make known to her my base desire; and if she holdsherself dishonoured, her dishonour touches thee as belonging to her; andhence arises what so commonly takes place, that the husband of theadulterous woman, though he may not be aware of or have given any causefor his wife&rsquo;s failure in her duty, or (being careless or negligent) havehad it in his power to prevent his dishonour, nevertheless is stigmatisedby a vile and reproachful name, and in a manner regarded with eyes ofcontempt instead of pity by all who know of his wife&rsquo;s guilt, though theysee that he is unfortunate not by his own fault, but by the lust of avicious consort. But I will tell thee why with good reason dishonourattaches to the husband of the unchaste wife, though he know not that sheis so, nor be to blame, nor have done anything, or given any provocationto make her so; and be not weary with listening to me, for it will be forthy good.</p><p>&ldquo;When God created our first parent in the earthly paradise, the HolyScripture says that he infused sleep into Adam and while he slept took arib from his left side of which he formed our mother Eve, and when Adamawoke and beheld her he said, &lsquo;This is flesh of my flesh, and bone of mybone.&rsquo; And God said &lsquo;For this shall a man leave his father and his mother,and they shall be two in one flesh; and then was instituted the divinesacrament of marriage, with such ties that death alone can loose them. Andsuch is the force and virtue of this miraculous sacrament that it makestwo different persons one and the same flesh; and even more than this whenthe virtuous are married; for though they have two souls they have but onewill. And hence it follows that as the flesh of the wife is one and thesame with that of her husband the stains that may come upon it, or theinjuries it incurs fall upon the husband&rsquo;s flesh, though he, as has beensaid, may have given no cause for them; for as the pain of the foot or anymember of the body is felt by the whole body, because all is one flesh, asthe head feels the hurt to the ankle without having caused it, so thehusband, being one with her, shares the dishonour of the wife; and as allworldly honour or dishonour comes of flesh and blood, and the erringwife&rsquo;s is of that kind, the husband must needs bear his part of it and beheld dishonoured without knowing it. See, then, Anselmo, the peril thouart encountering in seeking to disturb the peace of thy virtuous consort;see for what an empty and ill-advised curiosity thou wouldst rouse uppassions that now repose in quiet in the breast of thy chaste wife;reflect that what thou art staking all to win is little, and what thouwilt lose so much that I leave it undescribed, not having the words toexpress it. But if all I have said be not enough to turn thee from thyvile purpose, thou must seek some other instrument for thy dishonour andmisfortune; for such I will not consent to be, though I lose thyfriendship, the greatest loss that I can conceive.&rdquo;</p><p>Having said this, the wise and virtuous Lothario was silent, and Anselmo,troubled in mind and deep in thought, was unable for a while to utter aword in reply; but at length he said, &ldquo;I have listened, Lothario myfriend, attentively, as thou hast seen, to what thou hast chosen to say tome, and in thy arguments, examples, and comparisons I have seen that highintelligence thou dost possess, and the perfection of true friendship thouhast reached; and likewise I see and confess that if I am not guided bythy opinion, but follow my own, I am flying from the good and pursuing theevil. This being so, thou must remember that I am now labouring under thatinfirmity which women sometimes suffer from, when the craving seizes themto eat clay, plaster, charcoal, and things even worse, disgusting to lookat, much more to eat; so that it will be necessary to have recourse tosome artifice to cure me; and this can be easily effected if only thouwilt make a beginning, even though it be in a lukewarm and make-believefashion, to pay court to Camilla, who will not be so yielding that hervirtue will give way at the first attack: with this mere attempt I shallrest satisfied, and thou wilt have done what our friendship binds thee todo, not only in giving me life, but in persuading me not to discard myhonour. And this thou art bound to do for one reason alone, that, being,as I am, resolved to apply this test, it is not for thee to permit me toreveal my weakness to another, and so imperil that honour thou artstriving to keep me from losing; and if thine may not stand as high as itought in the estimation of Camilla while thou art paying court to her,that is of little or no importance, because ere long, on finding in herthat constancy which we expect, thou canst tell her the plain truth asregards our stratagem, and so regain thy place in her esteem; and as thouart venturing so little, and by the venture canst afford me so muchsatisfaction, refuse not to undertake it, even if further difficultiespresent themselves to thee; for, as I have said, if thou wilt only make abeginning I will acknowledge the issue decided.&rdquo;</p><p>Lothario seeing the fixed determination of Anselmo, and not knowing whatfurther examples to offer or arguments to urge in order to dissuade himfrom it, and perceiving that he threatened to confide his perniciousscheme to someone else, to avoid a greater evil resolved to gratify himand do what he asked, intending to manage the business so as to satisfyAnselmo without corrupting the mind of Camilla; so in reply he told himnot to communicate his purpose to any other, for he would undertake thetask himself, and would begin it as soon as he pleased. Anselmo embracedhim warmly and affectionately, and thanked him for his offer as if he hadbestowed some great favour upon him; and it was agreed between them to setabout it the next day, Anselmo affording opportunity and time to Lotharioto converse alone with Camilla, and furnishing him with money and jewelsto offer and present to her. He suggested, too, that he should treat herto music, and write verses in her praise, and if he was unwilling to takethe trouble of composing them, he offered to do it himself. Lotharioagreed to all with an intention very different from what Anselmo supposed,and with this understanding they returned to Anselmo&rsquo;s house, where theyfound Camilla awaiting her husband anxiously and uneasily, for he waslater than usual in returning that day. Lothario repaired to his ownhouse, and Anselmo remained in his, as well satisfied as Lothario wastroubled in mind; for he could see no satisfactory way out of thisill-advised business. That night, however, he thought of a plan by whichhe might deceive Anselmo without any injury to Camilla. The next day hewent to dine with his friend, and was welcomed by Camilla, who receivedand treated him with great cordiality, knowing the affection her husbandfelt for him. When dinner was over and the cloth removed, Anselmo toldLothario to stay there with Camilla while he attended to some pressingbusiness, as he would return in an hour and a half. Camilla begged him notto go, and Lothario offered to accompany him, but nothing could persuadeAnselmo, who on the contrary pressed Lothario to remain waiting for him ashe had a matter of great importance to discuss with him. At the same timehe bade Camilla not to leave Lothario alone until he came back. In shorthe contrived to put so good a face on the reason, or the folly, of hisabsence that no one could have suspected it was a pretence.</p><p>Anselmo took his departure, and Camilla and Lothario were left alone atthe table, for the rest of the household had gone to dinner. Lothario sawhimself in the lists according to his friend&rsquo;s wish, and facing an enemythat could by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron of armed knights; judgewhether he had good reason to fear; but what he did was to lean his elbowon the arm of the chair, and his cheek upon his hand, and, askingCamilla&rsquo;s pardon for his ill manners, he said he wished to take a littlesleep until Anselmo returned. Camilla in reply said he could repose moreat his ease in the reception-room than in his chair, and begged of him togo in and sleep there; but Lothario declined, and there he remained asleepuntil the return of Anselmo, who finding Camilla in her own room, andLothario asleep, imagined that he had stayed away so long as to haveafforded them time enough for conversation and even for sleep, and was allimpatience until Lothario should wake up, that he might go out with himand question him as to his success. Everything fell out as he wished;Lothario awoke, and the two at once left the house, and Anselmo asked whathe was anxious to know, and Lothario in answer told him that he had notthought it advisable to declare himself entirely the first time, andtherefore had only extolled the charms of Camilla, telling her that allthe city spoke of nothing else but her beauty and wit, for this seemed tohim an excellent way of beginning to gain her good-will and render herdisposed to listen to him with pleasure the next time, thus availinghimself of the device the devil has recourse to when he would deceive onewho is on the watch; for he being the angel of darkness transforms himselfinto an angel of light, and, under cover of a fair seeming, discloseshimself at length, and effects his purpose if at the beginning his wilesare not discovered. All this gave great satisfaction to Anselmo, and hesaid he would afford the same opportunity every day, but without leavingthe house, for he would find things to do at home so that Camilla shouldnot detect the plot.</p><p>Thus, then, several days went by, and Lothario, without uttering a word toCamilla, reported to Anselmo that he had talked with her and that he hadnever been able to draw from her the slightest indication of consent toanything dishonourable, nor even a sign or shadow of hope; on thecontrary, he said she would inform her husband of it.</p><p>&ldquo;So far well,&rdquo; said Anselmo; &ldquo;Camilla has thus far resisted words; we mustnow see how she will resist deeds. I will give you to-morrow two thousandcrowns in gold for you to offer or even present, and as many more to buyjewels to lure her, for women are fond of being becomingly attired andgoing gaily dressed, and all the more so if they are beautiful, howeverchaste they may be; and if she resists this temptation, I will restsatisfied and will give you no more trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>Lothario replied that now he had begun he would carry on the undertakingto the end, though he perceived he was to come out of it wearied andvanquished. The next day he received the four thousand crowns, and withthem four thousand perplexities, for he knew not what to say by way of anew falsehood; but in the end he made up his mind to tell him that Camillastood as firm against gifts and promises as against words, and that therewas no use in taking any further trouble, for the time was all spent to nopurpose.</p><p>But chance, directing things in a different manner, so ordered it thatAnselmo, having left Lothario and Camilla alone as on other occasions,shut himself into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listen throughthe keyhole to what passed between them, and perceived that for more thanhalf an hour Lothario did not utter a word to Camilla, nor would utter aword though he were to be there for an age; and he came to the conclusionthat what his friend had told him about the replies of Camilla was allinvention and falsehood, and to ascertain if it were so, he came out, andcalling Lothario aside asked him what news he had and in what humourCamilla was. Lothario replied that he was not disposed to go on with thebusiness, for she had answered him so angrily and harshly that he had noheart to say anything more to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Lothario, Lothario,&rdquo; said Anselmo, &ldquo;how ill dost thou meet thyobligations to me, and the great confidence I repose in thee! I have beenjust now watching through this keyhole, and I have seen that thou hast notsaid a word to Camilla, whence I conclude that on the former occasionsthou hast not spoken to her either, and if this be so, as no doubt it is,why dost thou deceive me, or wherefore seekest thou by craft to deprive meof the means I might find of attaining my desire?&rdquo;</p><p>Anselmo said no more, but he had said enough to cover Lothario with shameand confusion, and he, feeling as it were his honour touched by havingbeen detected in a lie, swore to Anselmo that he would from that momentdevote himself to satisfying him without any deception, as he would see ifhe had the curiosity to watch; though he need not take the trouble, forthe pains he would take to satisfy him would remove all suspicions fromhis mind. Anselmo believed him, and to afford him an opportunity more freeand less liable to surprise, he resolved to absent himself from his housefor eight days, betaking himself to that of a friend of his who lived in avillage not far from the city; and, the better to account for hisdeparture to Camilla, he so arranged it that the friend should send him avery pressing invitation.</p><p>Unhappy, shortsighted Anselmo, what art thou doing, what art thouplotting, what art thou devising? Bethink thee thou art working againstthyself, plotting thine own dishonour, devising thine own ruin. Thy wifeCamilla is virtuous, thou dost possess her in peace and quietness, no oneassails thy happiness, her thoughts wander not beyond the walls of thyhouse, thou art her heaven on earth, the object of her wishes, thefulfilment of her desires, the measure wherewith she measures her will,making it conform in all things to thine and Heaven&rsquo;s. If, then, the mineof her honour, beauty, virtue, and modesty yields thee without labour allthe wealth it contains and thou canst wish for, why wilt thou dig theearth in search of fresh veins, of new unknown treasure, risking thecollapse of all, since it but rests on the feeble props of her weaknature? Bethink thee that from him who seeks impossibilities that which ispossible may with justice be withheld, as was better expressed by a poetwho said:</p><p class="poem">&rsquo;Tis mine to seek for life in death,<br/>    Health in disease seek I,<br/>I seek in prison freedom&rsquo;s breath,<br/>    In traitors loyalty.<br/><br/>So Fate that ever scorns to grant<br/>    Or grace or boon to me,<br/>Since what can never be I want,<br/>    Denies me what might be.<br/></p><p>The next day Anselmo took his departure for the village, leavinginstructions with Camilla that during his absence Lothario would come tolook after his house and to dine with her, and that she was to treat himas she would himself. Camilla was distressed, as a discreet andright-minded woman would be, at the orders her husband left her, and badehim remember that it was not becoming that anyone should occupy his seatat the table during his absence, and if he acted thus from not feelingconfidence that she would be able to manage his house, let him try herthis time, and he would find by experience that she was equal to greaterresponsibilities. Anselmo replied that it was his pleasure to have it so,and that she had only to submit and obey. Camilla said she would do so,though against her will.</p><p>Anselmo went, and the next day Lothario came to his house, where he wasreceived by Camilla with a friendly and modest welcome; but she neversuffered Lothario to see her alone, for she was always attended by her menand women servants, especially by a handmaid of hers, Leonela by name, towhom she was much attached (for they had been brought up together fromchildhood in her father&rsquo;s house), and whom she had kept with her after hermarriage with Anselmo. The first three days Lothario did not speak to her,though he might have done so when they removed the cloth and the servantsretired to dine hastily; for such were Camilla&rsquo;s orders; nay more, Leonelahad directions to dine earlier than Camilla and never to leave her side.She, however, having her thoughts fixed upon other things more to hertaste, and wanting that time and opportunity for her own pleasures, didnot always obey her mistress&rsquo;s commands, but on the contrary left themalone, as if they had ordered her to do so; but the modest bearing ofCamilla, the calmness of her countenance, the composure of her aspect wereenough to bridle the tongue of Lothario. But the influence which the manyvirtues of Camilla exerted in imposing silence on Lothario&rsquo;s tongue provedmischievous for both of them, for if his tongue was silent his thoughtswere busy, and could dwell at leisure upon the perfections of Camilla&rsquo;sgoodness and beauty one by one, charms enough to warm with love a marblestatue, not to say a heart of flesh. Lothario gazed upon her when he mighthave been speaking to her, and thought how worthy of being loved she was;and thus reflection began little by little to assail his allegiance toAnselmo, and a thousand times he thought of withdrawing from the city andgoing where Anselmo should never see him nor he see Camilla. But alreadythe delight he found in gazing on her interposed and held him fast. He puta constraint upon himself, and struggled to repel and repress the pleasurehe found in contemplating Camilla; when alone he blamed himself for hisweakness, called himself a bad friend, nay a bad Christian; then he arguedthe matter and compared himself with Anselmo; always coming to theconclusion that the folly and rashness of Anselmo had been worse than hisfaithlessness, and that if he could excuse his intentions as easily beforeGod as with man, he had no reason to fear any punishment for his offence.</p><p>In short the beauty and goodness of Camilla, joined with the opportunitywhich the blind husband had placed in his hands, overthrew the loyalty ofLothario; and giving heed to nothing save the object towards which hisinclinations led him, after Anselmo had been three days absent, duringwhich he had been carrying on a continual struggle with his passion, hebegan to make love to Camilla with so much vehemence and warmth oflanguage that she was overwhelmed with amazement, and could only rise fromher place and retire to her room without answering him a word. But thehope which always springs up with love was not weakened in Lothario bythis repelling demeanour; on the contrary his passion for Camillaincreased, and she discovering in him what she had never expected, knewnot what to do; and considering it neither safe nor right to give him thechance or opportunity of speaking to her again, she resolved to send, asshe did that very night, one of her servants with a letter to Anselmo, inwhich she addressed the following words to him.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br/>IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE NOVEL OF &ldquo;THE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY&rdquo;</h3><p>&ldquo;It is commonly said that an army looks ill without its general and acastle without its castellan, and I say that a young married woman looksstill worse without her husband unless there are very good reasons for it.I find myself so ill at ease without you, and so incapable of enduringthis separation, that unless you return quickly I shall have to go forrelief to my parents&rsquo; house, even if I leave yours without a protector;for the one you left me, if indeed he deserved that title, has, I think,more regard to his own pleasure than to what concerns you: as you arepossessed of discernment I need say no more to you, nor indeed is itfitting I should say more.&rdquo;</p><p>Anselmo received this letter, and from it he gathered that Lothario hadalready begun his task and that Camilla must have replied to him as hewould have wished; and delighted beyond measure at such intelligence hesent word to her not to leave his house on any account, as he would veryshortly return. Camilla was astonished at Anselmo&rsquo;s reply, which placedher in greater perplexity than before, for she neither dared to remain inher own house, nor yet to go to her parents&rsquo;; for in remaining her virtuewas imperilled, and in going she was opposing her husband&rsquo;s commands.Finally she decided upon what was the worse course for her, to remain,resolving not to fly from the presence of Lothario, that she might notgive food for gossip to her servants; and she now began to regret havingwritten as she had to her husband, fearing he might imagine that Lothariohad perceived in her some lightness which had impelled him to lay asidethe respect he owed her; but confident of her rectitude she put her trustin God and in her own virtuous intentions, with which she hoped to resistin silence all the solicitations of Lothario, without saying anything toher husband so as not to involve him in any quarrel or trouble; and sheeven began to consider how to excuse Lothario to Anselmo when he shouldask her what it was that induced her to write that letter. With theseresolutions, more honourable than judicious or effectual, she remained thenext day listening to Lothario, who pressed his suit so strenuously thatCamilla&rsquo;s firmness began to waver, and her virtue had enough to do to cometo the rescue of her eyes and keep them from showing signs of a certaintender compassion which the tears and appeals of Lothario had awakened inher bosom. Lothario observed all this, and it inflamed him all the more.In short he felt that while Anselmo&rsquo;s absence afforded time andopportunity he must press the siege of the fortress, and so he assailedher self-esteem with praises of her beauty, for there is nothing that morequickly reduces and levels the castle towers of fair women&rsquo;s vanity thanvanity itself upon the tongue of flattery. In fact with the utmostassiduity he undermined the rock of her purity with such engines that hadCamilla been of brass she must have fallen. He wept, he entreated, hepromised, he flattered, he importuned, he pretended with so much feelingand apparent sincerity, that he overthrew the virtuous resolves of Camillaand won the triumph he least expected and most longed for. Camillayielded, Camilla fell; but what wonder if the friendship of Lothario couldnot stand firm? A clear proof to us that the passion of love is to beconquered only by flying from it, and that no one should engage in astruggle with an enemy so mighty; for divine strength is needed toovercome his human power. Leonela alone knew of her mistress&rsquo;s weakness,for the two false friends and new lovers were unable to conceal it.Lothario did not care to tell Camilla the object Anselmo had in view, northat he had afforded him the opportunity of attaining such a result, lestshe should undervalue his love and think that it was by chance and withoutintending it and not of his own accord that he had made love to her.</p><p>A few days later Anselmo returned to his house and did not perceive whatit had lost, that which he so lightly treated and so highly prized. Hewent at once to see Lothario, and found him at home; they embraced eachother, and Anselmo asked for the tidings of his life or his death.</p><p>&ldquo;The tidings I have to give thee, Anselmo my friend,&rdquo; said Lothario, &ldquo;arethat thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the pattern and crownof all good wives. The words that I have addressed to her were borne awayon the wind, my promises have been despised, my presents have beenrefused, such feigned tears as I shed have been turned into open ridicule.In short, as Camilla is the essence of all beauty, so is she thetreasure-house where purity dwells, and gentleness and modesty abide withall the virtues that can confer praise, honour, and happiness upon awoman. Take back thy money, my friend; here it is, and I have had no needto touch it, for the chastity of Camilla yields not to things so base asgifts or promises. Be content, Anselmo, and refrain from making furtherproof; and as thou hast passed dryshod through the sea of those doubts andsuspicions that are and may be entertained of women, seek not to plungeagain into the deep ocean of new embarrassments, or with another pilotmake trial of the goodness and strength of the bark that Heaven hasgranted thee for thy passage across the sea of this world; but reckonthyself now safe in port, moor thyself with the anchor of soundreflection, and rest in peace until thou art called upon to pay that debtwhich no nobility on earth can escape paying.&rdquo;</p><p>Anselmo was completely satisfied by the words of Lothario, and believedthem as fully as if they had been spoken by an oracle; nevertheless hebegged of him not to relinquish the undertaking, were it but for the sakeof curiosity and amusement; though thenceforward he need not make use ofthe same earnest endeavours as before; all he wished him to do was towrite some verses to her, praising her under the name of Chloris, for hehimself would give her to understand that he was in love with a lady towhom he had given that name to enable him to sing her praises with thedecorum due to her modesty; and if Lothario were unwilling to take thetrouble of writing the verses he would compose them himself.</p><p>&ldquo;That will not be necessary,&rdquo; said Lothario, &ldquo;for the muses are not suchenemies of mine but that they visit me now and then in the course of theyear. Do thou tell Camilla what thou hast proposed about a pretended amourof mine; as for the verses I will make them, and if not as good as thesubject deserves, they shall be at least the best I can produce.&rdquo; Anagreement to this effect was made between the friends, the ill-advised oneand the treacherous, and Anselmo returning to his house asked Camilla thequestion she already wondered he had not asked before&mdash;what it wasthat had caused her to write the letter she had sent him. Camilla repliedthat it had seemed to her that Lothario looked at her somewhat more freelythan when he had been at home; but that now she was undeceived andbelieved it to have been only her own imagination, for Lothario nowavoided seeing her, or being alone with her. Anselmo told her she might bequite easy on the score of that suspicion, for he knew that Lothario wasin love with a damsel of rank in the city whom he celebrated under thename of Chloris, and that even if he were not, his fidelity and theirgreat friendship left no room for fear. Had not Camilla, however, beeninformed beforehand by Lothario that this love for Chloris was a pretence,and that he himself had told Anselmo of it in order to be able sometimesto give utterance to the praises of Camilla herself, no doubt she wouldhave fallen into the despairing toils of jealousy; but being forewarnedshe received the startling news without uneasiness.</p><p>The next day as the three were at table Anselmo asked Lothario to recitesomething of what he had composed for his mistress Chloris; for as Camilladid not know her, he might safely say what he liked.</p><p>&ldquo;Even did she know her,&rdquo; returned Lothario, &ldquo;I would hide nothing, forwhen a lover praises his lady&rsquo;s beauty, and charges her with cruelty, hecasts no imputation upon her fair name; at any rate, all I can say is thatyesterday I made a sonnet on the ingratitude of this Chloris, which goesthus:</p><p class="poem">SONNET<br/><br/>At midnight, in the silence, when the eyes<br/>Of happier mortals balmy slumbers close,<br/>The weary tale of my unnumbered woes<br/>To Chloris and to Heaven is wont to rise.<br/>And when the light of day returning dyes<br/>The portals of the east with tints of rose,<br/>With undiminished force my sorrow flows<br/>In broken accents and in burning sighs.<br/>And when the sun ascends his star-girt throne,<br/>And on the earth pours down his midday beams,<br/>Noon but renews my wailing and my tears;<br/>And with the night again goes up my moan.<br/>Yet ever in my agony it seems<br/>To me that neither Heaven nor Chloris hears.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>The sonnet pleased Camilla, and still more Anselmo, for he praised it andsaid the lady was excessively cruel who made no return for sincerity somanifest. On which Camilla said, &ldquo;Then all that love-smitten poets say istrue?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As poets they do not tell the truth,&rdquo; replied Lothario; &ldquo;but as loversthey are not more defective in expression than they are truthful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no doubt of that,&rdquo; observed Anselmo, anxious to support anduphold Lothario&rsquo;s ideas with Camilla, who was as regardless of his designas she was deep in love with Lothario; and so taking delight in anythingthat was his, and knowing that his thoughts and writings had her for theirobject, and that she herself was the real Chloris, she asked him to repeatsome other sonnet or verses if he recollected any.</p><p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Lothario, &ldquo;but I do not think it as good as the first one,or, more correctly speaking, less bad; but you can easily judge, for it isthis.</p><p class="poem">SONNET<br/><br/>I know that I am doomed; death is to me<br/>As certain as that thou, ungrateful fair,<br/>Dead at thy feet shouldst see me lying, ere<br/>My heart repented of its love for thee.<br/>If buried in oblivion I should be,<br/>Bereft of life, fame, favour, even there<br/>It would be found that I thy image bear<br/>Deep graven in my breast for all to see.<br/>This like some holy relic do I prize<br/>To save me from the fate my truth entails,<br/>Truth that to thy hard heart its vigour owes.<br/>Alas for him that under lowering skies,<br/>In peril o&rsquo;er a trackless ocean sails,<br/>Where neither friendly port nor pole-star shows.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>Anselmo praised this second sonnet too, as he had praised the first; andso he went on adding link after link to the chain with which he wasbinding himself and making his dishonour secure; for when Lothario wasdoing most to dishonour him he told him he was most honoured; and thuseach step that Camilla descended towards the depths of her abasement, shemounted, in his opinion, towards the summit of virtue and fair fame.</p><p>It so happened that finding herself on one occasion alone with her maid,Camilla said to her, &ldquo;I am ashamed to think, my dear Leonela, how lightlyI have valued myself that I did not compel Lothario to purchase by atleast some expenditure of time that full possession of me that I soquickly yielded him of my own free will. I fear that he will think ill ofmy pliancy or lightness, not considering the irresistible influence hebrought to bear upon me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let not that trouble you, my lady,&rdquo; said Leonela, &ldquo;for it does not takeaway the value of the thing given or make it the less precious to give itquickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized; nay, they arewont to say that he who gives quickly gives twice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They say also,&rdquo; said Camilla, &ldquo;that what costs little is valued less.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That saying does not hold good in your case,&rdquo; replied Leonela, &ldquo;for love,as I have heard say, sometimes flies and sometimes walks; with this one itruns, with that it moves slowly; some it cools, others it burns; some itwounds, others it slays; it begins the course of its desires, and at thesame moment completes and ends it; in the morning it will lay siege to afortress and by night will have taken it, for there is no power that canresist it; so what are you in dread of, what do you fear, when the samemust have befallen Lothario, love having chosen the absence of my lord asthe instrument for subduing you? and it was absolutely necessary tocomplete then what love had resolved upon, without affording the time tolet Anselmo return and by his presence compel the work to be leftunfinished; for love has no better agent for carrying out his designs thanopportunity; and of opportunity he avails himself in all his feats,especially at the outset. All this I know well myself, more by experiencethan by hearsay, and some day, señora, I will enlighten you on thesubject, for I am of your flesh and blood too. Moreover, lady Camilla, youdid not surrender yourself or yield so quickly but that first you sawLothario&rsquo;s whole soul in his eyes, in his sighs, in his words, hispromises and his gifts, and by it and his good qualities perceived howworthy he was of your love. This, then, being the case, let not thesescrupulous and prudish ideas trouble your imagination, but be assured thatLothario prizes you as you do him, and rest content and satisfied that asyou are caught in the noose of love it is one of worth and merit that hastaken you, and one that has not only the four S&rsquo;s that they say truelovers ought to have, but a complete alphabet; only listen to me and youwill see how I can repeat it by rote. He is to my eyes and thinking,Amiable, Brave, Courteous, Distinguished, Elegant, Fond, Gay, Honourable,Illustrious, Loyal, Manly, Noble, Open, Polite, Quickwitted, Rich, and theS&rsquo;s according to the saying, and then Tender, Veracious: X does not suithim, for it is a rough letter; Y has been given already; and Z Zealous foryour honour.&rdquo;</p><p>Camilla laughed at her maid&rsquo;s alphabet, and perceived her to be moreexperienced in love affairs than she said, which she admitted, confessingto Camilla that she had love passages with a young man of good birth ofthe same city. Camilla was uneasy at this, dreading lest it might provethe means of endangering her honour, and asked whether her intrigue hadgone beyond words, and she with little shame and much effrontery said ithad; for certain it is that ladies&rsquo; imprudences make servants shameless,who, when they see their mistresses make a false step, think nothing ofgoing astray themselves, or of its being known. All that Camilla could dowas to entreat Leonela to say nothing about her doings to him whom shecalled her lover, and to conduct her own affairs secretly lest they shouldcome to the knowledge of Anselmo or of Lothario. Leonela said she would,but kept her word in such a way that she confirmed Camilla&rsquo;s apprehensionof losing her reputation through her means; for this abandoned and boldLeonela, as soon as she perceived that her mistress&rsquo;s demeanour was notwhat it was wont to be, had the audacity to introduce her lover into thehouse, confident that even if her mistress saw him she would not dare toexpose him; for the sins of mistresses entail this mischief among others;they make themselves the slaves of their own servants, and are obliged tohide their laxities and depravities; as was the case with Camilla, whothough she perceived, not once but many times, that Leonela was with herlover in some room of the house, not only did not dare to chide her, butafforded her opportunities for concealing him and removed alldifficulties, lest he should be seen by her husband. She was unable,however, to prevent him from being seen on one occasion, as he salliedforth at daybreak, by Lothario, who, not knowing who he was, at first tookhim for a spectre; but, as soon as he saw him hasten away, muffling hisface with his cloak and concealing himself carefully and cautiously, herejected this foolish idea, and adopted another, which would have been theruin of all had not Camilla found a remedy. It did not occur to Lothariothat this man he had seen issuing at such an untimely hour from Anselmo&rsquo;shouse could have entered it on Leonela&rsquo;s account, nor did he even rememberthere was such a person as Leonela; all he thought was that as Camilla hadbeen light and yielding with him, so she had been with another; for thisfurther penalty the erring woman&rsquo;s sin brings with it, that her honour isdistrusted even by him to whose overtures and persuasions she has yielded;and he believes her to have surrendered more easily to others, and givesimplicit credence to every suspicion that comes into his mind. AllLothario&rsquo;s good sense seems to have failed him at this juncture; all hisprudent maxims escaped his memory; for without once reflecting rationally,and without more ado, in his impatience and in the blindness of thejealous rage that gnawed his heart, and dying to revenge himself uponCamilla, who had done him no wrong, before Anselmo had risen he hastenedto him and said to him, &ldquo;Know, Anselmo, that for several days past I havebeen struggling with myself, striving to withhold from thee what it is nolonger possible or right that I should conceal from thee. Know thatCamilla&rsquo;s fortress has surrendered and is ready to submit to my will; andif I have been slow to reveal this fact to thee, it was in order to see ifit were some light caprice of hers, or if she sought to try me andascertain if the love I began to make to her with thy permission was madewith a serious intention. I thought, too, that she, if she were what sheought to be, and what we both believed her, would have ere this given theeinformation of my addresses; but seeing that she delays, I believe thetruth of the promise she has given me that the next time thou art absentfrom the house she will grant me an interview in the closet where thyjewels are kept (and it was true that Camilla used to meet him there); butI do not wish thee to rush precipitately to take vengeance, for the sin isas yet only committed in intention, and Camilla&rsquo;s may change perhapsbetween this and the appointed time, and repentance spring up in itsplace. As hitherto thou hast always followed my advice wholly or in part,follow and observe this that I will give thee now, so that, withoutmistake, and with mature deliberation, thou mayest satisfy thyself as towhat may seem the best course; pretend to absent thyself for two or threedays as thou hast been wont to do on other occasions, and contrive to hidethyself in the closet; for the tapestries and other things there affordgreat facilities for thy concealment, and then thou wilt see with thineown eyes and I with mine what Camilla&rsquo;s purpose may be. And if it be aguilty one, which may be feared rather than expected, with silence,prudence, and discretion thou canst thyself become the instrument ofpunishment for the wrong done thee.&rdquo;</p><p>Anselmo was amazed, overwhelmed, and astounded at the words of Lothario,which came upon him at a time when he least expected to hear them, for henow looked upon Camilla as having triumphed over the pretended attacks ofLothario, and was beginning to enjoy the glory of her victory. He remainedsilent for a considerable time, looking on the ground with fixed gaze, andat length said, &ldquo;Thou hast behaved, Lothario, as I expected of thyfriendship: I will follow thy advice in everything; do as thou wilt, andkeep this secret as thou seest it should be kept in circumstances sounlooked for.&rdquo;</p><p>Lothario gave him his word, but after leaving him he repented altogetherof what he had said to him, perceiving how foolishly he had acted, as hemight have revenged himself upon Camilla in some less cruel and degradingway. He cursed his want of sense, condemned his hasty resolution, and knewnot what course to take to undo the mischief or find some ready escapefrom it. At last he decided upon revealing all to Camilla, and, as therewas no want of opportunity for doing so, he found her alone the same day;but she, as soon as she had the chance of speaking to him, said, &ldquo;Lothariomy friend, I must tell thee I have a sorrow in my heart which fills it sothat it seems ready to burst; and it will be a wonder if it does not; forthe audacity of Leonela has now reached such a pitch that every night sheconceals a gallant of hers in this house and remains with him tillmorning, at the expense of my reputation; inasmuch as it is open to anyoneto question it who may see him quitting my house at such unseasonablehours; but what distresses me is that I cannot punish or chide her, forher privity to our intrigue bridles my mouth and keeps me silent abouthers, while I am dreading that some catastrophe will come of it.&rdquo;</p><p>As Camilla said this Lothario at first imagined it was some device todelude him into the idea that the man he had seen going out was Leonela&rsquo;slover and not hers; but when he saw how she wept and suffered, and beggedhim to help her, he became convinced of the truth, and the convictioncompleted his confusion and remorse; however, he told Camilla not todistress herself, as he would take measures to put a stop to the insolenceof Leonela. At the same time he told her what, driven by the fierce rageof jealousy, he had said to Anselmo, and how he had arranged to hidehimself in the closet that he might there see plainly how little shepreserved her fidelity to him; and he entreated her pardon for thismadness, and her advice as to how to repair it, and escape safely from theintricate labyrinth in which his imprudence had involved him. Camilla wasstruck with alarm at hearing what Lothario said, and with much anger, andgreat good sense, she reproved him and rebuked his base design and thefoolish and mischievous resolution he had made; but as woman has by naturea nimbler wit than man for good and for evil, though it is apt to failwhen she sets herself deliberately to reason, Camilla on the spur of themoment thought of a way to remedy what was to all appearance irremediable,and told Lothario to contrive that the next day Anselmo should concealhimself in the place he mentioned, for she hoped from his concealment toobtain the means of their enjoying themselves for the future without anyapprehension; and without revealing her purpose to him entirely shecharged him to be careful, as soon as Anselmo was concealed, to come toher when Leonela should call him, and to all she said to him to answer ashe would have answered had he not known that Anselmo was listening.Lothario pressed her to explain her intention fully, so that he might withmore certainty and precaution take care to do what he saw to be needful.</p><p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Camilla, &ldquo;there is nothing to take care of except toanswer me what I shall ask you;&rdquo; for she did not wish to explain to himbeforehand what she meant to do, fearing lest he should be unwilling tofollow out an idea which seemed to her such a good one, and should try ordevise some other less practicable plan.</p><p>Lothario then retired, and the next day Anselmo, under pretence of goingto his friend&rsquo;s country house, took his departure, and then returned toconceal himself, which he was able to do easily, as Camilla and Leonelatook care to give him the opportunity; and so he placed himself in hidingin the state of agitation that it may be imagined he would feel whoexpected to see the vitals of his honour laid bare before his eyes, andfound himself on the point of losing the supreme blessing he thought hepossessed in his beloved Camilla. Having made sure of Anselmo&rsquo;s being inhis hiding-place, Camilla and Leonela entered the closet, and the instantshe set foot within it Camilla said, with a deep sigh, &ldquo;Ah! dear Leonela,would it not be better, before I do what I am unwilling you should knowlest you should seek to prevent it, that you should take Anselmo&rsquo;s daggerthat I have asked of you and with it pierce this vile heart of mine? Butno; there is no reason why I should suffer the punishment of another&rsquo;sfault. I will first know what it is that the bold licentious eyes ofLothario have seen in me that could have encouraged him to reveal to me adesign so base as that which he has disclosed regardless of his friend andof my honour. Go to the window, Leonela, and call him, for no doubt he isin the street waiting to carry out his vile project; but mine, cruel itmay be, but honourable, shall be carried out first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, señora,&rdquo; said the crafty Leonela, who knew her part, &ldquo;what is it youwant to do with this dagger? Can it be that you mean to take your ownlife, or Lothario&rsquo;s? for whichever you mean to do, it will lead to theloss of your reputation and good name. It is better to dissemble yourwrong and not give this wicked man the chance of entering the house nowand finding us alone; consider, señora, we are weak women and he is a man,and determined, and as he comes with such a base purpose, blind and urgedby passion, perhaps before you can put yours into execution he may do whatwill be worse for you than taking your life. Ill betide my master,Anselmo, for giving such authority in his house to this shameless fellow!And supposing you kill him, señora, as I suspect you mean to do, whatshall we do with him when he is dead?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, my friend?&rdquo; replied Camilla, &ldquo;we shall leave him for Anselmo tobury him; for in reason it will be to him a light labour to hide his owninfamy under ground. Summon him, make haste, for all the time I delay intaking vengeance for my wrong seems to me an offence against the loyalty Iowe my husband.&rdquo;</p><p>Anselmo was listening to all this, and every word that Camilla utteredmade him change his mind; but when he heard that it was resolved to killLothario his first impulse was to come out and show himself to avert sucha disaster; but in his anxiety to see the issue of a resolution so boldand virtuous he restrained himself, intending to come forth in time toprevent the deed. At this moment Camilla, throwing herself upon a bed thatwas close by, swooned away, and Leonela began to weep bitterly,exclaiming, &ldquo;Woe is me! that I should be fated to have dying here in myarms the flower of virtue upon earth, the crown of true wives, the patternof chastity!&rdquo; with more to the same effect, so that anyone who heard herwould have taken her for the most tender-hearted and faithful handmaid inthe world, and her mistress for another persecuted Penelope.</p><p>Camilla was not long in recovering from her fainting fit and on coming toherself she said, &ldquo;Why do you not go, Leonela, to call hither that friend,the falsest to his friend the sun ever shone upon or night concealed?Away, run, haste, speed! lest the fire of my wrath burn itself out withdelay, and the righteous vengeance that I hope for melt away in menacesand maledictions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am just going to call him, señora,&rdquo; said Leonela; &ldquo;but you must firstgive me that dagger, lest while I am gone you should by means of it givecause to all who love you to weep all their lives.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go in peace, dear Leonela, I will not do so,&rdquo; said Camilla, &ldquo;for rash andfoolish as I may be, to your mind, in defending my honour, I am not goingto be so much so as that Lucretia who they say killed herself withouthaving done anything wrong, and without having first killed him on whomthe guilt of her misfortune lay. I shall die, if I am to die; but it mustbe after full vengeance upon him who has brought me here to weep overaudacity that no fault of mine gave birth to.&rdquo;</p><p>Leonela required much pressing before she would go to summon Lothario, butat last she went, and while awaiting her return Camilla continued, as ifspeaking to herself, &ldquo;Good God! would it not have been more prudent tohave repulsed Lothario, as I have done many a time before, than to allowhim, as I am now doing, to think me unchaste and vile, even for the shorttime I must wait until I undeceive him? No doubt it would have beenbetter; but I should not be avenged, nor the honour of my husbandvindicated, should he find so clear and easy an escape from the straitinto which his depravity has led him. Let the traitor pay with his lifefor the temerity of his wanton wishes, and let the world know (if haply itshall ever come to know) that Camilla not only preserved her allegiance toher husband, but avenged him of the man who dared to wrong him. Still, Ithink it might be better to disclose this to Anselmo. But then I havecalled his attention to it in the letter I wrote to him in the country,and, if he did nothing to prevent the mischief I there pointed out to him,I suppose it was that from pure goodness of heart and trustfulness hewould not and could not believe that any thought against his honour couldharbour in the breast of so stanch a friend; nor indeed did I myselfbelieve it for many days, nor should I have ever believed it if hisinsolence had not gone so far as to make it manifest by open presents,lavish promises, and ceaseless tears. But why do I argue thus? Does a bolddetermination stand in need of arguments? Surely not. Then traitorsavaunt! Vengeance to my aid! Let the false one come, approach, advance,die, yield up his life, and then befall what may. Pure I came to him whomHeaven bestowed upon me, pure I shall leave him; and at the worst bathedin my own chaste blood and in the foul blood of the falsest friend thatfriendship ever saw in the world;&rdquo; and as she uttered these words shepaced the room holding the unsheathed dagger, with such irregular anddisordered steps, and such gestures that one would have supposed her tohave lost her senses, and taken her for some violent desperado instead ofa delicate woman.</p><p>Anselmo, concealed behind some tapestries where he had hidden himself, beheldand was amazed at all, and already felt that what he had seen and heard was asufficient answer to even greater suspicions; and he would have been now wellpleased if the proof afforded by Lothario&rsquo;s coming were dispensed with,as he feared some sudden mishap; but as he was on the point of showing himselfand coming forth to embrace and undeceive his wife he paused as he saw Leonelareturning, leading Lothario. Camilla when she saw him, drawing a long line infront of her on the floor with the dagger, said to him, &ldquo;Lothario, payattention to what I say to thee: if by any chance thou darest to cross thisline thou seest, or even approach it, the instant I see thee attempt it thatsame instant will I pierce my bosom with this dagger that I hold in my hand;and before thou answerest me a word I desire thee to listen to a few from me,and afterwards thou shalt reply as may please thee. First, I desire thee totell me, Lothario, if thou knowest my husband Anselmo, and in what light thouregardest him; and secondly I desire to know if thou knowest me too. Answer methis, without embarrassment or reflecting deeply what thou wilt answer, forthey are no riddles I put to thee.&rdquo;</p><p>Lothario was not so dull but that from the first moment when Camilladirected him to make Anselmo hide himself he understood what she intendedto do, and therefore he fell in with her idea so readily and promptly thatbetween them they made the imposture look more true than truth; so heanswered her thus: &ldquo;I did not think, fair Camilla, that thou wert callingme to ask questions so remote from the object with which I come; but if itis to defer the promised reward thou art doing so, thou mightst have putit off still longer, for the longing for happiness gives the more distressthe nearer comes the hope of gaining it; but lest thou shouldst say that Ido not answer thy questions, I say that I know thy husband Anselmo, andthat we have known each other from our earliest years; I will not speak ofwhat thou too knowest, of our friendship, that I may not compel myself totestify against the wrong that love, the mighty excuse for greater errors,makes me inflict upon him. Thee I know and hold in the same estimation ashe does, for were it not so I had not for a lesser prize acted inopposition to what I owe to my station and the holy laws of truefriendship, now broken and violated by me through that powerful enemy,love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If thou dost confess that,&rdquo; returned Camilla, &ldquo;mortal enemy of all thatrightly deserves to be loved, with what face dost thou dare to come beforeone whom thou knowest to be the mirror wherein he is reflected on whomthou shouldst look to see how unworthily thou wrongest him? But, woe is me, I nowcomprehend what has made thee give so little heed to what thou owest tothyself; it must have been some freedom of mine, for I will not call itimmodesty, as it did not proceed from any deliberate intention, but fromsome heedlessness such as women are guilty of through inadvertence whenthey think they have no occasion for reserve. But tell me, traitor, whendid I by word or sign give a reply to thy prayers that could awaken inthee a shadow of hope of attaining thy base wishes? When were not thyprofessions of love sternly and scornfully rejected and rebuked? When werethy frequent pledges and still more frequent gifts believed or accepted?But as I am persuaded that no one can long persevere in the attempt to winlove unsustained by some hope, I am willing to attribute to myself theblame of thy assurance, for no doubt some thoughtlessness of mine has allthis time fostered thy hopes; and therefore will I punish myself andinflict upon myself the penalty thy guilt deserves. And that thou mayestsee that being so relentless to myself I cannot possibly be otherwise tothee, I have summoned thee to be a witness of the sacrifice I mean tooffer to the injured honour of my honoured husband, wronged by thee withall the assiduity thou wert capable of, and by me too through want ofcaution in avoiding every occasion, if I have given any, of encouragingand sanctioning thy base designs. Once more I say the suspicion in my mindthat some imprudence of mine has engendered these lawless thoughts inthee, is what causes me most distress and what I desire most to punishwith my own hands, for were any other instrument of punishment employed myerror might become perhaps more widely known; but before I do so, in mydeath I mean to inflict death, and take with me one that will fullysatisfy my longing for the revenge I hope for and have; for I shall see,wheresoever it may be that I go, the penalty awarded by inflexible,unswerving justice on him who has placed me in a position so desperate.&rdquo;</p><p>As she uttered these words, with incredible energy and swiftness she flewupon Lothario with the naked dagger, so manifestly bent on burying it inhis breast that he was almost uncertain whether these demonstrations werereal or feigned, for he was obliged to have recourse to all his skill andstrength to prevent her from striking him; and with such reality did sheact this strange farce and mystification that, to give it a colour oftruth, she determined to stain it with her own blood; for perceiving, orpretending, that she could not wound Lothario, she said, &ldquo;Fate, it seems,will not grant my just desire complete satisfaction, but it will not beable to keep me from satisfying it partially at least;&rdquo; and making aneffort to free the hand with the dagger which Lothario held in his grasp,she released it, and directing the point to a place where it could notinflict a deep wound, she plunged it into her left side high up close tothe shoulder, and then allowed herself to fall to the ground as if in afaint.</p><p>Leonela and Lothario stood amazed and astounded at the catastrophe, andseeing Camilla stretched on the ground and bathed in her blood they werestill uncertain as to the true nature of the act. Lothario, terrified andbreathless, ran in haste to pluck out the dagger; but when he saw howslight the wound was he was relieved of his fears and once more admiredthe subtlety, coolness, and ready wit of the fair Camilla; and the betterto support the part he had to play he began to utter profuse and dolefullamentations over her body as if she were dead, invoking maledictions notonly on himself but also on him who had been the means of placing him insuch a position: and knowing that his friend Anselmo heard him he spoke insuch a way as to make a listener feel much more pity for him than forCamilla, even though he supposed her dead. Leonela took her up in her armsand laid her on the bed, entreating Lothario to go in quest of someone toattend to her wound in secret, and at the same time asking his advice andopinion as to what they should say to Anselmo about his lady&rsquo;s wound if heshould chance to return before it was healed. He replied they might saywhat they liked, for he was not in a state to give advice that would be ofany use; all he could tell her was to try and stanch the blood, as he wasgoing where he should never more be seen; and with every appearance ofdeep grief and sorrow he left the house; but when he found himself alone,and where there was nobody to see him, he crossed himself unceasingly,lost in wonder at the adroitness of Camilla and the consistent acting ofLeonela. He reflected how convinced Anselmo would be that he had a secondPortia for a wife, and he looked forward anxiously to meeting him in orderto rejoice together over falsehood and truth the most craftily veiled thatcould be imagined.</p><p>Leonela, as he told her, stanched her lady&rsquo;s blood, which was no more thansufficed to support her deception; and washing the wound with a littlewine she bound it up to the best of her skill, talking all the time shewas tending her in a strain that, even if nothing else had been saidbefore, would have been enough to assure Anselmo that he had in Camilla amodel of purity. To Leonela&rsquo;s words Camilla added her own, calling herselfcowardly and wanting in spirit, since she had not enough at the time shehad most need of it to rid herself of the life she so much loathed. Sheasked her attendant&rsquo;s advice as to whether or not she ought to inform herbeloved husband of all that had happened, but the other bade her saynothing about it, as she would lay upon him the obligation of takingvengeance on Lothario, which he could not do but at great risk to himself;and it was the duty of a true wife not to give her husband provocation toquarrel, but, on the contrary, to remove it as far as possible from him.</p><p>Camilla replied that she believed she was right and that she would followher advice, but at any rate it would be well to consider how she was toexplain the wound to Anselmo, for he could not help seeing it; to whichLeonela answered that she did not know how to tell a lie even in jest.</p><p>&ldquo;How then can I know, my dear?&rdquo; said Camilla, &ldquo;for I should not dare toforge or keep up a falsehood if my life depended on it. If we can think ofno escape from this difficulty, it will be better to tell him the plaintruth than that he should find us out in an untrue story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be not uneasy, señora,&rdquo; said Leonela; &ldquo;between this and to-morrow I willthink of what we must say to him, and perhaps the wound being where it isit can be hidden from his sight, and Heaven will be pleased to aid us in apurpose so good and honourable. Compose yourself, señora, and endeavour tocalm your excitement lest my lord find you agitated; and leave the rest tomy care and God&rsquo;s, who always supports good intentions.&rdquo;</p><p>Anselmo had with the deepest attention listened to and seen played out thetragedy of the death of his honour, which the performers acted with suchwonderfully effective truth that it seemed as if they had become therealities of the parts they played. He longed for night and an opportunityof escaping from the house to go and see his good friend Lothario, andwith him give vent to his joy over the precious pearl he had gained inhaving established his wife&rsquo;s purity. Both mistress and maid took care togive him time and opportunity to get away, and taking advantage of it hemade his escape, and at once went in quest of Lothario, and it would beimpossible to describe how he embraced him when he found him, and thethings he said to him in the joy of his heart, and the praises he bestowedupon Camilla; all which Lothario listened to without being able to showany pleasure, for he could not forget how deceived his friend was, and howdishonourably he had wronged him; and though Anselmo could see thatLothario was not glad, still he imagined it was only because he had leftCamilla wounded and had been himself the cause of it; and so among otherthings he told him not to be distressed about Camilla&rsquo;s accident, for, asthey had agreed to hide it from him, the wound was evidently trifling; andthat being so, he had no cause for fear, but should henceforward be ofgood cheer and rejoice with him, seeing that by his means and adroitnesshe found himself raised to the greatest height of happiness that he couldhave ventured to hope for, and desired no better pastime than makingverses in praise of Camilla that would preserve her name for all time tocome. Lothario commended his purpose, and promised on his own part to aidhim in raising a monument so glorious.</p><p>And so Anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could bein the world. He himself, persuaded he was conducting the instrument ofhis glory, led home by the hand of him who had been the utter destruction ofhis good name; whom Camilla received with averted countenance, though withsmiles in her heart. The deception was carried on for some time, until atthe end of a few months Fortune turned her wheel and the guilt which hadbeen until then so skilfully concealed was published abroad, and Anselmopaid with his life the penalty of his ill-advised curiosity.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF THE HEROIC AND PRODIGIOUS BATTLE DON QUIXOTE HAD WITHCERTAIN SKINS OF RED WINE, AND BRINGS THE NOVEL OF &ldquo;THE ILL-ADVISEDCURIOSITY&rdquo; TO A CLOSE</h3><p>There remained but little more of the novel to be read, when Sancho Panzaburst forth in wild excitement from the garret where Don Quixote waslying, shouting, &ldquo;Run, sirs! quick; and help my master, who is in thethick of the toughest and stiffest battle I ever laid eyes on. By theliving God he has given the giant, the enemy of my lady the PrincessMicomicona, such a slash that he has sliced his head clean off as if itwere a turnip.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, brother?&rdquo; said the curate, pausing as he wasabout to read the remainder of the novel. &ldquo;Are you in your senses, Sancho?How the devil can it be as you say, when the giant is two thousand leaguesaway?&rdquo;</p><p>Here they heard a loud noise in the chamber, and Don Quixote shouting out,&ldquo;Stand, thief, brigand, villain; now I have got thee, and thy scimitarshall not avail thee!&rdquo; And then it seemed as though he were slashingvigorously at the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop to listen,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but go in and part them or help mymaster: though there is no need of that now, for no doubt the giant isdead by this time and giving account to God of his past wicked life; for Isaw the blood flowing on the ground, and the head cut off and fallen onone side, and it is as big as a large wine-skin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May I die,&rdquo; said the landlord at this, &ldquo;if Don Quixote or Don Devil hasnot been slashing some of the skins of red wine that stand full at hisbed&rsquo;s head, and the spilt wine must be what this good fellow takes forblood;&rdquo; and so saying he went into the room and the rest after him, andthere they found Don Quixote in the strangest costume in the world. He wasin his shirt, which was not long enough in front to cover his thighscompletely and was six fingers shorter behind; his legs were very long andlean, covered with hair, and anything but clean; on his head he had alittle greasy red cap that belonged to the host, round his left arm he hadrolled the blanket of the bed, to which Sancho, for reasons best known tohimself, owed a grudge, and in his right hand he held his unsheathedsword, with which he was slashing about on all sides, utteringexclamations as if he were actually fighting some giant: and the best ofit was his eyes were not open, for he was fast asleep, and dreaming thathe was doing battle with the giant. For his imagination was so wroughtupon by the adventure he was going to accomplish, that it made him dreamhe had already reached the kingdom of Micomicon, and was engaged in combatwith his enemy; and believing he was laying on the giant, he had given somany sword cuts to the skins that the whole room was full of wine. Onseeing this the landlord was so enraged that he fell on Don Quixote, andwith his clenched fist began to pummel him in such a way, that if Cardenioand the curate had not dragged him off, he would have brought the war ofthe giant to an end. But in spite of all the poor gentleman never wokeuntil the barber brought a great pot of cold water from the well and flungit with one dash all over his body, on which Don Quixote woke up, but notso completely as to understand what was the matter. Dorothea, seeing howshort and slight his attire was, would not go in to witness the battlebetween her champion and her opponent. As for Sancho, he went searchingall over the floor for the head of the giant, and not finding it he said,&ldquo;I see now that it&rsquo;s all enchantment in this house; for the last time, onthis very spot where I am now, I got ever so many thumps without knowingwho gave them to me, or being able to see anybody; and now this head isnot to be seen anywhere about, though I saw it cut off with my own eyesand the blood running from the body as if from a fountain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What blood and fountains are you talking about, enemy of God and hissaints?&rdquo; said the landlord. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, you thief, that the blood andthe fountain are only these skins here that have been stabbed and the redwine swimming all over the room?&mdash;and I wish I saw the soul of himthat stabbed them swimming in hell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know nothing about that,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;all I know is it will be my badluck that through not finding this head my county will melt away like saltin water;&rdquo;&mdash;for Sancho awake was worse than his master asleep, somuch had his master&rsquo;s promises addled his wits.</p><p>The landlord was beside himself at the coolness of the squire and themischievous doings of the master, and swore it should not be like the lasttime when they went without paying; and that their privileges of chivalryshould not hold good this time to let one or other of them off withoutpaying, even to the cost of the plugs that would have to be put to thedamaged wine-skins. The curate was holding Don Quixote&rsquo;s hands, who,fancying he had now ended the adventure and was in the presence of thePrincess Micomicona, knelt before the curate and said, &ldquo;Exalted andbeauteous lady, your highness may live from this day forth fearless of anyharm this base being could do you; and I too from this day forth amreleased from the promise I gave you, since by the help of God on high andby the favour of her by whom I live and breathe, I have fulfilled it sosuccessfully.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did not I say so?&rdquo; said Sancho on hearing this. &ldquo;You see I wasn&rsquo;t drunk;there you see my master has already salted the giant; there&rsquo;s no doubtabout the bulls; my county is all right!&rdquo;</p><p>Who could have helped laughing at the absurdities of the pair, master andman? And laugh they did, all except the landlord, who cursed himself; butat length the barber, Cardenio, and the curate contrived with no smalltrouble to get Don Quixote on the bed, and he fell asleep with everyappearance of excessive weariness. They left him to sleep, and came out tothe gate of the inn to console Sancho Panza on not having found the headof the giant; but much more work had they to appease the landlord, who wasfurious at the sudden death of his wine-skins; and said the landlady halfscolding, half crying, &ldquo;At an evil moment and in an unlucky hour he cameinto my house, this knight-errant&mdash;would that I had never set eyes onhim, for dear he has cost me; the last time he went off with the overnightscore against him for supper, bed, straw, and barley, for himself and hissquire and a hack and an ass, saying he was a knight adventurer&mdash;Godsend unlucky adventures to him and all the adventurers in the world&mdash;andtherefore not bound to pay anything, for it was so settled by theknight-errantry tariff: and then, all because of him, came the othergentleman and carried off my tail, and gives it back more than twocuartillos the worse, all stripped of its hair, so that it is no use formy husband&rsquo;s purpose; and then, for a finishing touch to all, to burst mywine-skins and spill my wine! I wish I saw his own blood spilt! But lethim not deceive himself, for, by the bones of my father and the shade ofmy mother, they shall pay me down every quarto; or my name is not what itis, and I am not my father&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; All this and more to the sameeffect the landlady delivered with great irritation, and her good maidMaritornes backed her up, while the daughter held her peace and smiledfrom time to time. The curate smoothed matters by promising to make goodall losses to the best of his power, not only as regarded the wine-skinsbut also the wine, and above all the depreciation of the tail which theyset such store by. Dorothea comforted Sancho, telling him that she pledgedherself, as soon as it should appear certain that his master haddecapitated the giant, and she found herself peacefully established in herkingdom, to bestow upon him the best county there was in it. With thisSancho consoled himself, and assured the princess she might rely upon itthat he had seen the head of the giant, and more by token it had a beardthat reached to the girdle, and that if it was not to be seen now it wasbecause everything that happened in that house went by enchantment, as hehimself had proved the last time he had lodged there. Dorothea said shefully believed it, and that he need not be uneasy, for all would go welland turn out as he wished. All therefore being appeased, the curate wasanxious to go on with the novel, as he saw there was but little more leftto read. Dorothea and the others begged him to finish it, and he, as hewas willing to please them, and enjoyed reading it himself, continued thetale in these words:</p><p class="p2">The result was, that from the confidence Anselmo felt in Camilla&rsquo;s virtue,he lived happy and free from anxiety, and Camilla purposely looked coldlyon Lothario, that Anselmo might suppose her feelings towards him to be theopposite of what they were; and the better to support the position,Lothario begged to be excused from coming to the house, as the displeasurewith which Camilla regarded his presence was plain to be seen. But thebefooled Anselmo said he would on no account allow such a thing, and so ina thousand ways he became the author of his own dishonour, while hebelieved he was insuring his happiness. Meanwhile the satisfaction withwhich Leonela saw herself empowered to carry on her amour reached such aheight that, regardless of everything else, she followed her inclinationsunrestrainedly, feeling confident that her mistress would screen her, andeven show her how to manage it safely. At last one night Anselmo heardfootsteps in Leonela&rsquo;s room, and on trying to enter to see who it was, hefound that the door was held against him, which made him all the moredetermined to open it; and exerting his strength he forced it open, andentered the room in time to see a man leaping through the window into thestreet. He ran quickly to seize him or discover who he was, but he wasunable to effect either purpose, for Leonela flung her arms round himcrying, &ldquo;Be calm, señor; do not give way to passion or follow him who hasescaped from this; he belongs to me, and in fact he is my husband.&rdquo;</p><p>Anselmo would not believe it, but blind with rage drew a dagger andthreatened to stab Leonela, bidding her tell the truth or he would killher. She, in her fear, not knowing what she was saying, exclaimed, &ldquo;Do notkill me, señor, for I can tell you things more important than any you canimagine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me then at once or thou diest,&rdquo; said Anselmo.</p><p>&ldquo;It would be impossible for me now,&rdquo; said Leonela, &ldquo;I am so agitated:leave me till to-morrow, and then you shall hear from me what will fillyou with astonishment; but rest assured that he who leaped through thewindow is a young man of this city, who has given me his promise to becomemy husband.&rdquo;</p><p>Anselmo was appeased with this, and was content to wait the time she askedof him, for he never expected to hear anything against Camilla, sosatisfied and sure of her virtue was he; and so he quitted the room, andleft Leonela locked in, telling her she should not come out until she hadtold him all she had to make known to him. He went at once to see Camilla,and tell her, as he did, all that had passed between him and her handmaid,and the promise she had given him to inform him matters of seriousimportance.</p><p>There is no need of saying whether Camilla was agitated or not, for sogreat was her fear and dismay, that, making sure, as she had good reasonto do, that Leonela would tell Anselmo all she knew of her faithlessness,she had not the courage to wait and see if her suspicions were confirmed;and that same night, as soon as she thought that Anselmo was asleep, shepacked up the most valuable jewels she had and some money, and withoutbeing observed by anybody escaped from the house and betook herself toLothario&rsquo;s, to whom she related what had occurred, imploring him to conveyher to some place of safety or fly with her where they might be safe fromAnselmo. The state of perplexity to which Camilla reduced Lothario wassuch that he was unable to utter a word in reply, still less to decideupon what he should do. At length he resolved to conduct her to a conventof which a sister of his was prioress; Camilla agreed to this, and withthe speed which the circumstances demanded, Lothario took her to theconvent and left her there, and then himself quitted the city withoutletting anyone know of his departure.</p><p>As soon as daylight came Anselmo, without missing Camilla from his side,rose eager to learn what Leonela had to tell him, and hastened to the roomwhere he had locked her in. He opened the door, entered, but found noLeonela; all he found was some sheets knotted to the window, a plain proofthat she had let herself down from it and escaped. He returned, uneasy, totell Camilla, but not finding her in bed or anywhere in the house he waslost in amazement. He asked the servants of the house about her, but noneof them could give him any explanation. As he was going in search ofCamilla it happened by chance that he observed her boxes were lying open,and that the greater part of her jewels were gone; and now he became fullyaware of his disgrace, and that Leonela was not the cause of hismisfortune; and, just as he was, without delaying to dress himselfcompletely, he repaired, sad at heart and dejected, to his friend Lotharioto make known his sorrow to him; but when he failed to find him and theservants reported that he had been absent from his house all night and hadtaken with him all the money he had, he felt as though he were losing hissenses; and to make all complete on returning to his own house he found itdeserted and empty, not one of all his servants, male or female, remainingin it. He knew not what to think, or say, or do, and his reason seemed tobe deserting him little by little. He reviewed his position, and sawhimself in a moment left without wife, friend, or servants, abandoned, hefelt, by the heaven above him, and more than all robbed of his honour, forin Camilla&rsquo;s disappearance he saw his own ruin. After long reflection heresolved at last to go to his friend&rsquo;s village, where he had been stayingwhen he afforded opportunities for the contrivance of this complication ofmisfortune. He locked the doors of his house, mounted his horse, and witha broken spirit set out on his journey; but he had hardly gone half-waywhen, harassed by his reflections, he had to dismount and tie his horse toa tree, at the foot of which he threw himself, giving vent to piteousheartrending sighs; and there he remained till nearly nightfall, when heobserved a man approaching on horseback from the city, of whom, aftersaluting him, he asked what was the news in Florence.</p><p>The citizen replied, &ldquo;The strangest that have been heard for many a day;for it is reported abroad that Lothario, the great friend of the wealthyAnselmo, who lived at San Giovanni, carried off last night Camilla, thewife of Anselmo, who also has disappeared. All this has been told by amaid-servant of Camilla&rsquo;s, whom the governor found last night loweringherself by a sheet from the windows of Anselmo&rsquo;s house. I know not indeed,precisely, how the affair came to pass; all I know is that the whole cityis wondering at the occurrence, for no one could have expected a thing ofthe kind, seeing the great and intimate friendship that existed betweenthem, so great, they say, that they were called &lsquo;The Two Friends.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it known at all,&rdquo; said Anselmo, &ldquo;what road Lothario and Camilla took?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said the citizen, &ldquo;though the governor has been veryactive in searching for them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God speed you, señor,&rdquo; said Anselmo.</p><p>&ldquo;God be with you,&rdquo; said the citizen and went his way.</p><p>This disastrous intelligence almost robbed Anselmo not only of his sensesbut of his life. He got up as well as he was able and reached the house ofhis friend, who as yet knew nothing of his misfortune, but seeing him comepale, worn, and haggard, perceived that he was suffering some heavyaffliction. Anselmo at once begged to be allowed to retire to rest, and tobe given writing materials. His wish was complied with and he was leftlying down and alone, for he desired this, and even that the door shouldbe locked. Finding himself alone he so took to heart the thought of hismisfortune that by the signs of death he felt within him he knew well hislife was drawing to a close, and therefore he resolved to leave behind hima declaration of the cause of his strange end. He began to write, butbefore he had put down all he meant to say, his breath failed him and heyielded up his life, a victim to the suffering which his ill-advisedcuriosity had entailed upon him. The master of the house observing that itwas now late and that Anselmo did not call, determined to go in andascertain if his indisposition was increasing, and found him lying on hisface, his body partly in the bed, partly on the writing-table, on which helay with the written paper open and the pen still in his hand. Havingfirst called to him without receiving any answer, his host approached him,and taking him by the hand, found that it was cold, and saw that he wasdead. Greatly surprised and distressed he summoned the household towitness the sad fate which had befallen Anselmo; and then he read thepaper, the handwriting of which he recognised as his, and which containedthese words:</p><p>&ldquo;A foolish and ill-advised desire has robbed me of life. If the news of mydeath should reach the ears of Camilla, let her know that I forgive her,for she was not bound to perform miracles, nor ought I to have requiredher to perform them; and since I have been the author of my own dishonour,there is no reason why&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>So far Anselmo had written, and thus it was plain that at this point,before he could finish what he had to say, his life came to an end. Thenext day his friend sent intelligence of his death to his relatives, whohad already ascertained his misfortune, as well as the convent whereCamilla lay almost on the point of accompanying her husband on thatinevitable journey, not on account of the tidings of his death, butbecause of those she received of her lover&rsquo;s departure. Although she sawherself a widow, it is said she refused either to quit the convent or takethe veil, until, not long afterwards, intelligence reached her thatLothario had been killed in a battle in which M. de Lautrec had beenrecently engaged with the Great Captain Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordova inthe kingdom of Naples, whither her too late repentant lover had repaired.On learning this Camilla took the veil, and shortly afterwards died, wornout by grief and melancholy. This was the end of all three, an end thatcame of a thoughtless beginning.</p><p>&ldquo;I like this novel,&rdquo; said the curate; &ldquo;but I cannot persuade myself of itstruth; and if it has been invented, the author&rsquo;s invention is faulty, forit is impossible to imagine any husband so foolish as to try such a costlyexperiment as Anselmo&rsquo;s. If it had been represented as occurring between agallant and his mistress it might pass; but between husband and wife thereis something of an impossibility about it. As to the way in which thestory is told, however, I have no fault to find.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch36" id="ch36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF MORE CURIOUS INCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED AT THE INN</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c36a" id="c36a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c36a.jpg (124K)" src="images/c36a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c36a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Just at that instant the landlord, who was standing at the gate of theinn, exclaimed, &ldquo;Here comes a fine troop of guests; if they stop here wemay say <i>gaudeamus</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; said Cardenio.</p><p>&ldquo;Four men,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;riding <i>à la jineta</i>,with lances and bucklers, and all with black veils, and with them there is awoman in white on a side-saddle, whose face is also veiled, and two attendantson foot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are they very near?&rdquo; said the curate.</p><p>&ldquo;So near,&rdquo; answered the landlord, &ldquo;that here they come.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing this Dorothea covered her face, and Cardenio retreated into DonQuixote&rsquo;s room, and they hardly had time to do so before the whole partythe host had described entered the inn, and the four that were onhorseback, who were of highbred appearance and bearing, dismounted, andcame forward to take down the woman who rode on the side-saddle, and oneof them taking her in his arms placed her in a chair that stood at theentrance of the room where Cardenio had hidden himself. All this timeneither she nor they had removed their veils or spoken a word, only onsitting down on the chair the woman gave a deep sigh and let her arms falllike one that was ill and weak. The attendants on foot then led the horsesaway to the stable. Observing this the curate, curious to know who thesepeople in such a dress and preserving such silence were, went to where theservants were standing and put the question to one of them, who answeredhim.</p><p>&ldquo;Faith, sir, I cannot tell you who they are, I only know they seem to bepeople of distinction, particularly he who advanced to take the lady yousaw in his arms; and I say so because all the rest show him respect, andnothing is done except what he directs and orders.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the lady, who is she?&rdquo; asked the curate.</p><p>&ldquo;That I cannot tell you either,&rdquo; said the servant, &ldquo;for I have not seenher face all the way: I have indeed heard her sigh many times and uttersuch groans that she seems to be giving up the ghost every time; but it isno wonder if we do not know more than we have told you, as my comrade andI have only been in their company two days, for having met us on the roadthey begged and persuaded us to accompany them to Andalusia, promising topay us well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And have you heard any of them called by his name?&rdquo; asked the curate.</p><p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; replied the servant; &ldquo;they all preserve a marvellous silenceon the road, for not a sound is to be heard among them except the poorlady&rsquo;s sighs and sobs, which make us pity her; and we feel sure thatwherever it is she is going, it is against her will, and as far as one canjudge from her dress she is a nun or, what is more likely, about to becomeone; and perhaps it is because taking the vows is not of her own freewill, that she is so unhappy as she seems to be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That may well be,&rdquo; said the curate, and leaving them he returned to whereDorothea was, who, hearing the veiled lady sigh, moved by naturalcompassion drew near to her and said, &ldquo;What are you suffering from,señora? If it be anything that women are accustomed and know how torelieve, I offer you my services with all my heart.&rdquo;</p><p>To this the unhappy lady made no reply; and though Dorothea repeated heroffers more earnestly she still kept silence, until the gentleman with theveil, who, the servant said, was obeyed by the rest, approached and saidto Dorothea, &ldquo;Do not give yourself the trouble, señora, of making anyoffers to that woman, for it is her way to give no thanks for anythingthat is done for her; and do not try to make her answer unless you want tohear some lie from her lips.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have never told a lie,&rdquo; was the immediate reply of her who had beensilent until now; &ldquo;on the contrary, it is because I am so truthful and soignorant of lying devices that I am now in this miserable condition; andthis I call you yourself to witness, for it is my unstained truth that hasmade you false and a liar.&rdquo;</p><p>Cardenio heard these words clearly and distinctly, being quite close tothe speaker, for there was only the door of Don Quixote&rsquo;s room betweenthem, and the instant he did so, uttering a loud exclamation he cried,&ldquo;Good God! what is this I hear? What voice is this that has reached myears?&rdquo; Startled at the voice the lady turned her head; and not seeing thespeaker she stood up and attempted to enter the room; observing which thegentleman held her back, preventing her from moving a step. In heragitation and sudden movement the silk with which she had covered her facefell off and disclosed a countenance of incomparable and marvellousbeauty, but pale and terrified; for she kept turning her eyes, everywhereshe could direct her gaze, with an eagerness that made her look as if shehad lost her senses, and so marked that it excited the pity of Dorotheaand all who beheld her, though they knew not what caused it. The gentlemangrasped her firmly by the shoulders, and being so fully occupied withholding her back, he was unable to put a hand to his veil which wasfalling off, as it did at length entirely, and Dorothea, who was holdingthe lady in her arms, raising her eyes saw that he who likewise held herwas her husband, Don Fernando. The instant she recognised him, with aprolonged plaintive cry drawn from the depths of her heart, she fellbackwards fainting, and but for the barber being close by to catch her inhis arms, she would have fallen completely to the ground. The curate atonce hastened to uncover her face and throw water on it, and as he did soDon Fernando, for he it was who held the other in his arms, recognised herand stood as if death-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing hisgrasp of Luscinda, for it was she that was struggling to release herselffrom his hold, having recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he hadrecognised her. Cardenio also heard Dorothea&rsquo;s cry as she fell fainting,and imagining that it came from his Luscinda burst forth in terror fromthe room, and the first thing he saw was Don Fernando with Luscinda in hisarms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three, Luscinda,Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcely knowing whathad happened to them.</p><p>They gazed at one another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando, DonFernando at Cardenio, Cardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda at Cardenio. Thefirst to break silence was Luscinda, who thus addressed Don Fernando:&ldquo;Leave me, Señor Don Fernando, for the sake of what you owe to yourself;if no other reason will induce you, leave me to cling to the wall of whichI am the ivy, to the support from which neither your importunities, noryour threats, nor your promises, nor your gifts have been able to detachme. See how Heaven, by ways strange and hidden from our sight, has broughtme face to face with my true husband; and well you know by dear-boughtexperience that death alone will be able to efface him from my memory. Maythis plain declaration, then, lead you, as you can do nothing else, toturn your love into rage, your affection into resentment, and so to takemy life; for if I yield it up in the presence of my beloved husband Icount it well bestowed; it may be by my death he will be convinced that Ikept my faith to him to the last moment of life.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile Dorothea had come to herself, and had heard Luscinda&rsquo;s words, bymeans of which she divined who she was; but seeing that Don Fernando didnot yet release her or reply to her, summoning up her resolution as wellas she could she rose and knelt at his feet, and with a flood of brightand touching tears addressed him thus:</p><p>&ldquo;If, my lord, the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thinearms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight thou wouldst have seen bythis time that she who kneels at thy feet is, so long as thou wilt have itso, the unhappy and unfortunate Dorothea. I am that lowly peasant girlwhom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst raise high enough tocall herself thine; I am she who in the seclusion of innocence led acontented life until at the voice of thy importunity, and thy true andtender passion, as it seemed, she opened the gates of her modesty andsurrendered to thee the keys of her liberty; a gift received by thee butthanklessly, as is clearly shown by my forced retreat to the place wherethou dost find me, and by thy appearance under the circumstances in whichI see thee. Nevertheless, I would not have thee suppose that I have comehere driven by my shame; it is only grief and sorrow at seeing myselfforgotten by thee that have led me. It was thy will to make me thine, andthou didst so follow thy will, that now, even though thou repentest, thoucanst not help being mine. Bethink thee, my lord, the unsurpassableaffection I bear thee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth forwhich thou wouldst desert me. Thou canst not be the fair Luscinda&rsquo;sbecause thou art mine, nor can she be thine because she is Cardenio&rsquo;s; andit will be easier, remember, to bend thy will to love one who adores thee,than to lead one to love thee who abhors thee now. Thou didst addressthyself to my simplicity, thou didst lay siege to my virtue, thou wert notignorant of my station, well dost thou know how I yielded wholly to thywill; there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception, and if itbe so, as it is, and if thou art a Christian as thou art a gentleman, whydost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy at last as thoudidst at first? And if thou wilt not have me for what I am, thy true andlawful wife, at least take and accept me as thy slave, for so long as I amthine I will count myself happy and fortunate. Do not by deserting me letmy shame become the talk of the gossips in the streets; make not the oldage of my parents miserable; for the loyal services they as faithfulvassals have ever rendered thine are not deserving of such a return; andif thou thinkest it will debase thy blood to mingle it with mine, reflectthat there is little or no nobility in the world that has not travelledthe same road, and that in illustrious lineages it is not the woman&rsquo;sblood that is of account; and, moreover, that true nobility consists invirtue, and if thou art wanting in that, refusing me what in justice thouowest me, then even I have higher claims to nobility than thine. To makean end, señor, these are my last words to thee: whether thou wilt, or wiltnot, I am thy wife; witness thy words, which must not and ought not to befalse, if thou dost pride thyself on that for want of which thou scornestme; witness the pledge which thou didst give me, and witness Heaven, whichthou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me; and ifall this fail, thy own conscience will not fail to lift up its silentvoice in the midst of all thy gaiety, and vindicate the truth of what Isay and mar thy highest pleasure and enjoyment.&rdquo;</p><p>All this and more the injured Dorothea delivered with such earnest feelingand such tears that all present, even those who came with Don Fernando,were constrained to join her in them. Don Fernando listened to her withoutreplying, until, ceasing to speak, she gave way to such sobs and sighsthat it must have been a heart of brass that was not softened by the sightof so great sorrow. Luscinda stood regarding her with no less compassionfor her sufferings than admiration for her intelligence and beauty, andwould have gone to her to say some words of comfort to her, but wasprevented by Don Fernando&rsquo;s grasp which held her fast. He, overwhelmedwith confusion and astonishment, after regarding Dorothea for some momentswith a fixed gaze, opened his arms, and, releasing Luscinda, exclaimed:</p><p>&ldquo;Thou hast conquered, fair Dorothea, thou hast conquered, for it isimpossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many truths.&rdquo;</p><p>Luscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the ground whenDon Fernando released her, but Cardenio, who stood near, having retreatedbehind Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting fear aside andregardless of what might happen, ran forward to support her, and said ashe clasped her in his arms, &ldquo;If Heaven in its compassion is willing to letthee rest at last, mistress of my heart, true, constant, and fair, nowherecanst thou rest more safely than in these arms that now receive thee, andreceived thee before when fortune permitted me to call thee mine.&rdquo;</p><p>At these words Luscinda looked up at Cardenio, at first beginning torecognise him by his voice and then satisfying herself by her eyes that itwas he, and hardly knowing what she did, and heedless of allconsiderations of decorum, she flung her arms around his neck and pressingher face close to his, said, &ldquo;Yes, my dear lord, you are the true masterof this your slave, even though adverse fate interpose again, and freshdangers threaten this life that hangs on yours.&rdquo;</p><p>A strange sight was this for Don Fernando and those that stood around,filled with surprise at an incident so unlooked for. Dorothea fancied thatDon Fernando changed colour and looked as though he meant to takevengeance on Cardenio, for she observed him put his hand to his sword; andthe instant the idea struck her, with wonderful quickness she clasped himround the knees, and kissing them and holding him so as to prevent hismoving, she said, while her tears continued to flow, &ldquo;What is it thouwouldst do, my only refuge, in this unforeseen event? Thou hast thy wifeat thy feet, and she whom thou wouldst have for thy wife is in the arms ofher husband: reflect whether it will be right for thee, whether it will bepossible for thee to undo what Heaven has done, or whether it will bebecoming in thee to seek to raise her to be thy mate who in spite of everyobstacle, and strong in her truth and constancy, is before thine eyes,bathing with the tears of love the face and bosom of her lawful husband.For God&rsquo;s sake I entreat of thee, for thine own I implore thee, let notthis open manifestation rouse thy anger; but rather so calm it as to allowthese two lovers to live in peace and quiet without any interference fromthee so long as Heaven permits them; and in so doing thou wilt prove thegenerosity of thy lofty noble spirit, and the world shall see that withthee reason has more influence than passion.&rdquo;</p><p>All the time Dorothea was speaking, Cardenio, though he held Luscinda inhis arms, never took his eyes off Don Fernando, determined, if he saw himmake any hostile movement, to try and defend himself and resist as best hecould all who might assail him, though it should cost him his life. Butnow Don Fernando&rsquo;s friends, as well as the curate and the barber, who hadbeen present all the while, not forgetting the worthy Sancho Panza, ranforward and gathered round Don Fernando, entreating him to have regard forthe tears of Dorothea, and not suffer her reasonable hopes to bedisappointed, since, as they firmly believed, what she said was but thetruth; and bidding him observe that it was not, as it might seem, byaccident, but by a special disposition of Providence that they had all metin a place where no one could have expected a meeting. And the curate badehim remember that only death could part Luscinda from Cardenio; that evenif some sword were to separate them they would think their death mosthappy; and that in a case that admitted of no remedy his wisest coursewas, by conquering and putting a constraint upon himself, to show agenerous mind, and of his own accord suffer these two to enjoy thehappiness Heaven had granted them. He bade him, too, turn his eyes uponthe beauty of Dorothea and he would see that few if any could equal muchless excel her; while to that beauty should be added her modesty and thesurpassing love she bore him. But besides all this, he reminded him thatif he prided himself on being a gentleman and a Christian, he could not dootherwise than keep his plighted word; and that in doing so he would obeyGod and meet the approval of all sensible people, who know and recognisedit to be the privilege of beauty, even in one of humble birth, providedvirtue accompany it, to be able to raise itself to the level of any rank,without any slur upon him who places it upon an equality with himself; andfurthermore that when the potent sway of passion asserts itself, so longas there be no mixture of sin in it, he is not to be blamed who gives wayto it.</p><p>To be brief, they added to these such other forcible arguments that DonFernando&rsquo;s manly heart, being after all nourished by noble blood, wastouched, and yielded to the truth which, even had he wished it, he couldnot gainsay; and he showed his submission, and acceptance of the goodadvice that had been offered to him, by stooping down and embracingDorothea, saying to her, &ldquo;Rise, dear lady, it is not right that what Ihold in my heart should be kneeling at my feet; and if until now I haveshown no sign of what I own, it may have been by Heaven&rsquo;s decree in orderthat, seeing the constancy with which you love me, I may learn to valueyou as you deserve. What I entreat of you is that you reproach me not withmy transgression and grievous wrong-doing; for the same cause and forcethat drove me to make you mine impelled me to struggle against beingyours; and to prove this, turn and look at the eyes of the now happyLuscinda, and you will see in them an excuse for all my errors: and as shehas found and gained the object of her desires, and I have found in youwhat satisfies all my wishes, may she live in peace and contentment asmany happy years with her Cardenio, as on my knees I pray Heaven to allowme to live with my Dorothea;&rdquo; and with these words he once more embracedher and pressed his face to hers with so much tenderness that he had totake great heed to keep his tears from completing the proof of his loveand repentance in the sight of all. Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, andalmost all the others, for they shed so many tears, some in their ownhappiness, some at that of the others, that one would have supposed aheavy calamity had fallen upon them all. Even Sancho Panza was weeping;though afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that Dorothea wasnot as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he expected such greatfavours. Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and thenCardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don Fernando,returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them in language sograteful that he knew not how to answer them, and raising them up embracedthem with every mark of affection and courtesy.</p><p>He then asked Dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so far removedfrom her own home, and she in a few fitting words told all that she hadpreviously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and his companionswere so delighted that they wished the story had been longer; socharmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When she had finishedDon Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city after he hadfound in Luscinda&rsquo;s bosom the paper in which she declared that she wasCardenio&rsquo;s wife, and never could be his. He said he meant to kill her, andwould have done so had he not been prevented by her parents, and that hequitted the house full of rage and shame, and resolved to avenge himselfwhen a more convenient opportunity should offer. The next day he learnedthat Luscinda had disappeared from her father&rsquo;s house, and that no onecould tell whither she had gone. Finally, at the end of some months heascertained that she was in a convent and meant to remain there all therest of her life, if she were not to share it with Cardenio; and as soonas he had learned this, taking these three gentlemen as his companions, hearrived at the place where she was, but avoided speaking to her, fearingthat if it were known he was there stricter precautions would be taken inthe convent; and watching a time when the porter&rsquo;s lodge was open he lefttwo to guard the gate, and he and the other entered the convent in questof Luscinda, whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one ofthe nuns, and carrying her off without giving her time to resist, theyreached a place with her where they provided themselves with what theyrequired for taking her away; all which they were able to do in completesafety, as the convent was in the country at a considerable distance fromthe city. He added that when Luscinda found herself in his power she lostall consciousness, and after returning to herself did nothing but weep andsigh without speaking a word; and thus in silence and tears they reachedthat inn, which for him was reaching heaven where all the mischances ofearth are over and at an end.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c36b" id="c36b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c36b.jpg (319K)" src="images/c36b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c36b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c36e" id="c36e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c36e.jpg (36K)" src="images/c36e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch37" id="ch37"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br/>IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE STORY OF THE FAMOUS PRINCESS MICOMICONA, WITHOTHER DROLL ADVENTURES</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c37a" id="c37a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c37a.jpg (159K)" src="images/c37a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c37a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>To all this Sancho listened with no little sorrow at heart to see how hishopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke, and how the fairPrincess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant into DonFernando, while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totally unconscious ofall that had come to pass. Dorothea was unable to persuade herself thather present happiness was not all a dream; Cardenio was in a similar stateof mind, and Luscinda&rsquo;s thoughts ran in the same direction. Don Fernandogave thanks to Heaven for the favour shown to him and for having beenrescued from the intricate labyrinth in which he had been brought so nearthe destruction of his good name and of his soul; and in short everybodyin the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction at the happy issue ofsuch a complicated and hopeless business. The curate as a sensible manmade sound reflections upon the whole affair, and congratulated each uponhis good fortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and goodhumour was the landlady, because of the promise Cardenio and the curatehad given her to pay for all the losses and damage she had sustainedthrough Don Quixote&rsquo;s means. Sancho, as has been already said, was theonly one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected; and so with a longface he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and said to him:</p><p>&ldquo;Sir Rueful Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as youlike, without troubling yourself about killing any giant or restoring herkingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settled now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should think it was,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;for I have had the mostprodigious and stupendous battle with the giant that I ever rememberhaving had all the days of my life; and with one back-stroke&mdash;swish!&mdash;Ibrought his head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forthfrom him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like red wine, your worship had better say,&rdquo; replied Sancho; &ldquo;for I wouldhave you know, if you don&rsquo;t know it, that the dead giant is a hackedwine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine that it hadin its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore me; and thedevil take it all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What art thou talking about, fool?&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;art thou in thysenses?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let your worship get up,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and you will see the nicebusiness you have made of it, and what we have to pay; and you will seethe queen turned into a private lady called Dorothea, and other thingsthat will astonish you, if you understand them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall not be surprised at anything of the kind,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote;&ldquo;for if thou dost remember the last time we were here I told thee thateverything that happened here was a matter of enchantment, and it would beno wonder if it were the same now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could believe all that,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;if my blanketing was the samesort of thing also; only it wasn&rsquo;t, but real and genuine; for I saw thelandlord, who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket and jerkingme up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as much laughter asstrength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing people, I hold for mypart, simple and sinner as I am, that there is no enchantment about it atall, but a great deal of bruising and bad luck.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, well, God will give a remedy,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;hand me myclothes and let me go out, for I want to see these transformations andthings thou speakest of.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was dressing, the curate gaveDon Fernando and the others present an account of Don Quixote&rsquo;s madnessand of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from that PenaPobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his lady&rsquo;s scorn. Hedescribed to them also nearly all the adventures that Sancho hadmentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a little, thinking it,as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazy intellect could becapable of. But now, the curate said, that the lady Dorothea&rsquo;s goodfortune prevented her from proceeding with their purpose, it would benecessary to devise or discover some other way of getting him home.</p><p>Cardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun, and suggestedthat Luscinda would act and support Dorothea&rsquo;s part sufficiently well.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Don Fernando, &ldquo;that must not be, for I want Dorothea to followout this idea of hers; and if the worthy gentleman&rsquo;s village is not veryfar off, I shall be happy if I can do anything for his relief.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is not more than two days&rsquo; journey from this,&rdquo; said the curate.</p><p>&ldquo;Even if it were more,&rdquo; said Don Fernando, &ldquo;I would gladly travel so farfor the sake of doing so good a work.&rdquo;</p><p>At this moment Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino&rsquo;shelmet, all dinted as it was, on his head, his buckler on his arm, andleaning on his staff or pike. The strange figure he presented filled DonFernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean yellowface half a league long, his armour of all sorts, and the solemnity of hisdeportment. They stood silent waiting to see what he would say, and he,fixing his eyes on the fair Dorothea, addressed her with great gravity andcomposure:</p><p>&ldquo;I am informed, fair lady, by my squire here that your greatness has beenannihilated and your being abolished, since, from a queen and lady of highdegree as you used to be, you have been turned into a private maiden. Ifthis has been done by the command of the magician king your father,through fear that I should not afford you the aid you need and areentitled to, I may tell you he did not know and does not know half themass, and was little versed in the annals of chivalry; for, if he had readand gone through them as attentively and deliberately as I have, he wouldhave found at every turn that knights of less renown than mine haveaccomplished things more difficult: it is no great matter to kill a whelpof a giant, however arrogant he may be; for it is not many hours since Imyself was engaged with one, and&mdash;I will not speak of it, that theymay not say I am lying; time, however, that reveals all, will tell thetale when we least expect it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You were engaged with a couple of wine-skins, and not a giant,&rdquo; said thelandlord at this; but Don Fernando told him to hold his tongue and on noaccount interrupt Don Quixote, who continued, &ldquo;I say in conclusion, highand disinherited lady, that if your father has brought about thismetamorphosis in your person for the reason I have mentioned, you oughtnot to attach any importance to it; for there is no peril on earth throughwhich my sword will not force a way, and with it, before many days areover, I will bring your enemy&rsquo;s head to the ground and place on yours thecrown of your kingdom.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote said no more, and waited for the reply of the princess, whoaware of Don Fernando&rsquo;s determination to carry on the deception until DonQuixote had been conveyed to his home, with great ease of manner andgravity made answer, &ldquo;Whoever told you, valiant Knight of the RuefulCountenance, that I had undergone any change or transformation did nottell you the truth, for I am the same as I was yesterday. It is true thatcertain strokes of good fortune, that have given me more than I could havehoped for, have made some alteration in me; but I have not thereforeceased to be what I was before, or to entertain the same desire I have hadall through of availing myself of the might of your valiant and invinciblearm. And so, señor, let your goodness reinstate the father that begot mein your good opinion, and be assured that he was a wise and prudent man,since by his craft he found out such a sure and easy way of remedying mymisfortune; for I believe, señor, that had it not been for you I shouldnever have lit upon the good fortune I now possess; and in this I amsaying what is perfectly true; as most of these gentlemen who are presentcan fully testify. All that remains is to set out on our journeyto-morrow, for to-day we could not make much way; and for the rest of thehappy result I am looking forward to, I trust to God and the valour ofyour heart.&rdquo;</p><p>So said the sprightly Dorothea, and on hearing her Don Quixote turned toSancho, and said to him, with an angry air, &ldquo;I declare now, little Sancho,thou art the greatest little villain in Spain. Say, thief and vagabond,hast thou not just now told me that this princess had been turned into amaiden called Dorothea, and that the head which I am persuaded I cut offfrom a giant was the bitch that bore thee, and other nonsense that put mein the greatest perplexity I have ever been in all my life? I vow&rdquo; (andhere he looked to heaven and ground his teeth) &ldquo;I have a mind to play themischief with thee, in a way that will teach sense for the future to alllying squires of knights-errant in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let your worship be calm, señor,&rdquo; returned Sancho, &ldquo;for it may well bethat I have been mistaken as to the change of the lady princessMicomicona; but as to the giant&rsquo;s head, or at least as to the piercing ofthe wine-skins, and the blood being red wine, I make no mistake, as sureas there is a God; because the wounded skins are there at the head of yourworship&rsquo;s bed, and the wine has made a lake of the room; if not you willsee when the eggs come to be fried; I mean when his worship the landlordcalls for all the damages: for the rest, I am heartily glad that herladyship the queen is as she was, for it concerns me as much as anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I tell thee again, Sancho, thou art a fool,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;forgiveme, and that will do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Don Fernando; &ldquo;let us say no more about it; and asher ladyship the princess proposes to set out to-morrow because it is toolate to-day, so be it, and we will pass the night in pleasantconversation, and to-morrow we will all accompany Señor Don Quixote; forwe wish to witness the valiant and unparalleled achievements he is aboutto perform in the course of this mighty enterprise which he hasundertaken.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is I who shall wait upon and accompany you,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;and Iam much gratified by the favour that is bestowed upon me, and the goodopinion entertained of me, which I shall strive to justify or it shallcost me my life, or even more, if it can possibly cost me more.&rdquo;</p><p>Many were the compliments and expressions of politeness that passedbetween Don Quixote and Don Fernando; but they were brought to an end by atraveller who at this moment entered the inn, and who seemed from hisattire to be a Christian lately come from the country of the Moors, for hewas dressed in a short-skirted coat of blue cloth with half-sleeves andwithout a collar; his breeches were also of blue cloth, and his cap of thesame colour, and he wore yellow buskins and had a Moorish cutlass slungfrom a baldric across his breast. Behind him, mounted upon an ass, therecame a woman dressed in Moorish fashion, with her face veiled and a scarfon her head, and wearing a little brocaded cap, and a mantle that coveredher from her shoulders to her feet. The man was of a robust andwell-proportioned frame, in age a little over forty, rather swarthy incomplexion, with long moustaches and a full beard, and, in short, hisappearance was such that if he had been well dressed he would have beentaken for a person of quality and good birth. On entering he asked for aroom, and when they told him there was none in the inn he seemeddistressed, and approaching her who by her dress seemed to be a Moor, he tookher down from the saddle in his arms. Luscinda, Dorothea, the landlady, herdaughter and Maritornes, attracted by the strange, and to them entirelynew costume, gathered round her; and Dorothea, who was always kindly,courteous, and quick-witted, perceiving that both she and the man who hadbrought her were annoyed at not finding a room, said to her, &ldquo;Do not beput out, señora, by the discomfort and want of luxuries here, for it isthe way of road-side inns to be without them; still, if you will bepleased to share our lodging with us (pointing to Luscinda) perhaps youwill have found worse accommodation in the course of your journey.&rdquo;</p><p>To this the veiled lady made no reply; all she did was to rise from herseat, crossing her hands upon her bosom, bowing her head and bending herbody as a sign that she returned thanks. From her silence they concludedthat she must be a Moor and unable to speak a Christian tongue.</p><p>At this moment the captive came up, having been until now otherwiseengaged, and seeing that they all stood round his companion and that shemade no reply to what they addressed to her, he said, &ldquo;Ladies, this damselhardly understands my language and can speak none but that of her owncountry, for which reason she does not and cannot answer what has beenasked of her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing has been asked of her,&rdquo; returned Luscinda; &ldquo;she has only beenoffered our company for this evening and a share of the quarters weoccupy, where she shall be made as comfortable as the circumstances allow,with the good-will we are bound to show all strangers that stand in needof it, especially if it be a woman to whom the service is rendered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On her part and my own, señora,&rdquo; replied the captive, &ldquo;I kiss your hands,and I esteem highly, as I ought, the favour you have offered, which, onsuch an occasion and coming from persons of your appearance, is, it isplain to see, a very great one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, señor,&rdquo; said Dorothea, &ldquo;is this lady a Christian or a Moor? forher dress and her silence lead us to imagine that she is what we couldwish she was not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In dress and outwardly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she is a Moor, but at heart she is athoroughly good Christian, for she has the greatest desire to become one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then she has not been baptised?&rdquo; returned Luscinda.</p><p>&ldquo;There has been no opportunity for that,&rdquo; replied the captive, &ldquo;since sheleft Algiers, her native country and home; and up to the present she hasnot found herself in any such imminent danger of death as to make itnecessary to baptise her before she has been instructed in all theceremonies our holy mother Church ordains; but, please God, ere long sheshall be baptised with the solemnity befitting her which is higher thanher dress or mine indicates.&rdquo;</p><p>By these words he excited a desire in all who heard him, to know who theMoorish lady and the captive were, but no one liked to ask just then,seeing that it was a fitter moment for helping them to rest themselvesthan for questioning them about their lives. Dorothea took the Moorishlady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself, requested herto remove her veil. She looked at the captive as if to ask him what theymeant and what she was to do. He said to her in Arabic that they asked herto take off her veil, and thereupon she removed it and disclosed acountenance so lovely, that to Dorothea she seemed more beautiful thanLuscinda, and to Luscinda more beautiful than Dorothea, and all thebystanders felt that if any beauty could compare with theirs it was theMoorish lady&rsquo;s, and there were even those who were inclined to give itsomewhat the preference. And as it is the privilege and charm of beauty towin the heart and secure good-will, all forthwith became eager to showkindness and attention to the lovely Moor.</p><p>Don Fernando asked the captive what her name was, and he replied that itwas Lela Zoraida; but the instant she heard him, she guessed what theChristian had asked, and said hastily, with some displeasure and energy,&ldquo;No, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!&rdquo; giving them to understand that she wascalled &ldquo;Maria&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Zoraida.&rdquo; These words, and the touchingearnestness with which she uttered them, drew more than one tear from someof the listeners, particularly the women, who are by nature tender-heartedand compassionate. Luscinda embraced her affectionately, saying, &ldquo;Yes,yes, Maria, Maria,&rdquo; to which the Moor replied, &ldquo;Yes, yes, Maria; Zoraidamacange,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;not Zoraida.&rdquo;</p><p>Night was now approaching, and by the orders of those who accompanied DonFernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them thebest supper that was in his power. The hour therefore having arrived theyall took their seats at a long table like a refectory one, for round orsquare table there was none in the inn, and the seat of honour at the headof it, though he was for refusing it, they assigned to Don Quixote, whodesired the lady Micomicona to place herself by his side, as he was herprotector. Luscinda and Zoraida took their places next her, opposite tothem were Don Fernando and Cardenio, and next the captive and the othergentlemen, and by the side of the ladies, the curate and the barber. Andso they supped in high enjoyment, which was increased when they observedDon Quixote leave off eating, and, moved by an impulse like that whichmade him deliver himself at such length when he supped with the goatherds,begin to address them:</p><p>&ldquo;Verily, gentlemen, if we reflect upon it, great and marvellous are thethings they see, who make profession of the order of knight-errantry. Say,what being is there in this world, who entering the gate of this castle atthis moment, and seeing us as we are here, would suppose or imagine us tobe what we are? Who would say that this lady who is beside me was thegreat queen that we all know her to be, or that I am that Knight of theRueful Countenance, trumpeted far and wide by the mouth of Fame? Now,there can be no doubt that this art and calling surpasses all those thatmankind has invented, and is the more deserving of being held in honour inproportion as it is the more exposed to peril. Away with those who assertthat letters have the preeminence over arms; I will tell them, whosoeverthey may be, that they know not what they say. For the reason which suchpersons commonly assign, and upon which they chiefly rest, is, that thelabours of the mind are greater than those of the body, and that arms giveemployment to the body alone; as if the calling were a porter&rsquo;s trade, forwhich nothing more is required than sturdy strength; or as if, in what wewho profess them call arms, there were not included acts of vigour for theexecution of which high intelligence is requisite; or as if the soul ofthe warrior, when he has an army, or the defence of a city under his care,did not exert itself as much by mind as by body. Nay; see whether bybodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of theenemy, his plans, stratagems, or obstacles, or to ward off impendingmischief; for all these are the work of the mind, and in them the body hasno share whatever. Since, therefore, arms have need of the mind, as muchas letters, let us see now which of the two minds, that of the man ofletters or that of the warrior, has most to do; and this will be seen bythe end and goal that each seeks to attain; for that purpose is the moreestimable which has for its aim the nobler object. The end and goal ofletters&mdash;I am not speaking now of divine letters, the aim of which isto raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an end so infinite noother can be compared&mdash;I speak of human letters, the end of which isto establish distributive justice, give to every man that which is his,and see and take care that good laws are observed: an end undoubtedlynoble, lofty, and deserving of high praise, but not such as should begiven to that sought by arms, which have for their end and object peace,the greatest boon that men can desire in this life. The first good newsthe world and mankind received was that which the angels announced on thenight that was our day, when they sang in the air, &lsquo;Glory to God in thehighest, and peace on earth to men of good-will;&rsquo; and the salutation whichthe great Master of heaven and earth taught his disciples and chosenfollowers when they entered any house, was to say, &lsquo;Peace be on thishouse;&rsquo; and many other times he said to them, &lsquo;My peace I give unto you,my peace I leave you, peace be with you;&rsquo; a jewel and a precious giftgiven and left by such a hand: a jewel without which there can be nohappiness either on earth or in heaven. This peace is the true end of war;and war is only another name for arms. This, then, being admitted, thatthe end of war is peace, and that so far it has the advantage of the endof letters, let us turn to the bodily labours of the man of letters, andthose of him who follows the profession of arms, and see which are thegreater.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and in such correctlanguage, that for the time being he made it impossible for any of hishearers to consider him a madman; on the contrary, as they were mostlygentlemen, to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth, they listened to himwith great pleasure as he continued: &ldquo;Here, then, I say is what thestudent has to undergo; first of all poverty: not that all are poor, butto put the case as strongly as possible: and when I have said that heendures poverty, I think nothing more need be said about his hard fortune,for he who is poor has no share of the good things of life. This povertyhe suffers from in various ways, hunger, or cold, or nakedness, or alltogether; but for all that it is not so extreme but that he gets somethingto eat, though it may be at somewhat unseasonable hours and from theleavings of the rich; for the greatest misery of the student is what theythemselves call &lsquo;going out for soup,&rsquo; and there is always some neighbour&rsquo;sbrazier or hearth for them, which, if it does not warm, at least tempersthe cold to them, and lastly, they sleep comfortably at night under aroof. I will not go into other particulars, as for example want of shirts,and no superabundance of shoes, thin and threadbare garments, and gorgingthemselves to surfeit in their voracity when good luck has treated them toa banquet of some sort. By this road that I have described, rough andhard, stumbling here, falling there, getting up again to fall again, theyreach the rank they desire, and that once attained, we have seen many whohave passed these Syrtes and Scyllas and Charybdises, as if borne flyingon the wings of favouring fortune; we have seen them, I say, ruling andgoverning the world from a chair, their hunger turned into satiety, theircold into comfort, their nakedness into fine raiment, their sleep on a matinto repose in holland and damask, the justly earned reward of theirvirtue; but, contrasted and compared with what the warrior undergoes, allthey have undergone falls far short of it, as I am now about to show.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c37e" id="c37e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c37e.jpg (13K)" src="images/c37e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF THE CURIOUS DISCOURSE DON QUIXOTE DELIVERED ON ARMS ANDLETTERS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c38a" id="c38a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c38a.jpg (180K)" src="images/c38a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c38a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Continuing his discourse Don Quixote said: &ldquo;As we began in the student&rsquo;scase with poverty and its accompaniments, let us see now if the soldier isricher, and we shall find that in poverty itself there is no one poorer;for he is dependent on his miserable pay, which comes late or never, orelse on what he can plunder, seriously imperilling his life andconscience; and sometimes his nakedness will be so great that a slasheddoublet serves him for uniform and shirt, and in the depth of winter hehas to defend himself against the inclemency of the weather in the openfield with nothing better than the breath of his mouth, which I need notsay, coming from an empty place, must come out cold, contrary to the lawsof nature. To be sure he looks forward to the approach of night to make upfor all these discomforts on the bed that awaits him, which, unless bysome fault of his, never sins by being over narrow, for he can easilymeasure out on the ground as he likes, and roll himself about in it to hisheart&rsquo;s content without any fear of the sheets slipping away from him.Then, after all this, suppose the day and hour for taking his degree inhis calling to have come; suppose the day of battle to have arrived, whenthey invest him with the doctor&rsquo;s cap made of lint, to mend somebullet-hole, perhaps, that has gone through his temples, or left him witha crippled arm or leg. Or if this does not happen, and merciful Heavenwatches over him and keeps him safe and sound, it may be he will be in thesame poverty he was in before, and he must go through more engagements andmore battles, and come victorious out of all before he betters himself;but miracles of that sort are seldom seen. For tell me, sirs, if you haveever reflected upon it, by how much do those who have gained by war fallshort of the number of those who have perished in it? No doubt you willreply that there can be no comparison, that the dead cannot be numbered,while the living who have been rewarded may be summed up with threefigures. All which is the reverse in the case of men of letters; for byskirts, to say nothing of sleeves, they all find means of support; so thatthough the soldier has more to endure, his reward is much less. Butagainst all this it may be urged that it is easier to reward two thousandsoldiers, for the former may be remunerated by giving them places, whichmust perforce be conferred upon men of their calling, while the latter canonly be recompensed out of the very property of the master they serve; butthis impossibility only strengthens my argument.</p><p>&ldquo;Putting this, however, aside, for it is a puzzling question for which itis difficult to find a solution, let us return to the superiority of armsover letters, a matter still undecided, so many are the arguments putforward on each side; for besides those I have mentioned, letters say thatwithout them arms cannot maintain themselves, for war, too, has its lawsand is governed by them, and laws belong to the domain of letters and menof letters. To this arms make answer that without them laws cannot bemaintained, for by arms states are defended, kingdoms preserved, citiesprotected, roads made safe, seas cleared of pirates; and, in short, if itwere not for them, states, kingdoms, monarchies, cities, ways by sea andland would be exposed to the violence and confusion which war brings withit, so long as it lasts and is free to make use of its privileges andpowers. And then it is plain that whatever costs most is valued anddeserves to be valued most. To attain to eminence in letters costs a mantime, watching, hunger, nakedness, headaches, indigestions, and otherthings of the sort, some of which I have already referred to. But for aman to come in the ordinary course of things to be a good soldier costshim all the student suffers, and in an incomparably higher degree, for atevery step he runs the risk of losing his life. For what dread of want orpoverty that can reach or harass the student can compare with what thesoldier feels, who finds himself beleaguered in some stronghold mountingguard in some ravelin or cavalier, knows that the enemy is pushing a minetowards the post where he is stationed, and cannot under any circumstancesretire or fly from the imminent danger that threatens him? All he can dois to inform his captain of what is going on so that he may try to remedyit by a counter-mine, and then stand his ground in fear and expectation ofthe moment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descendinto the deep against his will. And if this seems a trifling risk, let ussee whether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleysstem to stem, in the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled one withthe other, when the soldier has no more standing room than two feet of theplank of the spur; and yet, though he sees before him threatening him asmany ministers of death as there are cannon of the foe pointed at him, nota lance length from his body, and sees too that with the first heedlessstep he will go down to visit the profundities of Neptune&rsquo;s bosom, stillwith dauntless heart, urged on by honour that nerves him, he makes himselfa target for all that musketry, and struggles to cross that narrow path tothe enemy&rsquo;s ship. And what is still more marvellous, no sooner has onegone down into the depths he will never rise from till the end of theworld, than another takes his place; and if he too falls into the sea thatwaits for him like an enemy, another and another will succeed him withouta moment&rsquo;s pause between their deaths: courage and daring the greatestthat all the chances of war can show. Happy the blest ages that knew notthe dread fury of those devilish engines of artillery, whose inventor I ampersuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention, bywhich he made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to take the life of agallant gentleman; and that, when he knows not how or whence, in theheight of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate brave hearts,there should come some random bullet, discharged perhaps by one who fledin terror at the flash when he fired off his accursed machine, which in aninstant puts an end to the projects and cuts off the life of one whodeserved to live for ages to come. And thus when I reflect on this, I amalmost tempted to say that in my heart I repent of having adopted thisprofession of knight-errant in so detestable an age as we live in now; forthough no peril can make me fear, still it gives me some uneasiness tothink that powder and lead may rob me of the opportunity of making myselffamous and renowned throughout the known earth by the might of my arm andthe edge of my sword. But Heaven&rsquo;s will be done; if I succeed in myattempt I shall be all the more honoured, as I have faced greater dangersthan the knights-errant of yore exposed themselves to.&rdquo;</p><p>All this lengthy discourse Don Quixote delivered while the others supped,forgetting to raise a morsel to his lips, though Sancho more than oncetold him to eat his supper, as he would have time enough afterwards to sayall he wanted. It excited fresh pity in those who had heard him to see aman of apparently sound sense, and with rational views on every subject hediscussed, so hopelessly wanting in all, when his wretched unluckychivalry was in question. The curate told him he was quite right in all hehad said in favour of arms, and that he himself, though a man of lettersand a graduate, was of the same opinion.</p><p>They finished their supper, the cloth was removed, and while the hostess, herdaughter, and Maritornes were getting Don Quixote of La Mancha&rsquo;s garretready, in which it was arranged that the women were to be quartered bythemselves for the night, Don Fernando begged the captive to tell them thestory of his life, for it could not fail to be strange and interesting, tojudge by the hints he had let fall on his arrival in company with Zoraida. Tothis the captive replied that he would very willingly yield to his request,only he feared his tale would not give them as much pleasure as he wished;nevertheless, not to be wanting in compliance, he would tell it. The curate andthe others thanked him and added their entreaties, and he finding himself sopressed said there was no occasion to ask, where a command had such weight, andadded, &ldquo;If your worships will give me your attention you will hear a truestory which, perhaps, fictitious ones constructed with ingenious and studiedart cannot come up to.&rdquo; These words made them settle themselves in theirplaces and preserve a deep silence, and he seeing them waiting on his words inmute expectation, began thus in a pleasant quiet voice.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c38e" id="c38e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c38e.jpg (18K)" src="images/c38e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch39" id="ch39"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br/>WHEREIN THE CAPTIVE RELATES HIS LIFE AND ADVENTURES</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c39a" id="c39a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c39a.jpg (137K)" src="images/c39a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c39a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>My family had its origin in a village in the mountains of Leon, and naturehad been kinder and more generous to it than fortune; though in thegeneral poverty of those communities my father passed for being even arich man; and he would have been so in reality had he been as clever inpreserving his property as he was in spending it. This tendency of his tobe liberal and profuse he had acquired from having been a soldier in hisyouth, for the soldier&rsquo;s life is a school in which the niggard becomesfree-handed and the free-handed prodigal; and if any soldiers are to befound who are misers, they are monsters of rare occurrence. My father wentbeyond liberality and bordered on prodigality, a disposition by no meansadvantageous to a married man who has children to succeed to his name andposition. My father had three, all sons, and all of sufficient age to makechoice of a profession. Finding, then, that he was unable to resist hispropensity, he resolved to divest himself of the instrument and cause ofhis prodigality and lavishness, to divest himself of wealth, without whichAlexander himself would have seemed parsimonious; and so calling us allthree aside one day into a room, he addressed us in words somewhat to thefollowing effect:</p><p>&ldquo;My sons, to assure you that I love you, no more need be known or saidthan that you are my sons; and to encourage a suspicion that I do not loveyou, no more is needed than the knowledge that I have no self-control asfar as preservation of your patrimony is concerned; therefore, that youmay for the future feel sure that I love you like a father, and have nowish to ruin you like a stepfather, I propose to do with you what I havefor some time back meditated, and after mature deliberation decided upon.You are now of an age to choose your line of life or at least make choiceof a calling that will bring you honour and profit when you are older; andwhat I have resolved to do is to divide my property into four parts; threeI will give to you, to each his portion without making any difference, andthe other I will retain to live upon and support myself for whateverremainder of life Heaven may be pleased to grant me. But I wish each ofyou on taking possession of the share that falls to him to follow one ofthe paths I shall indicate. In this Spain of ours there is a proverb, tomy mind very true&mdash;as they all are, being short aphorisms drawn fromlong practical experience&mdash;and the one I refer to says, &lsquo;The church,or the sea, or the king&rsquo;s house;&rsquo; as much as to say, in plainer language,whoever wants to flourish and become rich, let him follow the church, orgo to sea, adopting commerce as his calling, or go into the king&rsquo;s servicein his household, for they say, &lsquo;Better a king&rsquo;s crumb than a lord&rsquo;sfavour.&rsquo; I say so because it is my will and pleasure that one of youshould follow letters, another trade, and the third serve the king in thewars, for it is a difficult matter to gain admission to his service in hishousehold, and if war does not bring much wealth it confers greatdistinction and fame. Eight days hence I will give you your full shares inmoney, without defrauding you of a farthing, as you will see in the end.Now tell me if you are willing to follow out my idea and advice as I havelaid it before you.&rdquo;</p><p>Having called upon me as the eldest to answer, I, after urging him not tostrip himself of his property but to spend it all as he pleased, for wewere young men able to gain our living, consented to comply with hiswishes, and said that mine were to follow the profession of arms andthereby serve God and my king. My second brother having made the sameproposal, decided upon going to the Indies, embarking the portion thatfell to him in trade. The youngest, and in my opinion the wisest, said hewould rather follow the church, or go to complete his studies atSalamanca. As soon as we had come to an understanding, and made choice ofour professions, my father embraced us all, and in the short time hementioned carried into effect all he had promised; and when he had givento each his share, which as well as I remember was three thousand ducatsapiece in cash (for an uncle of ours bought the estate and paid for itdown, not to let it go out of the family), we all three on the same daytook leave of our good father; and at the same time, as it seemed to meinhuman to leave my father with such scanty means in his old age, Iinduced him to take two of my three thousand ducats, as the remainderwould be enough to provide me with all a soldier needed. My two brothers,moved by my example, gave him each a thousand ducats, so that there wasleft for my father four thousand ducats in money, besides three thousand,the value of the portion that fell to him which he preferred to retain inland instead of selling it. Finally, as I said, we took leave of him, andof our uncle whom I have mentioned, not without sorrow and tears on bothsides, they charging us to let them know whenever an opportunity offeredhow we fared, whether well or ill. We promised to do so, and when he hadembraced us and given us his blessing, one set out for Salamanca, theother for Seville, and I for Alicante, where I had heard there was aGenoese vessel taking in a cargo of wool for Genoa.</p><p>It is now some twenty-two years since I left my father&rsquo;s house, and allthat time, though I have written several letters, I have had no news whateverof him or of my brothers; my own adventures during that period I will nowrelate briefly. I embarked at Alicante, reached Genoa after a prosperousvoyage, and proceeded thence to Milan, where I provided myself with arms and afew soldier&rsquo;s accoutrements; thence it was my intention to go and takeservice in Piedmont, but as I was already on the road to Alessandria dellaPaglia, I learned that the great Duke of Alva was on his way to Flanders. Ichanged my plans, joined him, served under him in the campaigns he made, waspresent at the deaths of the Counts Egmont and Horn, and was promoted to beensign under a famous captain of Guadalajara, Diego de Urbina by name. Sometime after my arrival in Flanders news came of the league that his HolinessPope Pius V. of happy memory, had made with Venice and Spain against the commonenemy, the Turk, who had just then with his fleet taken the famous island ofCyprus, which belonged to the Venetians, a loss deplorable and disastrous. Itwas known as a fact that the Most Serene Don John of Austria, natural brotherof our good king Don Philip, was coming as commander-in-chief of the alliedforces, and rumours were abroad of the vast warlike preparations which werebeing made, all which stirred my heart and filled me with a longing to takepart in the campaign which was expected; and though I had reason to believe,and almost certain promises, that on the first opportunity that presenteditself I should be promoted to be captain, I preferred to leave all and betakemyself, as I did, to Italy; and it was my good fortune that Don John had justarrived at Genoa, and was going on to Naples to join the Venetian fleet, as heafterwards did at Messina. I may say, in short, that I took part in thatglorious expedition, promoted by this time to be a captain of infantry, towhich honourable charge my good luck rather than my merits raised me; and thatday&mdash;so fortunate for Christendom, because then all the nations of theearth were disabused of the error under which they lay in imagining the Turksto be invincible on sea&mdash;on that day, I say, on which the Ottoman prideand arrogance were broken, among all that were there made happy (for theChristians who died that day were happier than those who remained alive andvictorious) I alone was miserable; for, instead of some naval crown that Imight have expected had it been in Roman times, on the night that followed thatfamous day I found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles on my hands.</p><p>It happened in this way: El Uchali, the king of Algiers, a daring andsuccessful corsair, having attacked and taken the leading Maltese galley(only three knights being left alive in it, and they badly wounded), thechief galley of John Andrea, on board of which I and my company wereplaced, came to its relief, and doing as was bound to do in such a case, Ileaped on board the enemy&rsquo;s galley, which, sheering off from that whichhad attacked it, prevented my men from following me, and so I found myselfalone in the midst of my enemies, who were in such numbers that I wasunable to resist; in short I was taken, covered with wounds; El Uchali, asyou know, sirs, made his escape with his entire squadron, and I was left aprisoner in his power, the only sad being among so many filled with joy,and the only captive among so many free; for there were fifteen thousandChristians, all at the oar in the Turkish fleet, that regained theirlonged-for liberty that day.</p><p>They carried me to Constantinople, where the Grand Turk, Selim, made mymaster general at sea for having done his duty in the battle and carriedoff as evidence of his bravery the standard of the Order of Malta. Thefollowing year, which was the year seventy-two, I found myself at Navarinorowing in the leading galley with the three lanterns. There I saw andobserved how the opportunity of capturing the whole Turkish fleet inharbour was lost; for all the marines and janizzaries that belonged to itmade sure that they were about to be attacked inside the very harbour, andhad their kits and pasamaques, or shoes, ready to flee at once on shorewithout waiting to be assailed, in so great fear did they stand of ourfleet. But Heaven ordered it otherwise, not for any fault or neglect ofthe general who commanded on our side, but for the sins of Christendom,and because it was God&rsquo;s will and pleasure that we should always haveinstruments of punishment to chastise us. As it was, El Uchali took refugeat Modon, which is an island near Navarino, and landing forces fortifiedthe mouth of the harbour and waited quietly until Don John retired. Onthis expedition was taken the galley called the Prize, whose captain was ason of the famous corsair Barbarossa. It was taken by the chief Neapolitangalley called the She-wolf, commanded by that thunderbolt of war, thatfather of his men, that successful and unconquered captain Don Álvaro deBazan, Marquis of Santa Cruz; and I cannot help telling you what tookplace at the capture of the Prize.</p><p>The son of Barbarossa was so cruel, and treated his slaves so badly, that,when those who were at the oars saw that the She-wolf galley was bearingdown upon them and gaining upon them, they all at once dropped their oarsand seized their captain who stood on the stage at the end of the gangwayshouting to them to row lustily; and passing him on from bench to bench,from the poop to the prow, they so bit him that before he had got muchpast the mast his soul had already got to hell; so great, as I said, wasthe cruelty with which he treated them, and the hatred with which theyhated him.</p><p>We returned to Constantinople, and the following year, seventy-three, itbecame known that Don John had seized Tunis and taken the kingdom from theTurks, and placed Muley Hamet in possession, putting an end to the hopeswhich Muley Hamida, the cruelest and bravest Moor in the world,entertained of returning to reign there. The Grand Turk took the lossgreatly to heart, and with the cunning which all his race possess, he madepeace with the Venetians (who were much more eager for it than he was),and the following year, seventy-four, he attacked the Goletta and the fortwhich Don John had left half built near Tunis. While all these events wereoccurring, I was labouring at the oar without any hope of freedom; atleast I had no hope of obtaining it by ransom, for I was firmly resolvednot to write to my father telling him of my misfortunes. At length theGoletta fell, and the fort fell, before which places there wereseventy-five thousand regular Turkish soldiers, and more than four hundredthousand Moors and Arabs from all parts of Africa, and in the train of allthis great host such munitions and engines of war, and so many pioneersthat with their hands they might have covered the Goletta and the fortwith handfuls of earth. The first to fall was the Goletta, until thenreckoned impregnable, and it fell, not by any fault of its defenders, whodid all that they could and should have done, but because experimentproved how easily entrenchments could be made in the desert sand there;for water used to be found at two palms depth, while the Turks found noneat two yards; and so by means of a quantity of sandbags they raised theirworks so high that they commanded the walls of the fort, sweeping them asif from a cavalier, so that no one was able to make a stand or maintainthe defence.</p><p>It was a common opinion that our men should not have shut themselves up inthe Goletta, but should have waited in the open at the landing-place; butthose who say so talk at random and with little knowledge of such matters;for if in the Goletta and in the fort there were barely seven thousandsoldiers, how could such a small number, however resolute, sally out andhold their own against numbers like those of the enemy? And how is itpossible to help losing a stronghold that is not relieved, above all whensurrounded by a host of determined enemies in their own country? But manythought, and I thought so too, that it was special favour and mercy whichHeaven showed to Spain in permitting the destruction of that source andhiding place of mischief, that devourer, sponge, and moth of countlessmoney, fruitlessly wasted there to no other purpose save preserving thememory of its capture by the invincible Charles V.; as if to make thateternal, as it is and will be, these stones were needed to support it. Thefort also fell; but the Turks had to win it inch by inch, for the soldierswho defended it fought so gallantly and stoutly that the number of theenemy killed in twenty-two general assaults exceeded twenty-five thousand.Of three hundred that remained alive not one was taken unwounded, a clearand manifest proof of their gallantry and resolution, and how sturdilythey had defended themselves and held their post. A small fort or towerwhich was in the middle of the lagoon under the command of Don JuanZanoguera, a Valencian gentleman and a famous soldier, capitulated uponterms. They took prisoner Don Pedro Puertocarrero, commandant of theGoletta, who had done all in his power to defend his fortress, and tookthe loss of it so much to heart that he died of grief on the way toConstantinople, where they were carrying him a prisoner. They also tookthe commandant of the fort, Gabrio Cerbellon by name, a Milanesegentleman, a great engineer and a very brave soldier. In these twofortresses perished many persons of note, among whom was Pagano Doria,knight of the Order of St. John, a man of generous disposition, as wasshown by his extreme liberality to his brother, the famous John AndreaDoria; and what made his death the more sad was that he was slain by someArabs to whom, seeing that the fort was now lost, he entrusted himself,and who offered to conduct him in the disguise of a Moor to Tabarca, asmall fort or station on the coast held by the Genoese employed in thecoral fishery. These Arabs cut off his head and carried it to thecommander of the Turkish fleet, who proved on them the truth of ourCastilian proverb, that &ldquo;though the treason may please, the traitor ishated;&rdquo; for they say he ordered those who brought him the present to behanged for not having brought him alive.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c39b" id="c39b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c39b.jpg (371K)" src="images/c39b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c39b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Among the Christians who were taken in the fort was one named Don Pedro deAguilar, a native of some place, I know not what, in Andalusia, who hadbeen ensign in the fort, a soldier of great repute and rare intelligence,who had in particular a special gift for what they call poetry. I say sobecause his fate brought him to my galley and to my bench, and made him aslave to the same master; and before we left the port this gentlemancomposed two sonnets by way of epitaphs, one on the Goletta and the otheron the fort; indeed, I may as well repeat them, for I have them by heart,and I think they will be liked rather than disliked.</p><p>The instant the captive mentioned the name of Don Pedro de Aguilar, DonFernando looked at his companions and they all three smiled; and when hecame to speak of the sonnets one of them said, &ldquo;Before your worshipproceeds any further I entreat you to tell me what became of that DonPedro de Aguilar you have spoken of.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All I know is,&rdquo; replied the captive, &ldquo;that after having been inConstantinople two years, he escaped in the disguise of an Arnaut, incompany with a Greek spy; but whether he regained his liberty or not Icannot tell, though I fancy he did, because a year afterwards I saw theGreek at Constantinople, though I was unable to ask him what the result ofthe journey was.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, you are right,&rdquo; returned the gentleman, &ldquo;for that Don Pedro ismy brother, and he is now in our village in good health, rich, married,and with three children.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks be to God for all the mercies he has shown him,&rdquo; said the captive;&ldquo;for to my mind there is no happiness on earth to compare with recoveringlost liberty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what is more,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;I know the sonnets my brothermade.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then let your worship repeat them,&rdquo; said the captive, &ldquo;for you willrecite them better than I can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said the gentleman; &ldquo;that on the Goletta runs thus.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c39e" id="c39e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c39e.jpg (38K)" src="images/c39e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch40" id="ch40"></a>CHAPTER XL.<br/>IN WHICH THE STORY OF THE CAPTIVE IS CONTINUED.</h3><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c40a" id="c40a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c40a.jpg (131K)" src="images/c40a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c40a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p class="poem">SONNET<br/><br/>&ldquo;Blest souls, that, from this mortal husk set free,<br/>In guerdon of brave deeds beatified,<br/>Above this lowly orb of ours abide<br/>Made heirs of heaven and immortality,<br/>With noble rage and ardour glowing ye<br/>Your strength, while strength was yours, in battle plied,<br/>And with your own blood and the foeman&rsquo;s dyed<br/>The sandy soil and the encircling sea.<br/>It was the ebbing life-blood first that failed<br/>The weary arms; the stout hearts never quailed.<br/>Though vanquished, yet ye earned the victor&rsquo;s crown:<br/>Though mourned, yet still triumphant was your fall<br/>For there ye won, between the sword and wall,<br/>In Heaven glory and on earth renown.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;That is it exactly, according to my recollection,&rdquo; said the captive.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, that on the fort,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;if my memory servesme, goes thus:</p><p class="poem">SONNET<br/><br/>&ldquo;Up from this wasted soil, this shattered shell,<br/>Whose walls and towers here in ruin lie,<br/>Three thousand soldier souls took wing on high,<br/>In the bright mansions of the blest to dwell.<br/>The onslaught of the foeman to repel<br/>By might of arm all vainly did they try,<br/>And when at length &rsquo;twas left them but to die,<br/>Wearied and few the last defenders fell.<br/>And this same arid soil hath ever been<br/>A haunt of countless mournful memories,<br/>As well in our day as in days of yore.<br/>But never yet to Heaven it sent, I ween,<br/>From its hard bosom purer souls than these,<br/>Or braver bodies on its surface bore.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>The sonnets were not disliked, and the captive was rejoiced at the tidingsthey gave him of his comrade, and continuing his tale, he went on to say:</p><p>The Goletta and the fort being thus in their hands, the Turks gave ordersto dismantle the Goletta&mdash;for the fort was reduced to such a statethat there was nothing left to level&mdash;and to do the work more quicklyand easily they mined it in three places; but nowhere were they able toblow up the part which seemed to be the least strong, that is to say, theold walls, while all that remained standing of the new fortifications thatthe Fratin had made came to the ground with the greatest ease. Finally thefleet returned victorious and triumphant to Constantinople, and a fewmonths later died my master, El Uchali, otherwise Uchali Fartax, whichmeans in Turkish &ldquo;the scabby renegade;&rdquo; for that he was; it is thepractice with the Turks to name people from some defect or virtue they maypossess; the reason being that there are among them only four surnamesbelonging to families tracing their descent from the Ottoman house, andthe others, as I have said, take their names and surnames either frombodily blemishes or moral qualities. This &ldquo;scabby one&rdquo; rowed at the oar asa slave of the Grand Signor&rsquo;s for fourteen years, and when overthirty-four years of age, in resentment at having been struck by a Turkwhile at the oar, turned renegade and renounced his faith in order to beable to revenge himself; and such was his valour that, without owing hisadvancement to the base ways and means by which most favourites of theGrand Signor rise to power, he came to be king of Algiers, and afterwardsgeneral-on-sea, which is the third place of trust in the realm. He was aCalabrian by birth, and a worthy man morally, and he treated his slaveswith great humanity. He had three thousand of them, and after his deaththey were divided, as he directed by his will, between the Grand Signor(who is heir of all who die and shares with the children of the deceased)and his renegades. I fell to the lot of a Venetian renegade who, when acabin boy on board a ship, had been taken by Uchali and was so muchbeloved by him that he became one of his most favoured youths. He came tobe the most cruel renegade I ever saw: his name was Hassan Aga, and hegrew very rich and became king of Algiers. With him I went there fromConstantinople, rather glad to be so near Spain, not that I intended towrite to anyone about my unhappy lot, but to try if fortune would bekinder to me in Algiers than in Constantinople, where I had attempted in athousand ways to escape without ever finding a favourable time or chance;but in Algiers I resolved to seek for other means of effecting the purposeI cherished so dearly; for the hope of obtaining my liberty never desertedme; and when in my plots and schemes and attempts the result did notanswer my expectations, without giving way to despair I immediately beganto look out for or conjure up some new hope to support me, however faintor feeble it might be.</p><p>In this way I lived on immured in a building or prison called by the Turksa baño in which they confine the Christian captives, as well those thatare the king&rsquo;s as those belonging to private individuals, and also whatthey call those of the Almacen, which is as much as to say the slaves ofthe municipality, who serve the city in the public works and otheremployments; but captives of this kind recover their liberty with greatdifficulty, for, as they are public property and have no particularmaster, there is no one with whom to treat for their ransom, even thoughthey may have the means. To these baños, as I have said, some privateindividuals of the town are in the habit of bringing their captives,especially when they are to be ransomed; because there they can keep themin safety and comfort until their ransom arrives. The king&rsquo;s captivesalso, that are on ransom, do not go out to work with the rest of the crew,unless when their ransom is delayed; for then, to make them write for itmore pressingly, they compel them to work and go for wood, which is nolight labour.</p><p>I, however, was one of those on ransom, for when it was discovered that Iwas a captain, although I declared my scanty means and want of fortune,nothing could dissuade them from including me among the gentlemen andthose waiting to be ransomed. They put a chain on me, more as a mark ofthis than to keep me safe, and so I passed my life in that baño withseveral other gentlemen and persons of quality marked out as held toransom; but though at times, or rather almost always, we suffered fromhunger and scanty clothing, nothing distressed us so much as hearing andseeing at every turn the unexampled and unheard-of cruelties my masterinflicted upon the Christians. Every day he hanged a man, impaled one, cutoff the ears of another; and all with so little provocation, or soentirely without any, that the Turks acknowledged he did it merely for thesake of doing it, and because he was by nature murderously disposedtowards the whole human race. The only one that fared at all well with himwas a Spanish soldier, something de Saavedra by name, to whom he nevergave a blow himself, or ordered a blow to be given, or addressed a hardword, although he had done things that will dwell in the memory of thepeople there for many a year, and all to recover his liberty; and for theleast of the many things he did we all dreaded that he would be impaled,and he himself was in fear of it more than once; and only that time doesnot allow, I could tell you now something of what that soldier did, thatwould interest and astonish you much more than the narration of my owntale.</p><p>To go on with my story; the courtyard of our prison was overlooked by thewindows of the house belonging to a wealthy Moor of high position; andthese, as is usual in Moorish houses, were rather loopholes than windows,and besides were covered with thick and close lattice-work. It sohappened, then, that as I was one day on the terrace of our prison withthree other comrades, trying, to pass away the time, how far we could leapwith our chains, we being alone, for all the other Christians had gone outto work, I chanced to raise my eyes, and from one of these little closedwindows I saw a reed appear with a cloth attached to the end of it, and itkept waving to and fro, and moving as if making signs to us to come andtake it. We watched it, and one of those who were with me went and stoodunder the reed to see whether they would let it drop, or what they woulddo, but as he did so the reed was raised and moved from side to side, asif they meant to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; by a shake of the head. The Christian came back,and it was again lowered, making the same movements as before. Another ofmy comrades went, and with him the same happened as with the first, andthen the third went forward, but with the same result as the first andsecond. Seeing this I did not like not to try my luck, and as soon as Icame under the reed it was dropped and fell inside the baño at my feet. Ihastened to untie the cloth, in which I perceived a knot, and in this wereten cianis, which are coins of base gold, current among the Moors, andeach worth ten reals of our money.</p><p>It is needless to say I rejoiced over this godsend, and my joy was notless than my wonder as I strove to imagine how this good fortune couldhave come to us, but to me specially; for the evident unwillingness todrop the reed for any but me showed that it was for me the favour wasintended. I took my welcome money, broke the reed, and returned to theterrace, and looking up at the window, I saw a very white hand put outthat opened and shut very quickly. From this we gathered or fancied thatit must be some woman living in that house that had done us this kindness,and to show that we were grateful for it, we made salaams after thefashion of the Moors, bowing the head, bending the body, and crossing thearms on the breast. Shortly afterwards at the same window a small crossmade of reeds was put out and immediately withdrawn. This sign led us tobelieve that some Christian woman was a captive in the house, and that itwas she who had been so good to us; but the whiteness of the hand and thebracelets we had perceived made us dismiss that idea, though we thought itmight be one of the Christian renegades whom their masters very often takeas lawful wives, and gladly, for they prefer them to the women of theirown nation. In all our conjectures we were wide of the truth; so from thattime forward our sole occupation was watching and gazing at the windowwhere the cross had appeared to us, as if it were our pole-star; but atleast fifteen days passed without our seeing either it or the hand, or anyother sign and though meanwhile we endeavoured with the utmost pains toascertain who it was that lived in the house, and whether there were anyChristian renegade in it, nobody could ever tell us anything more thanthat he who lived there was a rich Moor of high position, Hadji Morato byname, formerly alcaide of La Pata, an office of high dignity among them.But when we least thought it was going to rain any more cianis from thatquarter, we saw the reed suddenly appear with another cloth tied in alarger knot attached to it, and this at a time when, as on the formeroccasion, the baño was deserted and unoccupied.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c40b" id="c40b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c40b.jpg (288K)" src="images/c40b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c40b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>We made trial as before, each of the same three going forward before Idid; but the reed was delivered to none but me, and on my approach it waslet drop. I untied the knot and I found forty Spanish gold crowns with apaper written in Arabic, and at the end of the writing there was a largecross drawn. I kissed the cross, took the crowns and returned to theterrace, and we all made our salaams; again the hand appeared, I madesigns that I would read the paper, and then the window was closed. We wereall puzzled, though filled with joy at what had taken place; and as noneof us understood Arabic, great was our curiosity to know what the papercontained, and still greater the difficulty of finding someone to readit. At last I resolved to confide in a renegade, a native of Murcia, whoprofessed a very great friendship for me, and had given pledges that boundhim to keep any secret I might entrust to him; for it is the custom withsome renegades, when they intend to return to Christian territory, tocarry about them certificates from captives of mark testifying, inwhatever form they can, that such and such a renegade is a worthy man whohas always shown kindness to Christians, and is anxious to escape on thefirst opportunity that may present itself. Some obtain these testimonialswith good intentions, others put them to a cunning use; for when they goto pillage on Christian territory, if they chance to be cast away, ortaken prisoners, they produce their certificates and say that from thesepapers may be seen the object they came for, which was to remain onChristian ground, and that it was to this end they joined the Turks intheir foray. In this way they escape the consequences of the firstoutburst and make their peace with the Church before it does them anyharm, and then when they have the chance they return to Barbary to becomewhat they were before. Others, however, there are who procure these papersand make use of them honestly, and remain on Christian soil. This friendof mine, then, was one of these renegades that I have described; he hadcertificates from all our comrades, in which we testified in his favour asstrongly as we could; and if the Moors had found the papers they wouldhave burned him alive.</p><p>I knew that he understood Arabic very well, and could not only speak butalso write it; but before I disclosed the whole matter to him, I asked himto read for me this paper which I had found by accident in a hole in mycell. He opened it and remained some time examining it and muttering tohimself as he translated it. I asked him if he understood it, and he toldme he did perfectly well, and that if I wished him to tell me its meaningword for word, I must give him pen and ink that he might do it moresatisfactorily. We at once gave him what he required, and he set abouttranslating it bit by bit, and when he had done he said:</p><p>&ldquo;All that is here in Spanish is what the Moorish paper contains, and youmust bear in mind that when it says &lsquo;Lela Marien&rsquo; it means &lsquo;Our Lady theVirgin Mary.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>We read the paper and it ran thus:</p><p>&ldquo;When I was a child my father had a slave who taught me to pray theChristian prayer in my own language, and told me many things about LelaMarien. The Christian died, and I know that she did not go to the fire,but to Allah, because since then I have seen her twice, and she told me togo to the land of the Christians to see Lela Marien, who had great lovefor me. I know not how to go. I have seen many Christians, but exceptthyself none has seemed to me to be a gentleman. I am young and beautiful,and have plenty of money to take with me. See if thou canst contrive howwe may go, and if thou wilt thou shalt be my husband there, and if thouwilt not it will not distress me, for Lela Marien will find me someone tomarry me. I myself have written this: have a care to whom thou givest itto read: trust no Moor, for they are all perfidious. I am greatly troubledon this account, for I would not have thee confide in anyone, because ifmy father knew it he would at once fling me down a well and cover me withstones. I will put a thread to the reed; tie the answer to it, and if thouhast no one to write for thee in Arabic, tell it to me by signs, for LelaMarien will make me understand thee. She and Allah and this cross, which Ioften kiss as the captive bade me, protect thee.&rdquo;</p><p>Judge, sirs, whether we had reason for surprise and joy at the words ofthis paper; and both one and the other were so great, that the renegadeperceived that the paper had not been found by chance, but had been inreality addressed to someone of us, and he begged us, if what hesuspected were the truth, to trust him and tell him all, for he would riskhis life for our freedom; and so saying he took out from his breast ametal crucifix, and with many tears swore by the God the imagerepresented, in whom, sinful and wicked as he was, he truly and faithfullybelieved, to be loyal to us and keep secret whatever we chose to reveal tohim; for he thought and almost foresaw that by means of her who hadwritten that paper, he and all of us would obtain our liberty, and hehimself obtain the object he so much desired, his restoration to the bosomof the Holy Mother Church, from which by his own sin and ignorance he wasnow severed like a corrupt limb. The renegade said this with so many tearsand such signs of repentance, that with one consent we all agreed to tellhim the whole truth of the matter, and so we gave him a full account ofall, without hiding anything from him. We pointed out to him the window atwhich the reed appeared, and he by that means took note of the house, andresolved to ascertain with particular care who lived in it. We agreed alsothat it would be advisable to answer the Moorish lady&rsquo;s letter, and therenegade without a moment&rsquo;s delay took down the words I dictated to him,which were exactly what I shall tell you, for nothing of importance thattook place in this affair has escaped my memory, or ever will while lifelasts. This, then, was the answer returned to the Moorish lady:</p><p>&ldquo;The true Allah protect thee, Lady, and that blessed Marien who is thetrue mother of God, and who has put it into thy heart to go to the land ofthe Christians, because she loves thee. Entreat her that she be pleased toshow thee how thou canst execute the command she gives thee, for she will,such is her goodness. On my own part, and on that of all these Christianswho are with me, I promise to do all that we can for thee, even to death.Fail not to write to me and inform me what thou dost mean to do, and Iwill always answer thee; for the great Allah has given us a Christiancaptive who can speak and write thy language well, as thou mayest see bythis paper; without fear, therefore, thou canst inform us of all thouwouldst. As to what thou sayest, that if thou dost reach the land of theChristians thou wilt be my wife, I give thee my promise upon it as a goodChristian; and know that the Christians keep their promises better thanthe Moors. Allah and Marien his mother watch over thee, my Lady.&rdquo;</p><p>The paper being written and folded I waited two days until the baño wasempty as before, and immediately repaired to the usual walk on the terraceto see if there were any sign of the reed, which was not long in makingits appearance. As soon as I saw it, although I could not distinguish whoput it out, I showed the paper as a sign to attach the thread, but it wasalready fixed to the reed, and to it I tied the paper; and shortlyafterwards our star once more made its appearance with the white flag ofpeace, the little bundle. It was dropped, and I picked it up, and found inthe cloth, in gold and silver coins of all sorts, more than fifty crowns,which fifty times more strengthened our joy and doubled our hope ofgaining our liberty. That very night our renegade returned and said he hadlearned that the Moor we had been told of lived in that house, that hisname was Hadji Morato, that he was enormously rich, that he had one onlydaughter the heiress of all his wealth, and that it was the generalopinion throughout the city that she was the most beautiful woman inBarbary, and that several of the viceroys who came there had sought herfor a wife, but that she had been always unwilling to marry; and he hadlearned, moreover, that she had a Christian slave who was now dead; allwhich agreed with the contents of the paper. We immediately took counselwith the renegade as to what means would have to be adopted in order tocarry off the Moorish lady and bring us all to Christian territory; and inthe end it was agreed that for the present we should wait for a secondcommunication from Zoraida (for that was the name of her who now desiresto be called Maria), because we saw clearly that she and no one else couldfind a way out of all these difficulties. When we had decided upon thisthe renegade told us not to be uneasy, for he would lose his life orrestore us to liberty. For four days the baño was filled with people, forwhich reason the reed delayed its appearance for four days, but at the endof that time, when the baño was, as it generally was, empty, it appearedwith the cloth so bulky that it promised a happy birth. Reed and clothcame down to me, and I found another paper and a hundred crowns in gold,without any other coin. The renegade was present, and in our cell we gavehim the paper to read, which was to this effect:</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot think of a plan, señor, for our going to Spain, nor has LelaMarien shown me one, though I have asked her. All that can be done is forme to give you plenty of money in gold from this window. With it ransomyourself and your friends, and let one of you go to the land of theChristians, and there buy a vessel and come back for the others; and hewill find me in my father&rsquo;s garden, which is at the Babazon gate near theseashore, where I shall be all this summer with my father and my servants.You can carry me away from there by night without any danger, and bring meto the vessel. And remember thou art to be my husband, else I will pray toMarien to punish thee. If thou canst not trust anyone to go for thevessel, ransom thyself and do thou go, for I know thou wilt return moresurely than any other, as thou art a gentleman and a Christian. Endeavourto make thyself acquainted with the garden; and when I see thee walkingyonder I shall know that the baño is empty and I will give thee abundanceof money. Allah protect thee, señor.&rdquo;</p><p>These were the words and contents of the second paper, and on hearingthem, each declared himself willing to be the ransomed one, and promisedto go and return with scrupulous good faith; and I too made the sameoffer; but to all this the renegade objected, saying that he would not onany account consent to one being set free before all went together, asexperience had taught him how ill those who have been set free keeppromises which they made in captivity; for captives of distinctionfrequently had recourse to this plan, paying the ransom of one who was togo to Valencia or Majorca with money to enable him to arm a bark andreturn for the others who had ransomed him, but who never came back; forrecovered liberty and the dread of losing it again efface from the memoryall the obligations in the world. And to prove the truth of what he said,he told us briefly what had happened to a certain Christian gentlemanalmost at that very time, the strangest case that had ever occurred eventhere, where astonishing and marvellous things are happening everyinstant. In short, he ended by saying that what could and ought to be donewas to give the money intended for the ransom of one of us Christians tohim, so that he might with it buy a vessel there in Algiers under thepretence of becoming a merchant and trader at Tetuan and along the coast;and when master of the vessel, it would be easy for him to hit on some wayof getting us all out of the baño and putting us on board; especially ifthe Moorish lady gave, as she said, money enough to ransom all, becauseonce free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us to embark evenin open day; but the greatest difficulty was that the Moors do not allowany renegade to buy or own any craft, unless it be a large vessel forgoing on roving expeditions, because they are afraid that anyone who buysa small vessel, especially if he be a Spaniard, only wants it for thepurpose of escaping to Christian territory. This however he could get overby arranging with a Tagarin Moor to go shares with him in the purchase ofthe vessel, and in the profit on the cargo; and under cover of this hecould become master of the vessel, in which case he looked upon all therest as accomplished. But though to me and my comrades it had seemed abetter plan to send to Majorca for the vessel, as the Moorish ladysuggested, we did not dare to oppose him, fearing that if we did not do ashe said he would denounce us, and place us in danger of losing all ourlives if he were to disclose our dealings with Zoraida, for whose life wewould have all given our own. We therefore resolved to put ourselves inthe hands of God and in the renegade&rsquo;s; and at the same time an answer wasgiven to Zoraida, telling her that we would do all she recommended, forshe had given as good advice as if Lela Marien had delivered it, and thatit depended on her alone whether we were to defer the business or put itin execution at once. I renewed my promise to be her husband; and thus thenext day that the baño chanced to be empty she at different times gave usby means of the reed and cloth two thousand gold crowns and a paper inwhich she said that the next Juma, that is to say Friday, she was going toher father&rsquo;s garden, but that before she went she would give us moremoney; and if it were not enough we were to let her know, as she wouldgive us as much as we asked, for her father had so much he would not missit, and besides she kept all the keys.</p><p>We at once gave the renegade five hundred crowns to buy the vessel, andwith eight hundred I ransomed myself, giving the money to a Valencianmerchant who happened to be in Algiers at the time, and who had mereleased on his word, pledging it that on the arrival of the first shipfrom Valencia he would pay my ransom; for if he had given the money atonce it would have made the king suspect that my ransom money had been fora long time in Algiers, and that the merchant had for his own advantagekept it secret. In fact my master was so difficult to deal with that Idared not on any account pay down the money at once. The Thursday beforethe Friday on which the fair Zoraida was to go to the garden she gave us athousand crowns more, and warned us of her departure, begging me, if Iwere ransomed, to find out her father&rsquo;s garden at once, and by all meansto seek an opportunity of going there to see her. I answered in a fewwords that I would do so, and that she must remember to commend us to LelaMarien with all the prayers the captive had taught her. This having beendone, steps were taken to ransom our three comrades, so as to enable themto quit the baño, and lest, seeing me ransomed and themselves not, thoughthe money was forthcoming, they should make a disturbance about it and thedevil should prompt them to do something that might injure Zoraida; forthough their position might be sufficient to relieve me from thisapprehension, nevertheless I was unwilling to run any risk in the matter;and so I had them ransomed in the same way as I was, handing over all themoney to the merchant so that he might with safety and confidence givesecurity; without, however, confiding our arrangement and secret to him,which might have been dangerous.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c40e" id="c40e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c40e.jpg (34K)" src="images/c40e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch41" id="ch41"></a>CHAPTER XLI.<br/>IN WHICH THE CAPTIVE STILL CONTINUES HIS ADVENTURES</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c41a" id="c41a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c41a.jpg (106K)" src="images/c41a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c41a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Before fifteen days were over our renegade had already purchased an excellentvessel with room for more than thirty persons; and to make the transaction safeand lend a colour to it, he thought it well to make, as he did, a voyage to aplace called Shershel, twenty leagues from Algiers on the Oran side, wherethere is an extensive trade in dried figs. Two or three times he made thisvoyage in company with the Tagarin already mentioned. The Moors of Aragon arecalled Tagarins in Barbary, and those of Granada Mudéjares; but in the Kingdomof Fez they call the Mudéjares Elches, and they are the people the king chieflyemploys in war. To proceed: every time he passed with his vessel he anchored ina cove that was not two crossbow shots from the garden where Zoraida waswaiting; and there the renegade, together with the two Moorish lads that rowed,used purposely to station himself, either going through his prayers, or elsepractising as a part what he meant to perform in earnest. And thus he would goto Zoraida&rsquo;s garden and ask for fruit, which her father gave him, notknowing him; but though, as he afterwards told me, he sought to speak toZoraida, and tell her who he was, and that by my orders he was to take her tothe land of the Christians, so that she might feel satisfied and easy, he hadnever been able to do so; for the Moorish women do not allow themselves to beseen by any Moor or Turk, unless their husband or father bid them: withChristian captives they permit freedom of intercourse and communication, evenmore than might be considered proper. But for my part I should have been sorryif he had spoken to her, for perhaps it might have alarmed her to find heraffairs talked of by renegades. But God, who ordered it otherwise, afforded noopportunity for our renegade&rsquo;s well-meant purpose; and he, seeing howsafely he could go to Shershel and return, and anchor when and how and where heliked, and that the Tagarin his partner had no will but his, and that, now Iwas ransomed, all we wanted was to find some Christians to row, told me to lookout for any I should be willing to take with me, over and above those who hadbeen ransomed, and to engage them for the next Friday, which he fixed upon forour departure. On this I spoke to twelve Spaniards, all stout rowers, and suchas could most easily leave the city; but it was no easy matter to find so manyjust then, because there were twenty ships out on a cruise and they had takenall the rowers with them; and these would not have been found were it not thattheir master remained at home that summer without going to sea in order tofinish a galliot that he had upon the stocks. To these men I said nothing morethan that the next Friday in the evening they were to come out stealthily oneby one and hang about Hadji Morato&rsquo;s garden, waiting for me there until Icame. These directions I gave each one separately, with orders that if they sawany other Christians there they were not to say anything to them except that Ihad directed them to wait at that spot.</p><p>This preliminary having been settled, another still more necessary step had tobe taken, which was to let Zoraida know how matters stood that she might beprepared and forewarned, so as not to be taken by surprise if we were suddenlyto seize upon her before she thought the Christians&rsquo; vessel could havereturned. I determined, therefore, to go to the garden and try if I could speakto her; and the day before my departure I went there under the pretence ofgathering herbs. The first person I met was her father, who addressed me in thelanguage that all over Barbary and even in Constantinople is the medium betweencaptives and Moors, and is neither Morisco nor Castilian, nor of any othernation, but a mixture of all languages, by means of which we can all understandone another. In this sort of language, I say, he asked me what I wanted in hisgarden, and to whom I belonged. I replied that I was a slave of the Arnaut Mami(for I knew as a certainty that he was a very great friend of his), and that Iwanted some herbs to make a salad. He asked me then whether I were on ransom ornot, and what my master demanded for me. While these questions and answers wereproceeding, the fair Zoraida, who had already perceived me some time before,came out of the house in the garden, and as Moorish women are by no meansparticular about letting themselves be seen by Christians, or, as I have saidbefore, at all coy, she had no hesitation in coming to where her father stoodwith me; moreover her father, seeing her approaching slowly, called to her tocome. It would be beyond my power now to describe to you the great beauty, thehigh-bred air, the brilliant attire of my beloved Zoraida as she presentedherself before my eyes. I will content myself with saying that more pearls hungfrom her fair neck, her ears, and her hair than she had hairs on her head. Onher ankles, which as is customary were bare, she had carcajes (for so braceletsor anklets are called in Morisco) of the purest gold, set with so many diamondsthat she told me afterwards her father valued them at ten thousand doubloons,and those she had on her wrists were worth as much more. The pearls were inprofusion and very fine, for the highest display and adornment of the Moorishwomen is decking themselves with rich pearls and seed-pearls; and of thesethere are therefore more among the Moors than among any other people.Zoraida&rsquo;s father had to the reputation of possessing a great number, andthe purest in all Algiers, and of possessing also more than two hundredthousand Spanish crowns; and she, who is now mistress of me only, was mistressof all this. Whether thus adorned she would have been beautiful or not, andwhat she must have been in her prosperity, may be imagined from the beautyremaining to her after so many hardships; for, as everyone knows, the beauty ofsome women has its times and its seasons, and is increased or diminished bychance causes; and naturally the emotions of the mind will heighten or impairit, though indeed more frequently they totally destroy it. In a word shepresented herself before me that day attired with the utmost splendour, andsupremely beautiful; at any rate, she seemed to me the most beautiful object Ihad ever seen; and when, besides, I thought of all I owed to her I felt asthough I had before me some heavenly being come to earth to bring me relief andhappiness.</p><p>As she approached her father told her in his own language that I was acaptive belonging to his friend the Arnaut Mami, and that I had come forsalad.</p><p>She took up the conversation, and in that mixture of tongues I have spokenof she asked me if I was a gentleman, and why I was not ransomed.</p><p>I answered that I was already ransomed, and that by the price it might beseen what value my master set on me, as they had given one thousand fivehundred zoltanis for me; to which she replied, &ldquo;Hadst thou been myfather&rsquo;s, I can tell thee, I would not have let him part with thee fortwice as much, for you Christians always tell lies about yourselves andmake yourselves out poor to cheat the Moors.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That may be, lady,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but indeed I dealt truthfully with mymaster, as I do and mean to do with everybody in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And when dost thou go?&rdquo; said Zoraida.</p><p>&ldquo;To-morrow, I think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for there is a vessel here from Francewhich sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would it not be better,&rdquo; said Zoraida, &ldquo;to wait for the arrival of shipsfrom Spain and go with them and not with the French who are not yourfriends?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;though if there were intelligence that a vessel were nowcoming from Spain it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, it ismore likely I shall depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel to return tomy country and to those I love is so great that it will not allow me towait for another opportunity, however more convenient, if it be delayed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No doubt thou art married in thine own country,&rdquo; said Zoraida, &ldquo;and forthat reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not married,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I have given my promise to marry on myarrival there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it?&rdquo; said Zoraida.</p><p>&ldquo;So beautiful,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that, to describe her worthily and tell thee thetruth, she is very like thee.&rdquo;</p><p>At this her father laughed very heartily and said, &ldquo;By Allah, Christian,she must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter, who is the mostbeautiful woman in all this kingdom: only look at her well and thou wiltsee I am telling the truth.&rdquo;</p><p>Zoraida&rsquo;s father as the better linguist helped to interpret most of thesewords and phrases, for though she spoke the bastard language, that, as Ihave said, is employed there, she expressed her meaning more by signs thanby words.</p><p>While we were still engaged in this conversation, a Moor came running up,exclaiming that four Turks had leaped over the fence or wall of thegarden, and were gathering the fruit though it was not yet ripe. The oldman was alarmed and Zoraida too, for the Moors commonly, and, so to speak,instinctively have a dread of the Turks, but particularly of the soldiers,who are so insolent and domineering to the Moors who are under their powerthat they treat them worse than if they were their slaves. Her father saidto Zoraida, &ldquo;Daughter, retire into the house and shut thyself in while Igo and speak to these dogs; and thou, Christian, pick thy herbs, and go inpeace, and Allah bring thee safe to thy own country.&rdquo;</p><p>I bowed, and he went away to look for the Turks, leaving me alone withZoraida, who made as if she were about to retire as her father bade her;but the moment he was concealed by the trees of the garden, turning to mewith her eyes full of tears she said, &ldquo;Tameji, cristiano, tameji?&rdquo; that isto say, &ldquo;Art thou going, Christian, art thou going?&rdquo;</p><p>I made answer, &ldquo;Yes, lady, but not without thee, come what may: be on thewatch for me on the next Juma, and be not alarmed when thou seest us; formost surely we shall go to the land of the Christians.&rdquo;</p><p>This I said in such a way that she understood perfectly all that passed betweenus, and throwing her arm round my neck she began with feeble steps to movetowards the house; but as fate would have it (and it might have been veryunfortunate if Heaven had not otherwise ordered it), just as we were moving onin the manner and position I have described, with her arm round my neck, herfather, as he returned after having sent away the Turks, saw how we werewalking and we perceived that he saw us; but Zoraida, ready and quickwitted,took care not to remove her arm from my neck, but on the contrary drew closerto me and laid her head on my breast, bending her knees a little and showingall the signs and tokens of fainting, while I at the same time made it seem asthough I were supporting her against my will. Her father came running up towhere we were, and seeing his daughter in this state asked what was the matterwith her; she, however, giving no answer, he said, &ldquo;No doubt she hasfainted in alarm at the entrance of those dogs,&rdquo; and taking her from minehe drew her to his own breast, while she sighing, her eyes still wet withtears, said again, &ldquo;Ameji, cristiano, ameji&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Go,Christian, go.&rdquo; To this her father replied, &ldquo;There is no need,daughter, for the Christian to go, for he has done thee no harm, and the Turkshave now gone; feel no alarm, there is nothing to hurt thee, for as I say, theTurks at my request have gone back the way they came.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c41b" id="c41b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c41b.jpg (320K)" src="images/c41b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c41b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;It was they who terrified her, as thou hast said, señor,&rdquo; said I to herfather; &ldquo;but since she tells me to go, I have no wish to displease her:peace be with thee, and with thy leave I will come back to this garden forherbs if need be, for my master says there are nowhere better herbs forsalad than here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come back for any thou hast need of,&rdquo; replied Hadji Morato; &ldquo;for mydaughter does not speak thus because she is displeased with thee or anyChristian: she only meant that the Turks should go, not thou; or that itwas time for thee to look for thy herbs.&rdquo;</p><p>With this I at once took my leave of both; and she, looking as though herheart were breaking, retired with her father. While pretending to look forherbs I made the round of the garden at my ease, and studied carefully allthe approaches and outlets, and the fastenings of the house and everythingthat could be taken advantage of to make our task easy.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c41c" id="c41c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c41c.jpg (326K)" src="images/c41c.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c41c.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Having done so I went and gave an account of all that had taken place tothe renegade and my comrades, and looked forward with impatience to thehour when, all fear at an end, I should find myself in possession of theprize which fortune held out to me in the fair and lovely Zoraida. Thetime passed at length, and the appointed day we so longed for arrived;and, all following out the arrangement and plan which, after carefulconsideration and many a long discussion, we had decided upon, wesucceeded as fully as we could have wished; for on the Friday followingthe day upon which I spoke to Zoraida in the garden, the renegade anchoredhis vessel at nightfall almost opposite the spot where she was. TheChristians who were to row were ready and in hiding in different placesround about, all waiting for me, anxious and elated, and eager to attackthe vessel they had before their eyes; for they did not know therenegade&rsquo;s plan, but expected that they were to gain their liberty byforce of arms and by killing the Moors who were on board the vessel. Assoon, then, as I and my comrades made our appearance, all those that werein hiding seeing us came and joined us. It was now the time when the citygates are shut, and there was no one to be seen in all the space outside.When we were collected together we debated whether it would be betterfirst to go for Zoraida, or to make prisoners of the Moorish rowers whorowed in the vessel; but while we were still uncertain our renegade cameup asking us what kept us, as it was now the time, and all the Moors wereoff their guard and most of them asleep. We told him why we hesitated, buthe said it was of more importance first to secure the vessel, which couldbe done with the greatest ease and without any danger, and then we couldgo for Zoraida. We all approved of what he said, and so without furtherdelay, guided by him we made for the vessel, and he leaping on boardfirst, drew his cutlass and said in Morisco, &ldquo;Let no one stir from this ifhe does not want it to cost him his life.&rdquo; By this almost all theChristians were on board, and the Moors, who were fainthearted, hearingtheir captain speak in this way, were cowed, and without any one of themtaking to his arms (and indeed they had few or hardly any) they submittedwithout saying a word to be bound by the Christians, who quickly securedthem, threatening them that if they raised any kind of outcry they wouldbe all put to the sword. This having been accomplished, and half of ourparty being left to keep guard over them, the rest of us, again taking therenegade as our guide, hastened towards Hadji Morato&rsquo;s garden, and as goodluck would have it, on trying the gate it opened as easily as if it hadnot been locked; and so, quite quietly and in silence, we reached thehouse without being perceived by anybody. The lovely Zoraida was watchingfor us at a window, and as soon as she perceived that there were peoplethere, she asked in a low voice if we were &ldquo;Nizarani,&rdquo; as much as to sayor ask if we were Christians. I answered that we were, and begged her tocome down. As soon as she recognised me she did not delay an instant, butwithout answering a word came down immediately, opened the door andpresented herself before us all, so beautiful and so richly attired that Icannot attempt to describe her. The moment I saw her I took her hand andkissed it, and the renegade and my two comrades did the same; and therest, who knew nothing of the circumstances, did as they saw us do, for itonly seemed as if we were returning thanks to her, and recognising her asthe giver of our liberty. The renegade asked her in the Morisco languageif her father was in the house. She replied that he was and that he wasasleep.</p><p>&ldquo;Then it will be necessary to waken him and take him with us,&rdquo; said therenegade, &ldquo;and everything of value in this fair mansion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;my father must not on any account be touched, and thereis nothing in the house except what I shall take, and that will be quiteenough to enrich and satisfy all of you; wait a little and you shall see,&rdquo;and so saying she went in, telling us she would return immediately andbidding us keep quiet without making any noise.</p><p>I asked the renegade what had passed between them, and when he told me, Ideclared that nothing should be done except in accordance with the wishesof Zoraida, who now came back with a little trunk so full of gold crownsthat she could scarcely carry it. Unfortunately her father awoke whilethis was going on, and hearing a noise in the garden, came to the window,and at once perceiving that all those who were there were Christians,raising a prodigiously loud outcry, he began to call out in Arabic,&ldquo;Christians, Christians! thieves, thieves!&rdquo; by which cries we were allthrown into the greatest fear and embarrassment; but the renegade seeingthe danger we were in and how important it was for him to effect hispurpose before we were heard, mounted with the utmost quickness to whereHadji Morato was, and with him went some of our party; I, however, did notdare to leave Zoraida, who had fallen almost fainting in my arms. To bebrief, those who had gone upstairs acted so promptly that in an instantthey came down, carrying Hadji Morato with his hands bound and a napkintied over his mouth, which prevented him from uttering a word, warning himat the same time that to attempt to speak would cost him his life. Whenhis daughter caught sight of him she covered her eyes so as not to seehim, and her father was horror-stricken, not knowing how willingly she hadplaced herself in our hands. But it was now most essential for us to be onthe move, and carefully and quickly we regained the vessel, where thosewho had remained on board were waiting for us in apprehension of somemishap having befallen us. It was barely two hours after night set in whenwe were all on board the vessel, where the cords were removed from thehands of Zoraida&rsquo;s father, and the napkin from his mouth; but the renegadeonce more told him not to utter a word, or they would take his life. He,when he saw his daughter there, began to sigh piteously, and still morewhen he perceived that I held her closely embraced and that she lay quietwithout resisting or complaining, or showing any reluctance; neverthelesshe remained silent lest they should carry into effect the repeated threatsthe renegade had addressed to him.</p><p>Finding herself now on board, and that we were about to give way with theoars, Zoraida, seeing her father there, and the other Moors bound, badethe renegade ask me to do her the favour of releasing the Moors andsetting her father at liberty, for she would rather drown herself in thesea than suffer a father that had loved her so dearly to be carried awaycaptive before her eyes and on her account. The renegade repeated this tome, and I replied that I was very willing to do so; but he replied that itwas not advisable, because if they were left there they would at onceraise the country and stir up the city, and lead to the despatch of swiftcruisers in pursuit, and our being taken, by sea or land, without anypossibility of escape; and that all that could be done was to set themfree on the first Christian ground we reached. On this point we allagreed; and Zoraida, to whom it was explained, together with the reasonsthat prevented us from doing at once what she desired, was satisfiedlikewise; and then in glad silence and with cheerful alacrity each of ourstout rowers took his oar, and commending ourselves to God with all ourhearts, we began to shape our course for the island of Majorca, thenearest Christian land. Owing, however, to the Tramontana rising a little,and the sea growing somewhat rough, it was impossible for us to keep astraight course for Majorca, and we were compelled to coast in thedirection of Oran, not without great uneasiness on our part lest we shouldbe observed from the town of Shershel, which lies on that coast, not morethan sixty miles from Algiers. Moreover we were afraid of meeting on thatcourse one of the galliots that usually come with goods from Tetuan;although each of us for himself and all of us together felt confidentthat, if we were to meet a merchant galliot, so that it were not acruiser, not only should we not be lost, but that we should take a vesselin which we could more safely accomplish our voyage. As we pursued ourcourse Zoraida kept her head between my hands so as not to see her father,and I felt that she was praying to Lela Marien to help us.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c41d" id="c41d"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c41d.jpg (266K)" src="images/c41d.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c41d.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>We might have made about thirty miles when daybreak found us some threemusket-shots off the land, which seemed to us deserted, and without anyoneto see us. For all that, however, by hard rowing we put out a little tosea, for it was now somewhat calmer, and having gained about two leaguesthe word was given to row by batches, while we ate something, for thevessel was well provided; but the rowers said it was not a time to takeany rest; let food be served out to those who were not rowing, but theywould not leave their oars on any account. This was done, but now a stiffbreeze began to blow, which obliged us to leave off rowing and make sailat once and steer for Oran, as it was impossible to make any other course.All this was done very promptly, and under sail we ran more than eightmiles an hour without any fear, except that of coming across some vesselout on a roving expedition. We gave the Moorish rowers some food, and therenegade comforted them by telling them that they were not held ascaptives, as we should set them free on the first opportunity.</p><p>The same was said to Zoraida&rsquo;s father, who replied, &ldquo;Anything else,Christian, I might hope for or think likely from your generosity and goodbehaviour, but do not think me so simple as to imagine you will give me myliberty; for you would have never exposed yourselves to the danger ofdepriving me of it only to restore it to me so generously, especially asyou know who I am and the sum you may expect to receive on restoring it;and if you will only name that, I here offer you all you require formyself and for my unhappy daughter there; or else for her alone, for sheis the greatest and most precious part of my soul.&rdquo;</p><p>As he said this he began to weep so bitterly that he filled us all withcompassion and forced Zoraida to look at him, and when she saw him weepingshe was so moved that she rose from my feet and ran to throw her armsround him, and pressing her face to his, they both gave way to such anoutburst of tears that several of us were constrained to keep themcompany.</p><p>But when her father saw her in full dress and with all her jewels abouther, he said to her in his own language, &ldquo;What means this, my daughter?Last night, before this terrible misfortune in which we are plunged befellus, I saw thee in thy everyday and indoor garments; and now, withouthaving had time to attire thyself, and without my bringing thee any joyfultidings to furnish an occasion for adorning and bedecking thyself, I seethee arrayed in the finest attire it would be in my power to give theewhen fortune was most kind to us. Answer me this; for it causes me greateranxiety and surprise than even this misfortune itself.&rdquo;</p><p>The renegade interpreted to us what the Moor said to his daughter; she,however, returned him no answer. But when he observed in one corner of thevessel the little trunk in which she used to keep her jewels, which hewell knew he had left in Algiers and had not brought to the garden, he wasstill more amazed, and asked her how that trunk had come into our hands,and what there was in it. To which the renegade, without waiting forZoraida to reply, made answer, &ldquo;Do not trouble thyself by asking thydaughter Zoraida so many questions, señor, for the one answer I will givethee will serve for all; I would have thee know that she is a Christian,and that it is she who has been the file for our chains and our delivererfrom captivity. She is here of her own free will, as glad, I imagine, tofind herself in this position as he who escapes from darkness into thelight, from death to life, and from suffering to glory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Daughter, is this true, what he says?&rdquo; cried the Moor.</p><p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Zoraida.</p><p>&ldquo;That thou art in truth a Christian,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;and that thouhast given thy father into the power of his enemies?&rdquo;</p><p>To which Zoraida made answer, &ldquo;A Christian I am, but it is not I who haveplaced thee in this position, for it never was my wish to leave thee or dothee harm, but only to do good to myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what good hast thou done thyself, daughter?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;Ask thou that,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;of Lela Marien, for she can tell thee betterthan I.&rdquo;</p><p>The Moor had hardly heard these words when with marvellous quickness heflung himself headforemost into the sea, where no doubt he would have beendrowned had not the long and full dress he wore held him up for a littleon the surface of the water. Zoraida cried aloud to us to save him, and weall hastened to help, and seizing him by his robe we drew him in halfdrowned and insensible, at which Zoraida was in such distress that shewept over him as piteously and bitterly as though he were already dead. Weturned him upon his face and he voided a great quantity of water, and atthe end of two hours came to himself. Meanwhile, the wind having changedwe were compelled to head for the land, and ply our oars to avoid beingdriven on shore; but it was our good fortune to reach a creek that lies onone side of a small promontory or cape, called by the Moors that of the&ldquo;Cava rumia,&rdquo; which in our language means &ldquo;the wicked Christian woman;&rdquo;for it is a tradition among them that La Cava, through whom Spain waslost, lies buried at that spot; &ldquo;cava&rdquo; in their language meaning &ldquo;wickedwoman,&rdquo; and &ldquo;rumia&rdquo; &ldquo;Christian;&rdquo; moreover, they count it unlucky to anchorthere when necessity compels them, and they never do so otherwise. For us,however, it was not the resting-place of the wicked woman but a haven ofsafety for our relief, so much had the sea now got up. We posted alook-out on shore, and never let the oars out of our hands, and ate of thestores the renegade had laid in, imploring God and Our Lady with all ourhearts to help and protect us, that we might give a happy ending to abeginning so prosperous. At the entreaty of Zoraida orders were given toset on shore her father and the other Moors who were still bound, for shecould not endure, nor could her tender heart bear to see her father inbonds and her fellow-countrymen prisoners before her eyes. We promised herto do this at the moment of departure, for as it was uninhabited we ran norisk in releasing them at that place.</p><p>Our prayers were not so far in vain as to be unheard by Heaven, for aftera while the wind changed in our favour, and made the sea calm, inviting usonce more to resume our voyage with a good heart. Seeing this we unboundthe Moors, and one by one put them on shore, at which they were filledwith amazement; but when we came to land Zoraida&rsquo;s father, who had nowcompletely recovered his senses, he said:</p><p>&ldquo;Why is it, think ye, Christians, that this wicked woman is rejoiced atyour giving me my liberty? Think ye it is because of the affection shebears me? Nay verily, it is only because of the hindrance my presenceoffers to the execution of her base designs. And think not that it is herbelief that yours is better than ours that has led her to change herreligion; it is only because she knows that immodesty is more freelypractised in your country than in ours.&rdquo; Then turning to Zoraida, while Iand another of the Christians held him fast by both arms, lest he shoulddo some mad act, he said to her, &ldquo;Infamous girl, misguided maiden, whitherin thy blindness and madness art thou going in the hands of these dogs,our natural enemies? Cursed be the hour when I begot thee! Cursed theluxury and indulgence in which I reared thee!&rdquo;</p><p>But seeing that he was not likely soon to cease I made haste to put him onshore, and thence he continued his maledictions and lamentations aloud;calling on Mohammed to pray to Allah to destroy us, to confound us, tomake an end of us; and when, in consequence of having made sail, we couldno longer hear what he said we could see what he did; how he plucked outhis beard and tore his hair and lay writhing on the ground. But once heraised his voice to such a pitch that we were able to hear what he said.&ldquo;Come back, dear daughter, come back to shore; I forgive thee all; letthose men have the money, for it is theirs now, and come back to comfortthy sorrowing father, who will yield up his life on this barren strand ifthou dost leave him.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c41e" id="c41e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c41e.jpg (281K)" src="images/c41e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c41e.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>All this Zoraida heard, and heard with sorrow and tears, and all she couldsay in answer was, &ldquo;Allah grant that Lela Marien, who has made me become aChristian, give thee comfort in thy sorrow, my father. Allah knows that Icould not do otherwise than I have done, and that these Christians owenothing to my will; for even had I wished not to accompany them, butremain at home, it would have been impossible for me, so eagerly did mysoul urge me on to the accomplishment of this purpose, which I feel to beas righteous as to thee, dear father, it seems wicked.&rdquo;</p><p>But neither could her father hear her nor we see him when she said this;and so, while I consoled Zoraida, we turned our attention to our voyage,in which a breeze from the right point so favoured us that we made sure offinding ourselves off the coast of Spain on the morrow by daybreak. But,as good seldom or never comes pure and unmixed, without being attended orfollowed by some disturbing evil that gives a shock to it, our fortune, orperhaps the curses which the Moor had hurled at his daughter (for whateverkind of father they may come from these are always to be dreaded), broughtit about that when we were now in mid-sea, and the night about three hoursspent, as we were running with all sail set and oars lashed, for thefavouring breeze saved us the trouble of using them, we saw by the lightof the moon, which shone brilliantly, a square-rigged vessel in full sailclose to us, luffing up and standing across our course, and so close thatwe had to strike sail to avoid running foul of her, while they too put thehelm hard up to let us pass. They came to the side of the ship to ask whowe were, whither we were bound, and whence we came, but as they asked thisin French our renegade said, &ldquo;Let no one answer, for no doubt these areFrench corsairs who plunder all comers.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c41f" id="c41f"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c41f.jpg (268K)" src="images/c41f.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c41f.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Acting on this warning no one answered a word, but after we had gone alittle ahead, and the vessel was now lying to leeward, suddenly they firedtwo guns, and apparently both loaded with chain-shot, for with one theycut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail into the sea,and the other, discharged at the same moment, sent a ball into our vesselamidships, staving her in completely, but without doing any furtherdamage. We, however, finding ourselves sinking began to shout for help andcall upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were beginning to fill.They then lay to, and lowering a skiff or boat, as many as a dozenFrenchmen, well armed with match-locks, and their matches burning, gotinto it and came alongside; and seeing how few we were, and that ourvessel was going down, they took us in, telling us that this had come tous through our incivility in not giving them an answer. Our renegade tookthe trunk containing Zoraida&rsquo;s wealth and dropped it into the sea withoutanyone perceiving what he did. In short we went on board with theFrenchmen, who, after having ascertained all they wanted to know about us,rifled us of everything we had, as if they had been our bitterest enemies,and from Zoraida they took even the anklets she wore on her feet; but thedistress they caused her did not distress me so much as the fear I was inthat from robbing her of her rich and precious jewels they would proceedto rob her of the most precious jewel that she valued more than all. Thedesires, however, of those people do not go beyond money, but of thattheir covetousness is insatiable, and on this occasion it was carried tosuch a pitch that they would have taken even the clothes we wore ascaptives if they had been worth anything to them. It was the advice ofsome of them to throw us all into the sea wrapped up in a sail; for theirpurpose was to trade at some of the ports of Spain, giving themselves outas Bretons, and if they brought us alive they would be punished as soon asthe robbery was discovered; but the captain (who was the one who hadplundered my beloved Zoraida) said he was satisfied with the prize he hadgot, and that he would not touch at any Spanish port, but pass the Straitsof Gibraltar by night, or as best he could, and make for La Rochelle, fromwhich he had sailed. So they agreed by common consent to give us the skiffbelonging to their ship and all we required for the short voyage thatremained to us, and this they did the next day on coming in sight of theSpanish coast, with which, and the joy we felt, all our sufferings andmiseries were as completely forgotten as if they had never been endured byus, such is the delight of recovering lost liberty.</p><p>It may have been about mid-day when they placed us in the boat, giving ustwo kegs of water and some biscuit; and the captain, moved by I know notwhat compassion, as the lovely Zoraida was about to embark, gave her someforty gold crowns, and would not permit his men to take from her thosesame garments which she has on now. We got into the boat, returning themthanks for their kindness to us, and showing ourselves grateful ratherthan indignant. They stood out to sea, steering for the straits; we,without looking to any compass save the land we had before us, setourselves to row with such energy that by sunset we were so near that wemight easily, we thought, land before the night was far advanced. But asthe moon did not show that night, and the sky was clouded, and as we knewnot whereabouts we were, it did not seem to us a prudent thing to make forthe shore, as several of us advised, saying we ought to run ourselvesashore even if it were on rocks and far from any habitation, for in thisway we should be relieved from the apprehensions we naturally felt of theprowling vessels of the Tetuan corsairs, who leave Barbary at nightfalland are on the Spanish coast by daybreak, where they commonly take someprize, and then go home to sleep in their own houses. But of theconflicting counsels the one which was adopted was that we should approachgradually, and land where we could if the sea were calm enough to permitus. This was done, and a little before midnight we drew near to the footof a huge and lofty mountain, not so close to the sea but that it left anarrow space on which to land conveniently. We ran our boat up on thesand, and all sprang out and kissed the ground, and with tears of joyfulsatisfaction returned thanks to God our Lord for all his incomparablegoodness to us on our voyage. We took out of the boat the provisions itcontained, and drew it up on the shore, and then climbed a long way up themountain, for even there we could not feel easy in our hearts, or persuadeourselves that it was Christian soil that was now under our feet.</p><p>The dawn came, more slowly, I think, than we could have wished; wecompleted the ascent in order to see if from the summit any habitation orany shepherds&rsquo; huts could be discovered, but strain our eyes as we might,neither dwelling, nor human being, nor path nor road could we perceive.However, we determined to push on farther, as it could not but be that erelong we must see someone who could tell us where we were. But whatdistressed me most was to see Zoraida going on foot over that roughground; for though I once carried her on my shoulders, she was morewearied by my weariness than rested by the rest; and so she would neveragain allow me to undergo the exertion, and went on very patiently andcheerfully, while I led her by the hand. We had gone rather less than aquarter of a league when the sound of a little bell fell on our ears, aclear proof that there were flocks hard by, and looking about carefully tosee if any were within view, we observed a young shepherd tranquilly andunsuspiciously trimming a stick with his knife at the foot of a cork tree.We called to him, and he, raising his head, sprang nimbly to his feet,for, as we afterwards learned, the first who presented themselves to hissight were the renegade and Zoraida, and seeing them in Moorish dress heimagined that all the Moors of Barbary were upon him; and plunging withmarvellous swiftness into the thicket in front of him, he began to raise aprodigious outcry, exclaiming, &ldquo;The Moors&mdash;the Moors have landed! Toarms, to arms!&rdquo; We were all thrown into perplexity by these cries, notknowing what to do; but reflecting that the shouts of the shepherd wouldraise the country and that the mounted coast-guard would come at once tosee what was the matter, we agreed that the renegade must strip off hisTurkish garments and put on a captive&rsquo;s jacket or coat which one of ourparty gave him at once, though he himself was reduced to his shirt; and socommending ourselves to God, we followed the same road which we saw theshepherd take, expecting every moment that the coast-guard would be downupon us. Nor did our expectation deceive us, for two hours had not passedwhen, coming out of the brushwood into the open ground, we perceived somefifty mounted men swiftly approaching us at a hand-gallop. As soon as wesaw them we stood still, waiting for them; but as they came close and,instead of the Moors they were in quest of, saw a set of poor Christians,they were taken aback, and one of them asked if it could be we who werethe cause of the shepherd having raised the call to arms. I said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;and as I was about to explain to him what had occurred, and whence we cameand who we were, one of the Christians of our party recognised thehorseman who had put the question to us, and before I could say anythingmore he exclaimed:</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks be to God, sirs, for bringing us to such good quarters; for, if Ido not deceive myself, the ground we stand on is that of Velez Malagaunless, indeed, all my years of captivity have made me unable to recollectthat you, señor, who ask who we are, are Pedro de Bustamante, my uncle.&rdquo;</p><p>The Christian captive had hardly uttered these words, when the horsemanthrew himself off his horse, and ran to embrace the young man, crying:</p><p>&ldquo;Nephew of my soul and life! I recognise thee now; and long have I mournedthee as dead, I, and my sister, thy mother, and all thy kin that are stillalive, and whom God has been pleased to preserve that they may enjoy thehappiness of seeing thee. We knew long since that thou wert in Algiers,and from the appearance of thy garments and those of all this company, Iconclude that ye have had a miraculous restoration to liberty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;and by-and-by we will tell you all.&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as the horsemen understood that we were Christian captives, theydismounted from their horses, and each offered his to carry us to the cityof Velez Malaga, which was a league and a half distant. Some of them wentto bring the boat to the city, we having told them where we had left it;others took us up behind them, and Zoraida was placed on the horse of theyoung man&rsquo;s uncle. The whole town came out to meet us, for they had bythis time heard of our arrival from one who had gone on in advance. Theywere not astonished to see liberated captives or captive Moors, for peopleon that coast are well used to see both one and the other; but they wereastonished at the beauty of Zoraida, which was just then heightened, aswell by the exertion of travelling as by joy at finding herself onChristian soil, and relieved of all fear of being lost; for this hadbrought such a glow upon her face, that unless my affection for her weredeceiving me, I would venture to say that there was not a more beautifulcreature in the world&mdash;at least, that I had ever seen. We wentstraight to the church to return thanks to God for the mercies we hadreceived, and when Zoraida entered it she said there were faces there likeLela Marien&rsquo;s. We told her they were her images; and as well as he couldthe renegade explained to her what they meant, that she might adore themas if each of them were the very same Lela Marien that had spoken to her;and she, having great intelligence and a quick and clear instinct,understood at once all he said to her about them. Thence they took us awayand distributed us all in different houses in the town; but as for therenegade, Zoraida, and myself, the Christian who came with us brought usto the house of his parents, who had a fair share of the gifts of fortune,and treated us with as much kindness as they did their own son.</p><p>We remained six days in Velez, at the end of which the renegade, havinginformed himself of all that was requisite for him to do, set out for thecity of Granada to restore himself to the sacred bosom of the Churchthrough the medium of the Holy Inquisition. The other released captivestook their departures, each the way that seemed best to him, and Zoraidaand I were left alone, with nothing more than the crowns which thecourtesy of the Frenchman had bestowed upon Zoraida, out of which I boughtthe beast on which she rides; and, I for the present attending her as herfather and squire and not as her husband, we are now going to ascertain ifmy father is living, or if any of my brothers has had better fortune thanmine has been; though, as Heaven has made me the companion of Zoraida, Ithink no other lot could be assigned to me, however happy, that I wouldrather have. The patience with which she endures the hardships thatpoverty brings with it, and the eagerness she shows to become a Christian,are such that they fill me with admiration, and bind me to serve her allmy life; though the happiness I feel in seeing myself hers, and her mine,is disturbed and marred by not knowing whether I shall find any corner toshelter her in my own country, or whether time and death may not have madesuch changes in the fortunes and lives of my father and brothers, that Ishall hardly find anyone who knows me, if they are not alive.</p><p>I have no more of my story to tell you, gentlemen; whether it be aninteresting or a curious one let your better judgments decide; all I cansay is I would gladly have told it to you more briefly; although my fearof wearying you has made me leave out more than one circumstance.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c41g" id="c41g"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c41g.jpg (33K)" src="images/c41g.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch42" id="ch42"></a>CHAPTER XLII.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF WHAT FURTHER TOOK PLACE IN THE INN, AND OF SEVERAL OTHERTHINGS WORTH KNOWING</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c42a" id="c42a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c42a.jpg (139K)" src="images/c42a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c42a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>With these words the captive held his peace, and Don Fernando said to him,&ldquo;In truth, captain, the manner in which you have related this remarkableadventure has been such as befitted the novelty and strangeness of thematter. The whole story is curious and uncommon, and abounds withincidents that fill the hearers with wonder and astonishment; and so greatis the pleasure we have found in listening to it that we should be glad ifit were to begin again, even though to-morrow were to find us stilloccupied with the same tale.&rdquo; And while he said this Cardenio and the restof them offered to be of service to him in any way that lay in theirpower, and in words and language so kindly and sincere that the captainwas much gratified by their good-will. In particular Don Fernando offered,if he would go back with him, to get his brother the marquis to becomegodfather at the baptism of Zoraida, and on his own part to provide himwith the means of making his appearance in his own country with the creditand comfort he was entitled to. For all this the captive returned thanksvery courteously, although he would not accept any of their generousoffers.</p><p>By this time night closed in, and as it did, there came up to the inn acoach attended by some men on horseback, who demanded accommodation; towhich the landlady replied that there was not a hand&rsquo;s breadth of thewhole inn unoccupied.</p><p>&ldquo;Still, for all that,&rdquo; said one of those who had entered on horseback,&ldquo;room must be found for his lordship the Judge here.&rdquo;</p><p>At this name the landlady was taken aback, and said, &ldquo;Señor, the fact is Ihave no beds; but if his lordship the Judge carries one with him, as nodoubt he does, let him come in and welcome; for my husband and I will giveup our room to accommodate his worship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very good, so be it,&rdquo; said the squire; but in the meantime a man had gotout of the coach whose dress indicated at a glance the office and post heheld, for the long robe with ruffled sleeves that he wore showed that hewas, as his servant said, a Judge of appeal. He led by the hand a younggirl in a travelling dress, apparently about sixteen years of age, and ofsuch a high-bred air, so beautiful and so graceful, that all were filledwith admiration when she made her appearance, and but for having seenDorothea, Luscinda, and Zoraida, who were there in the inn, they wouldhave fancied that a beauty like that of this maiden&rsquo;s would have been hardto find. Don Quixote was present at the entrance of the Judge with theyoung lady, and as soon as he saw him he said, &ldquo;Your worship may withconfidence enter and take your ease in this castle; for though theaccommodation be scanty and poor, there are no quarters so cramped orinconvenient that they cannot make room for arms and letters; above all ifarms and letters have beauty for a guide and leader, as lettersrepresented by your worship have in this fair maiden, to whom not onlyought castles to throw themselves open and yield themselves up, but rocksshould rend themselves asunder and mountains divide and bow themselvesdown to give her a reception. Enter, your worship, I say, into thisparadise, for here you will find stars and suns to accompany the heavenyour worship brings with you, here you will find arms in their supremeexcellence, and beauty in its highest perfection.&rdquo;</p><p>The Judge was struck with amazement at the language of Don Quixote, whomhe scrutinized very carefully, no less astonished by his figure than byhis talk; and before he could find words to answer him he had a freshsurprise, when he saw opposite to him Luscinda, Dorothea, and Zoraida,who, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the young lady,had come to see her and welcome her; Don Fernando, Cardenio, and thecurate, however, greeted him in a more intelligible and polished style. Inshort, the Judge made his entrance in a state of bewilderment, as wellwith what he saw as what he heard, and the fair ladies of the inn gave thefair damsel a cordial welcome. On the whole he could perceive that all whowere there were people of quality; but with the figure, countenance, andbearing of Don Quixote he was at his wits&rsquo; end; and all civilities havingbeen exchanged, and the accommodation of the inn inquired into, it wassettled, as it had been before settled, that all the women should retireto the garret that has been already mentioned, and that the men shouldremain outside as if to guard them; the Judge, therefore, was very wellpleased to allow his daughter, for such the damsel was, to go with theladies, which she did very willingly; and with part of the host&rsquo;s narrowbed and half of what the Judge had brought with him, they made a morecomfortable arrangement for the night than they had expected.</p><p>The captive, whose heart had leaped within him the instant he saw theJudge, telling him somehow that this was his brother, asked one of theservants who accompanied him what his name was, and whether he knew fromwhat part of the country he came. The servant replied that he was calledthe Licentiate Juan Perez de Viedma, and that he had heard it said he camefrom a village in the mountains of Leon. From this statement, and what hehimself had seen, he felt convinced that this was his brother who hadadopted letters by his father&rsquo;s advice; and excited and rejoiced, hecalled Don Fernando and Cardenio and the curate aside, and told them howthe matter stood, assuring them that the judge was his brother. Theservant had further informed him that he was now going to the Indies withthe appointment of Judge of the Supreme Court of Mexico; and he hadlearned, likewise, that the young lady was his daughter, whose mother haddied in giving birth to her, and that he was very rich in consequence ofthe dowry left to him with the daughter. He asked their advice as to whatmeans he should adopt to make himself known, or to ascertain beforehandwhether, when he had made himself known, his brother, seeing him so poor,would be ashamed of him, or would receive him with a warm heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave it to me to find out that,&rdquo; said the curate; &ldquo;though there is noreason for supposing, señor captain, that you will not be kindly received,because the worth and wisdom that your brother&rsquo;s bearing shows him topossess do not make it likely that he will prove haughty or insensible, orthat he will not know how to estimate the accidents of fortune at theirproper value.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;I would not make myself known abruptly, but insome indirect way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have told you already,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;that I will manage it in away to satisfy us all.&rdquo;</p><p>By this time supper was ready, and they all took their seats at the table,except the captive, and the ladies, who supped by themselves in their ownroom. In the middle of supper the curate said:</p><p>&ldquo;I had a comrade of your worship&rsquo;s name, Señor Judge, in Constantinople,where I was a captive for several years, and that same comrade was one ofthe stoutest soldiers and captains in the whole Spanish infantry; but hehad as large a share of misfortune as he had of gallantry and courage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how was the captain called, señor?&rdquo; asked the Judge.</p><p>&ldquo;He was called Ruy Perez de Viedma,&rdquo; replied the curate, &ldquo;and he was bornin a village in the mountains of Leon; and he mentioned a circumstanceconnected with his father and his brothers which, had it not been told meby so truthful a man as he was, I should have set down as one of thosefables the old women tell over the fire in winter; for he said his fatherhad divided his property among his three sons and had addressed words ofadvice to them sounder than any of Cato&rsquo;s. But I can say this much, thatthe choice he made of going to the wars was attended with such success,that by his gallant conduct and courage, and without any help save his ownmerit, he rose in a few years to be captain of infantry, and to seehimself on the high-road and in position to be given the command of acorps before long; but Fortune was against him, for where he might haveexpected her favour he lost it, and with it his liberty, on that gloriousday when so many recovered theirs, at the battle of Lepanto. I lost mineat the Goletta, and after a variety of adventures we found ourselvescomrades at Constantinople. Thence he went to Algiers, where he met withone of the most extraordinary adventures that ever befell anyone in theworld.&rdquo;</p><p>Here the curate went on to relate briefly his brother&rsquo;s adventure withZoraida; to all which the Judge gave such an attentive hearing that henever before had been so much of a hearer. The curate, however, only wentso far as to describe how the Frenchmen plundered those who were in theboat, and the poverty and distress in which his comrade and the fair Moorwere left, of whom he said he had not been able to learn what became ofthem, or whether they had reached Spain, or been carried to France by theFrenchmen.</p><p>The captain, standing a little to one side, was listening to all thecurate said, and watching every movement of his brother, who, as soon ashe perceived the curate had made an end of his story, gave a deep sigh andsaid with his eyes full of tears, &ldquo;Oh, señor, if you only knew what newsyou have given me and how it comes home to me, making me show how I feelit with these tears that spring from my eyes in spite of all my worldlywisdom and self-restraint! That brave captain that you speak of is myeldest brother, who, being of a bolder and loftier mind than my otherbrother or myself, chose the honourable and worthy calling of arms, whichwas one of the three careers our father proposed to us, as your comradementioned in that fable you thought he was telling you. I followed that ofletters, in which God and my own exertions have raised me to the positionin which you see me. My second brother is in Peru, so wealthy that withwhat he has sent to my father and to me he has fully repaid the portion hetook with him, and has even furnished my father&rsquo;s hands with the means ofgratifying his natural generosity, while I too have been enabled to pursuemy studies in a more becoming and creditable fashion, and so to attain mypresent standing. My father is still alive, though dying with anxiety tohear of his eldest son, and he prays God unceasingly that death may notclose his eyes until he has looked upon those of his son; but with regardto him what surprises me is, that having so much common sense as he had,he should have neglected to give any intelligence about himself, either inhis troubles and sufferings, or in his prosperity, for if his father orany of us had known of his condition he need not have waited for thatmiracle of the reed to obtain his ransom; but what now disquiets me is theuncertainty whether those Frenchmen may have restored him to liberty, ormurdered him to hide the robbery. All this will make me continue myjourney, not with the satisfaction in which I began it, but in the deepestmelancholy and sadness. Oh dear brother! that I only knew where thou artnow, and I would hasten to seek thee out and deliver thee from thysufferings, though it were to cost me suffering myself! Oh that I couldbring news to our old father that thou art alive, even wert thou in thedeepest dungeon of Barbary; for his wealth and my brother&rsquo;s and mine wouldrescue thee thence! Oh beautiful and generous Zoraida, that I could repaythy goodness to a brother! That I could be present at the new birthof thy soul, and at thy bridal that would give us all such happiness!&rdquo;</p><p>All this and more the Judge uttered with such deep emotion at the news hehad received of his brother that all who heard him shared in it, showingtheir sympathy with his sorrow. The curate, seeing, then, how well he hadsucceeded in carrying out his purpose and the captain&rsquo;s wishes, had nodesire to keep them unhappy any longer, so he rose from the table andgoing into the room where Zoraida was he took her by the hand, Luscinda,Dorothea, and the Judge&rsquo;s daughter following her. The captain was waitingto see what the curate would do, when the latter, taking him with theother hand, advanced with both of them to where the Judge and the othergentlemen were and said, &ldquo;Let your tears cease to flow, Señor Judge, andthe wish of your heart be gratified as fully as you could desire, for youhave before you your worthy brother and your good sister-in-law. He whomyou see here is the Captain Viedma, and this is the fair Moor who has beenso good to him. The Frenchmen I told you of have reduced them to the stateof poverty you see that you may show the generosity of your kind heart.&rdquo;</p><p>The captain ran to embrace his brother, who placed both hands on hisbreast so as to have a good look at him, holding him a little way off butas soon as he had fully recognised him he clasped him in his arms soclosely, shedding such tears of heartfelt joy, that most of those presentcould not but join in them. The words the brothers exchanged, the emotionthey showed can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much less put down inwriting. They told each other in a few words the events of their lives;they showed the true affection of brothers in all its strength; then thejudge embraced Zoraida, putting all he possessed at her disposal; then hemade his daughter embrace her, and the fair Christian and the lovely Moordrew fresh tears from every eye. And there was Don Quixote observing allthese strange proceedings attentively without uttering a word, andattributing the whole to chimeras of knight-errantry. Then they agreedthat the captain and Zoraida should return with his brother to Seville,and send news to his father of his having been delivered and found, so asto enable him to come and be present at the marriage and baptism ofZoraida, for it was impossible for the Judge to put off his journey, as hewas informed that in a month from that time the fleet was to sail fromSeville for New Spain, and to miss the passage would have been a greatinconvenience to him. In short, everybody was well pleased and glad at thecaptive&rsquo;s good fortune; and as now almost two-thirds of the night werepast, they resolved to retire to rest for the remainder of it. Don Quixoteoffered to mount guard over the castle lest they should be attacked bysome giant or other malevolent scoundrel, covetous of the great treasureof beauty the castle contained. Those who understood him returned himthanks for this service, and they gave the Judge an account of hisextraordinary humour, with which he was not a little amused. Sancho Panzaalone was fuming at the lateness of the hour for retiring to rest; and heof all was the one that made himself most comfortable, as he stretchedhimself on the trappings of his ass, which, as will be told farther on,cost him so dear.</p><p>The ladies, then, having retired to their chamber, and the others havingdisposed themselves with as little discomfort as they could, Don Quixotesallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he hadpromised. It happened, however, that a little before the approach of dawna voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies that it forcedthem all to listen attentively, but especially Dorothea, who had beenawake, and by whose side Doña Clara de Viedma, for so the Judge&rsquo;s daughterwas called, lay sleeping. No one could imagine who it was that sang sosweetly, and the voice was unaccompanied by any instrument. At one momentit seemed to them as if the singer were in the courtyard, at another inthe stable; and as they were all attention, wondering, Cardenio came tothe door and said, &ldquo;Listen, whoever is not asleep, and you will hear amuleteer&rsquo;s voice that enchants as it chants.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We are listening to it already, señor,&rdquo; said Dorothea; on which Cardeniowent away; and Dorothea, giving all her attention to it, made out thewords of the song to be these:</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c42e" id="c42e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c42e.jpg (11K)" src="images/c42e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch43" id="ch43"></a>CHAPTER XLIII.<br/>WHEREIN IS RELATED THE PLEASANT STORY OF THE MULETEER, TOGETHER WITH OTHERSTRANGE THINGS THAT CAME TO PASS IN THE INN</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c43a" id="c43a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c43a.jpg (127K)" src="images/c43a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c43a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p class="poem">Ah me, Love&rsquo;s mariner am I<br/>On Love&rsquo;s deep ocean sailing;<br/>I know not where the haven lies,<br/>I dare not hope to gain it.<br/><br/>One solitary distant star<br/>Is all I have to guide me,<br/>A brighter orb than those of old<br/>That Palinurus lighted.<br/><br/>And vaguely drifting am I borne,<br/>I know not where it leads me;<br/>I fix my gaze on it alone,<br/>Of all beside it heedless.<br/><br/>But over-cautious prudery,<br/>And coyness cold and cruel,<br/>When most I need it, these, like clouds,<br/>Its longed-for light refuse me.<br/><br/>Bright star, goal of my yearning eyes<br/>As thou above me beamest,<br/>When thou shalt hide thee from my sight<br/>I&rsquo;ll know that death is near me.<br/></p><p>The singer had got so far when it struck Dorothea that it was not fair tolet Clara miss hearing such a sweet voice, so, shaking her from side toside, she woke her, saying:</p><p>&ldquo;Forgive me, child, for waking thee, but I do so that thou mayest have thepleasure of hearing the best voice thou hast ever heard, perhaps, in allthy life.&rdquo;</p><p>Clara awoke quite drowsy, and not understanding at the moment whatDorothea said, asked her what it was; she repeated what she had said, andClara became attentive at once; but she had hardly heard two lines, as thesinger continued, when a strange trembling seized her, as if she weresuffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, and throwing her armsround Dorothea she said:</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, dear lady of my soul and life! why did you wake me? The greatestkindness fortune could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears so asneither to see or hear that unhappy musician.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What art thou talking about, child?&rdquo; said Dorothea. &ldquo;Why, they say thissinger is a muleteer!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nay, he is the lord of many places,&rdquo; replied Clara, &ldquo;and that one in myheart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him, unless he bewilling to surrender it.&rdquo;</p><p>Dorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl, for it seemed tobe far beyond such experience of life as her tender years gave any promiseof, so she said to her:</p><p>&ldquo;You speak in such a way that I cannot understand you, Señora Clara;explain yourself more clearly, and tell me what is this you are sayingabout hearts and places and this musician whose voice has so moved you?But do not tell me anything now; I do not want to lose the pleasure I getfrom listening to the singer by giving my attention to your transports,for I perceive he is beginning to sing a new strain and a new air.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let him, in Heaven&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; returned Clara; and not to hear him shestopped both ears with her hands, at which Dorothea was again surprised;but turning her attention to the song she found that it ran in thisfashion:</p><p class="poem">Sweet Hope, my stay,<br/>That onward to the goal of thy intent<br/>Dost make thy way,<br/>Heedless of hindrance or impediment,<br/>Have thou no fear<br/>If at each step thou findest death is near.<br/><br/>No victory,<br/>No joy of triumph doth the faint heart know;<br/>Unblest is he<br/>That a bold front to Fortune dares not show,<br/>But soul and sense<br/>In bondage yieldeth up to indolence.<br/><br/>If Love his wares<br/>Do dearly sell, his right must be contest;<br/>What gold compares<br/>With that whereon his stamp he hath imprest?<br/>And all men know<br/>What costeth little that we rate but low.<br/><br/>Love resolute<br/>Knows not the word &ldquo;impossibility;&rdquo;<br/>And though my suit<br/>Beset by endless obstacles I see,<br/>Yet no despair<br/>Shall hold me bound to earth while heaven is there.<br/></p><p>Here the voice ceased and Clara&rsquo;s sobs began afresh, all which excitedDorothea&rsquo;s curiosity to know what could be the cause of singing so sweetand weeping so bitter, so she again asked her what it was she was going tosay before. On this Clara, afraid that Luscinda might overhear her,winding her arms tightly round Dorothea put her mouth so close to her earthat she could speak without fear of being heard by anyone else, and said:</p><p>&ldquo;This singer, dear señora, is the son of a gentleman of Aragon, lord oftwo villages, who lives opposite my father&rsquo;s house at Madrid; and thoughmy father had curtains to the windows of his house in winter, andlattice-work in summer, in some way&mdash;I know not how&mdash;thisgentleman, who was pursuing his studies, saw me, whether in church orelsewhere, I cannot tell, and, in fact, fell in love with me, and gave meto know it from the windows of his house, with so many signs and tearsthat I was forced to believe him, and even to love him, without knowingwhat it was he wanted of me. One of the signs he used to make me was tolink one hand in the other, to show me he wished to marry me; and though Ishould have been glad if that could be, being alone and motherless I knewnot whom to open my mind to, and so I left it as it was, showing him nofavour, except when my father, and his too, were from home, to raise thecurtain or the lattice a little and let him see me plainly, at which hewould show such delight that he seemed as if he were going mad. Meanwhilethe time for my father&rsquo;s departure arrived, which he became aware of, butnot from me, for I had never been able to tell him of it. He fell sick, ofgrief I believe, and so the day we were going away I could not see him totake farewell of him, were it only with the eyes. But after we had beentwo days on the road, on entering the posada of a village a day&rsquo;s journeyfrom this, I saw him at the inn door in the dress of a muleteer, and sowell disguised, that if I did not carry his image graven on my heart itwould have been impossible for me to recognise him. But I knew him, and Iwas surprised, and glad; he watched me, unsuspected by my father, fromwhom he always hides himself when he crosses my path on the road, or inthe posadas where we halt; and, as I know what he is, and reflect that forlove of me he makes this journey on foot in all this hardship, I am readyto die of sorrow; and where he sets foot there I set my eyes. I know notwith what object he has come; or how he could have got away from hisfather, who loves him beyond measure, having no other heir, and because hedeserves it, as you will perceive when you see him. And moreover, I cantell you, all that he sings is out of his own head; for I have heard themsay he is a great scholar and poet; and what is more, every time I see himor hear him sing I tremble all over, and am terrified lest my fathershould recognise him and come to know of our loves. I have never spoken aword to him in my life; and for all that I love him so that I could notlive without him. This, dear señora, is all I have to tell you about themusician whose voice has delighted you so much; and from it alone youmight easily perceive he is no muleteer, but a lord of hearts and towns,as I told you already.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say no more, Doña Clara,&rdquo; said Dorothea at this, at the same time kissingher a thousand times over, &ldquo;say no more, I tell you, but wait till daycomes; when I trust in God to arrange this affair of yours so that it mayhave the happy ending such an innocent beginning deserves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, señora,&rdquo; said Doña Clara, &ldquo;what end can be hoped for when his fatheris of such lofty position, and so wealthy, that he would think I was notfit to be even a servant to his son, much less wife? And as to marryingwithout the knowledge of my father, I would not do it for all the world. Iwould not ask anything more than that this youth should go back and leaveme; perhaps with not seeing him, and the long distance we shall have totravel, the pain I suffer now may become easier; though I daresay theremedy I propose will do me very little good. I don&rsquo;t know how the devilthis has come about, or how this love I have for him got in; I such ayoung girl, and he such a mere boy; for I verily believe we are both of anage, and I am not sixteen yet; for I will be sixteen Michaelmas Day, next,my father says.&rdquo;</p><p>Dorothea could not help laughing to hear how like a child Doña Claraspoke. &ldquo;Let us go to sleep now, señora,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for the little of thenight that I fancy is left to us: God will soon send us daylight, and wewill set all to rights, or it will go hard with me.&rdquo;</p><p>With this they fell asleep, and deep silence reigned all through the inn.The only persons not asleep were the landlady&rsquo;s daughter and her servantMaritornes, who, knowing the weak point of Don Quixote&rsquo;s humour, and thathe was outside the inn mounting guard in armour and on horseback,resolved, the pair of them, to play some trick upon him, or at any rate toamuse themselves for a while by listening to his nonsense. As it sohappened there was not a window in the whole inn that looked outwardsexcept a hole in the wall of a straw-loft through which they used to throwout the straw. At this hole the two demi-damsels posted themselves, andobserved Don Quixote on his horse, leaning on his pike and from time totime sending forth such deep and doleful sighs, that he seemed to pluck uphis soul by the roots with each of them; and they could hear him, too,saying in a soft, tender, loving tone, &ldquo;Oh my lady Dulcinea del Toboso,perfection of all beauty, summit and crown of discretion, treasure houseof grace, depositary of virtue, and finally, ideal of all that is good,honourable, and delectable in this world! What is thy grace doing now? Artthou, perchance, mindful of thy enslaved knight who of his own free willhath exposed himself to so great perils, and all to serve thee? Give metidings of her, oh luminary of the three faces! Perhaps at this moment,envious of hers, thou art regarding her, either as she paces to and frosome gallery of her sumptuous palaces, or leans over some balcony,meditating how, whilst preserving her purity and greatness, she maymitigate the tortures this wretched heart of mine endures for her sake,what glory should recompense my sufferings, what repose my toil, andlastly what death my life, and what reward my services? And thou, oh sun,that art now doubtless harnessing thy steeds in haste to rise betimes andcome forth to see my lady; when thou seest her I entreat of thee to saluteher on my behalf: but have a care, when thou shalt see her and salute her,that thou kiss not her face; for I shall be more jealous of thee than thouwert of that light-footed ingrate that made thee sweat and run so on theplains of Thessaly, or on the banks of the Peneus (for I do not exactlyrecollect where it was thou didst run on that occasion) in thy jealousyand love.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote had got so far in his pathetic speech when the landlady&rsquo;sdaughter began to signal to him, saying, &ldquo;Señor, come over here, please.&rdquo;</p><p>At these signals and voice Don Quixote turned his head and saw by thelight of the moon, which then was in its full splendour, that someone wascalling to him from the hole in the wall, which seemed to him to be awindow, and what is more, with a gilt grating, as rich castles, such as hebelieved the inn to be, ought to have; and it immediately suggested itselfto his imagination that, as on the former occasion, the fair damsel, thedaughter of the lady of the castle, overcome by love for him, was oncemore endeavouring to win his affections; and with this idea, not to showhimself discourteous, or ungrateful, he turned Rocinante&rsquo;s head andapproached the hole, and as he perceived the two wenches he said:</p><p>&ldquo;I pity you, beauteous lady, that you should have directed your thoughtsof love to a quarter from whence it is impossible that such a return canbe made to you as is due to your great merit and gentle birth, for whichyou must not blame this unhappy knight-errant whom love renders incapableof submission to any other than her whom, the first moment his eyes beheldher, he made absolute mistress of his soul. Forgive me, noble lady, andretire to your apartment, and do not, by any further declaration of yourpassion, compel me to show myself more ungrateful; and if, of the love youbear me, you should find that there is anything else in my power wherein Ican gratify you, provided it be not love itself, demand it of me; for Iswear to you by that sweet absent enemy of mine to grant it this instant,though it be that you require of me a lock of Medusa&rsquo;s hair, which was allsnakes, or even the very beams of the sun shut up in a vial.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir knight,&rdquo; said Maritornes atthis.</p><p>&ldquo;What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?&rdquo; replied DonQuixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Only one of your fair hands,&rdquo; said Maritornes, &ldquo;to enable her to ventover it the great passion, passion which has brought her to this loophole,so much to the risk of her honour; for if the lord her father had heardher, the least slice he would cut off her would be her ear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should like to see that tried,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but he had betterbeware of that, if he does not want to meet the most disastrous end thatever father in the world met for having laid hands on the tender limbs ofa love-stricken daughter.&rdquo;</p><p>Maritornes felt sure that Don Quixote would present the hand she hadasked, and making up her mind what to do, she got down from the hole andwent into the stable, where she took the halter of Sancho Panza&rsquo;s ass, andin all haste returned to the hole, just as Don Quixote had planted himselfstanding on Rocinante&rsquo;s saddle in order to reach the grated window wherehe supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and giving her his hand, he said,&ldquo;Lady, take this hand, or rather this scourge of the evil-doers of theearth; take, I say, this hand which no other hand of woman has evertouched, not even hers who has complete possession of my entire body. Ipresent it to you, not that you may kiss it, but that you may observe thecontexture of the sinews, the close network of the muscles, the breadthand capacity of the veins, whence you may infer what must be the strengthof the arm that has such a hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That we shall see presently,&rdquo; said Maritornes, and making a running knoton the halter, she passed it over his wrist and coming down from the holetied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the straw-loft.</p><p>Don Quixote, feeling the roughness of the rope on his wrist, exclaimed,&ldquo;Your grace seems to be grating rather than caressing my hand; treat itnot so harshly, for it is not to blame for the offence my resolution hasgiven you, nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a part;remember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself socruelly.&rdquo;</p><p>But there was nobody now to listen to these words of Don Quixote&rsquo;s, for assoon as Maritornes had tied him she and the other made off, ready to diewith laughing, leaving him fastened in such a way that it was impossiblefor him to release himself.</p><p>He was, as has been said, standing on Rocinante, with his arm passedthrough the hole and his wrist tied to the bolt of the door, and in mightyfear and dread of being left hanging by the arm if Rocinante were to stirone side or the other; so he did not dare to make the least movement,although from the patience and imperturbable disposition of Rocinante, hehad good reason to expect that he would stand without budging for a wholecentury. Finding himself fast, then, and that the ladies had retired, hebegan to fancy that all this was done by enchantment, as on the formeroccasion when in that same castle that enchanted Moor of a carrier hadbelaboured him; and he cursed in his heart his own want of sense andjudgment in venturing to enter the castle again, after having come off sobadly the first time; it being a settled point with knights-errant thatwhen they have tried an adventure, and have not succeeded in it, it is asign that it is not reserved for them but for others, and that thereforethey need not try it again. Nevertheless he pulled his arm to see if hecould release himself, but it had been made so fast that all his effortswere in vain. It is true he pulled it gently lest Rocinante should move,but try as he might to seat himself in the saddle, he had nothing for itbut to stand upright or pull his hand off. Then it was he wished for thesword of Amadis, against which no enchantment whatever had any power; thenhe cursed his ill fortune; then he magnified the loss the world wouldsustain by his absence while he remained there enchanted, for that hebelieved he was beyond all doubt; then he once more took to thinking ofhis beloved Dulcinea del Toboso; then he called to his worthy squireSancho Panza, who, buried in sleep and stretched upon the pack-saddle ofhis ass, was oblivious, at that moment, of the mother that bore him; thenhe called upon the sages Lirgandeo and Alquife to come to his aid; then heinvoked his good friend Urganda to succour him; and then, at last, morningfound him in such a state of desperation and perplexity that he wasbellowing like a bull, for he had no hope that day would bring any reliefto his suffering, which he believed would last for ever, inasmuch as hewas enchanted; and of this he was convinced by seeing that Rocinante neverstirred, much or little, and he felt persuaded that he and his horse wereto remain in this state, without eating or drinking or sleeping, until themalign influence of the stars was overpast, or until some other more sageenchanter should disenchant him.</p><p>But he was very much deceived in this conclusion, for daylight had hardlybegun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on horseback, wellequipped and accoutred, with firelocks across their saddle-bows. Theycalled out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn, which was stillshut; on seeing which, Don Quixote, even there where he was, did notforget to act as sentinel, and said in a loud and imperious tone,&ldquo;Knights, or squires, or whatever ye be, ye have no right to knock at thegates of this castle; for it is plain enough that they who are within areeither asleep, or else are not in the habit of throwing open the fortressuntil the sun&rsquo;s rays are spread over the whole surface of the earth.Withdraw to a distance, and wait till it is broad daylight, and then weshall see whether it will be proper or not to open to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What the devil fortress or castle is this,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;to make us standon such ceremony? If you are the innkeeper bid them open to us; we aretravellers who only want to feed our horses and go on, for we are inhaste.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?&rdquo; said DonQuixote.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you look like,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;but I know that youare talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A castle it is,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;nay, more, one of the best inthis whole province, and it has within it people who have had the sceptrein the hand and the crown on the head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It would be better if it were the other way,&rdquo; said the traveller, &ldquo;thesceptre on the head and the crown in the hand; but if so, maybe there iswithin some company of players, with whom it is a common thing to havethose crowns and sceptres you speak of; for in such a small inn as this,and where such silence is kept, I do not believe any people entitled tocrowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know but little of the world,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;since you areignorant of what commonly occurs in knight-errantry.&rdquo;</p><p>But the comrades of the spokesman, growing weary of the dialogue with DonQuixote, renewed their knocks with great vehemence, so much so that thehost, and not only he but everybody in the inn, awoke, and he got up toask who knocked. It happened at this moment that one of the horses of thefour who were seeking admittance went to smell Rocinante, who melancholy,dejected, and with drooping ears stood motionless, supporting his sorelystretched master; and as he was, after all, flesh, though he looked as ifhe were made of wood, he could not help giving way and in return smellingthe one who had come to offer him attentions. But he had hardly moved atall when Don Quixote lost his footing; and slipping off the saddle, hewould have come to the ground, but for being suspended by the arm, whichcaused him such agony that he believed either his wrist would be cutthrough or his arm torn off; and he hung so near the ground that he couldjust touch it with his feet, which was all the worse for him; for, findinghow little was wanted to enable him to plant his feet firmly, he struggledand stretched himself as much as he could to gain a footing; just likethose undergoing the torture of the strappado, when they are fixed at&ldquo;touch and no touch,&rdquo; who aggravate their own sufferings by their violentefforts to stretch themselves, deceived by the hope which makes them fancythat with a very little more they will reach the ground.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c43b" id="c43b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c43b.jpg (272K)" src="images/c43b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c43b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c43e" id="c43e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c43e.jpg (20K)" src="images/c43e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch44" id="ch44"></a>CHAPTER XLIV.<br/>IN WHICH ARE CONTINUED THE UNHEARD-OF ADVENTURES OF THE INN</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c44a" id="c44a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c44a.jpg (144K)" src="images/c44a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c44a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>So loud, in fact, were the shouts of Don Quixote, that the landlordopening the gate of the inn in all haste, came out in dismay, and ran tosee who was uttering such cries, and those who were outside joined him.Maritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the same outcry,suspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, without anyone seeing her,untied the halter by which Don Quixote was suspended, and down he came tothe ground in the sight of the landlord and the travellers, whoapproaching asked him what was the matter with him that he shouted so. Hewithout replying a word took the rope off his wrist, and rising to hisfeet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, put his lancein rest, and making a considerable circuit of the plain came back at ahalf-gallop exclaiming:</p><p>&ldquo;Whoever shall say that I have been enchanted with just cause, provided mylady the Princess Micomicona grants me permission to do so, I give him thelie, challenge him and defy him to single combat.&rdquo;</p><p>The newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of Don Quixote; butthe landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was, and not tomind him as he was out of his senses. They then asked the landlord if byany chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had come to that inn, onedressed like a muleteer, and of such and such an appearance, describingthat of Doña Clara&rsquo;s lover. The landlord replied that there were so manypeople in the inn he had not noticed the person they were inquiring for;but one of them observing the coach in which the Judge had come, said, &ldquo;Heis here no doubt, for this is the coach he is following: let one of usstay at the gate, and the rest go in to look for him; or indeed it wouldbe as well if one of us went round the inn, lest he should escape over thewall of the yard.&rdquo; &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said another; and while two of them wentin, one remained at the gate and the other made the circuit of the inn;observing all which, the landlord was unable to conjecture for what reasonthey were taking all these precautions, though he understood they werelooking for the youth whose description they had given him.</p><p>It was by this time broad daylight; and for that reason, as well as inconsequence of the noise Don Quixote had made, everybody was awake and up,but particularly Doña Clara and Dorothea; for they had been able to sleepbut badly that night, the one from agitation at having her lover so nearher, the other from curiosity to see him. Don Quixote, when he saw thatnot one of the four travellers took any notice of him or replied to hischallenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation and wrath; and ifhe could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was lawful for aknight-errant to undertake or engage in another enterprise, when he hadplighted his word and faith not to involve himself in any until he hadmade an end of the one to which he was pledged, he would have attacked thewhole of them, and would have made them return an answer in spite ofthemselves. But considering that it would not become him, nor be right, tobegin any new emprise until he had established Micomicona in her kingdom,he was constrained to hold his peace and wait quietly to see what would bethe upshot of the proceedings of those same travellers; one of whom foundthe youth they were seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer,without a thought of anyone coming in search of him, much less findinghim.</p><p>The man laid hold of him by the arm, saying, &ldquo;It becomes you well indeed,Señor Don Luis, to be in the dress you wear, and well the bed in which Ifind you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared you.&rdquo;</p><p>The youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who heldhim, but presently recognised him as one of his father&rsquo;s servants, atwhich he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or uttera word; while the servant went on to say, &ldquo;There is nothing for it now,Señor Don Luis, but to submit quietly and return home, unless it is yourwish that my lord, your father, should take his departure for the otherworld, for nothing else can be the consequence of the grief he is in atyour absence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this dress?&rdquo;said Don Luis.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a student to whom you confided your intentions,&rdquo; answered theservant, &ldquo;that disclosed them, touched with pity at the distress he sawyour father suffer on missing you; he therefore despatched four of hisservants in quest of you, and here we all are at your service, betterpleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able torestore you to those eyes that so yearn for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That shall be as I please, or as heaven orders,&rdquo; returned Don Luis.</p><p>&ldquo;What can you please or heaven order,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;except to agree togo back? Anything else is impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>All this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer atwhose side Don Luis lay, and rising, he went to report what had takenplace to Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the others, who had by this timedressed themselves; and told them how the man had addressed the youth as&ldquo;Don,&rdquo; and what words had passed, and how he wanted him to return to hisfather, which the youth was unwilling to do. With this, and what theyalready knew of the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him, they allfelt very anxious to know more particularly who he was, and even to helphim if it was attempted to employ force against him; so they hastened towhere he was still talking and arguing with his servant. Dorothea at thisinstant came out of her room, followed by Doña Clara all in a tremor; andcalling Cardenio aside, she told him in a few words the story of themusician and Doña Clara, and he at the same time told her what hadhappened, how his father&rsquo;s servants had come in search of him; but intelling her so, he did not speak low enough but that Doña Clara heard whathe said, at which she was so much agitated that had not Dorothea hastenedto support her she would have fallen to the ground. Cardenio then badeDorothea return to her room, as he would endeavour to make the wholematter right, and they did as he desired. All the four who had come inquest of Don Luis had now come into the inn and surrounded him, urging himto return and console his father at once and without a moment&rsquo;s delay. Hereplied that he could not do so on any account until he had concluded somebusiness in which his life, honour, and heart were at stake. The servantspressed him, saying that most certainly they would not return without him,and that they would take him away whether he liked it or not.</p><p>&ldquo;You shall not do that,&rdquo; replied Don Luis, &ldquo;unless you take me dead;though however you take me, it will be without life.&rdquo;</p><p>By this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the dispute,but particularly Cardenio, Don Fernando, his companions, the Judge, thecurate, the barber, and Don Quixote; for he now considered there was nonecessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer. Cardenio beingalready acquainted with the young man&rsquo;s story, asked the men who wanted totake him away, what object they had in seeking to carry off this youthagainst his will.</p><p>&ldquo;Our object,&rdquo; said one of the four, &ldquo;is to save the life of his father,who is in danger of losing it through this gentleman&rsquo;s disappearance.&rdquo;</p><p>Upon this Don Luis exclaimed, &ldquo;There is no need to make my affairs publichere; I am free, and I will return if I please; and if not, none of youshall compel me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reason will compel your worship,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;and if it has no powerover you, it has power over us, to make us do what we came for, and whatit is our duty to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us hear what the whole affair is about,&rdquo; said the Judge at this; butthe man, who knew him as a neighbour of theirs, replied, &ldquo;Do you not knowthis gentleman, Señor Judge? He is the son of your neighbour, who has runaway from his father&rsquo;s house in a dress so unbecoming his rank, as yourworship may perceive.&rdquo;</p><p>The judge on this looked at him more carefully and recognised him, andembracing him said, &ldquo;What folly is this, Señor Don Luis, or what can havebeen the cause that could have induced you to come here in this way, andin this dress, which so ill becomes your condition?&rdquo;</p><p>Tears came into the eyes of the young man, and he was unable to utter aword in reply to the Judge, who told the four servants not to be uneasy,for all would be satisfactorily settled; and then taking Don Luis by thehand, he drew him aside and asked the reason of his having come there.</p><p>But while he was questioning him they heard a loud outcry at the gate ofthe inn, the cause of which was that two of the guests who had passed thenight there, seeing everybody busy about finding out what it was the fourmen wanted, had conceived the idea of going off without paying what theyowed; but the landlord, who minded his own affairs more than otherpeople&rsquo;s, caught them going out of the gate and demanded his reckoning,abusing them for their dishonesty with such language that he drove them toreply with their fists, and so they began to lay on him in such a stylethat the poor man was forced to cry out, and call for help. The landladyand her daughter could see no one more free to give aid than Don Quixote,and to him the daughter said, &ldquo;Sir knight, by the virtue God has givenyou, help my poor father, for two wicked men are beating him to a mummy.&rdquo;</p><p>To which Don Quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied, &ldquo;Fairdamsel, at the present moment your request is inopportune, for I amdebarred from involving myself in any adventure until I have brought to ahappy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me; but that which I cando for you is what I will now mention: run and tell your father to standhis ground as well as he can in this battle, and on no account to allowhimself to be vanquished, while I go and request permission of thePrincess Micomicona to enable me to succour him in his distress; and ifshe grants it, rest assured I will relieve him from it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sinner that I am,&rdquo; exclaimed Maritornes, who stood by; &ldquo;before you havegot your permission my master will be in the other world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give me leave, señora, to obtain the permission I speak of,&rdquo; returned DonQuixote; &ldquo;and if I get it, it will matter very little if he is in theother world; for I will rescue him thence in spite of all the same worldcan do; or at any rate I will give you such a revenge over those who shallhave sent him there that you will be more than moderately satisfied;&rdquo; andwithout saying anything more he went and knelt before Dorothea, requestingher Highness in knightly and errant phrase to be pleased to grant himpermission to aid and succour the castellan of that castle, who now stoodin grievous jeopardy. The princess granted it graciously, and he at once,bracing his buckler on his arm and drawing his sword, hastened to theinn-gate, where the two guests were still handling the landlord roughly;but as soon as he reached the spot he stopped short and stood still,though Maritornes and the landlady asked him why he hesitated to helptheir master and husband.</p><p>&ldquo;I hesitate,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;because it is not lawful for me to drawsword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squire Sancho tome; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and business.&rdquo;</p><p>Thus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very lively exchangeof fisticuffs and punches, to the sore damage of the landlord and to thewrath of Maritornes, the landlady, and her daughter, who were furious whenthey saw the pusillanimity of Don Quixote, and the hard treatment theirmaster, husband and father was undergoing. But let us leave him there; forhe will surely find someone to help him, and if not, let him suffer andhold his tongue who attempts more than his strength allows him to do; andlet us go back fifty paces to see what Don Luis said in reply to the Judgewhom we left questioning him privately as to his reasons for coming onfoot and so meanly dressed.</p><p>To which the youth, pressing his hand in a way that showed his heart wastroubled by some great sorrow, and shedding a flood of tears, made answer:</p><p>&ldquo;Señor, I have no more to tell you than that from the moment when, throughheaven&rsquo;s will and our being near neighbours, I first saw Doña Clara, yourdaughter and my lady, from that instant I made her the mistress of mywill, and if yours, my true lord and father, offers no impediment, thisvery day she shall become my wife. For her I left my father&rsquo;s house, andfor her I assumed this disguise, to follow her whithersoever she may go,as the arrow seeks its mark or the sailor the pole-star. She knows nothingmore of my passion than what she may have learned from having sometimesseen from a distance that my eyes were filled with tears. You knowalready, señor, the wealth and noble birth of my parents, and that I amtheir sole heir; if this be a sufficient inducement for you to venture tomake me completely happy, accept me at once as your son; for if my father,influenced by other objects of his own, should disapprove of thishappiness I have sought for myself, time has more power to alter andchange things, than human will.&rdquo;</p><p>With this the love-smitten youth was silent, while the Judge, afterhearing him, was astonished, perplexed, and surprised, as well at themanner and intelligence with which Don Luis had confessed the secret ofhis heart, as at the position in which he found himself, not knowing whatcourse to take in a matter so sudden and unexpected. All the answer,therefore, he gave him was to bid him to make his mind easy for thepresent, and arrange with his servants not to take him back that day, sothat there might be time to consider what was best for all parties. DonLuis kissed his hands by force, nay, bathed them with his tears, in a waythat would have touched a heart of marble, not to say that of the Judge,who, as a shrewd man, had already perceived how advantageous the marriagewould be to his daughter; though, were it possible, he would havepreferred that it should be brought about with the consent of the fatherof Don Luis, who he knew looked for a title for his son.</p><p>The guests had by this time made peace with the landlord, for, bypersuasion and Don Quixote&rsquo;s fair words more than by threats, they hadpaid him what he demanded, and the servants of Don Luis were waiting forthe end of the conversation with the Judge and their master&rsquo;s decision,when the devil, who never sleeps, contrived that the barber, from whom DonQuixote had taken Mambrino&rsquo;s helmet, and Sancho Panza the trappings of hisass in exchange for those of his own, should at this instant enter theinn; which said barber, as he led his ass to the stable, observed SanchoPanza engaged in repairing something or other belonging to thepack-saddle; and the moment he saw it he knew it, and made bold to attackSancho, exclaiming, &ldquo;Ho, sir thief, I have caught you! hand over my basinand my pack-saddle, and all my trappings that you robbed me of.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho, finding himself so unexpectedly assailed, and hearing the abusepoured upon him, seized the pack-saddle with one hand, and with the othergave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood. The barber,however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made in thepack-saddle; on the contrary, he raised such an outcry that everyone inthe inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel meant. &ldquo;Here, inthe name of the king and justice!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;this thief and highwaymanwants to kill me for trying to recover my property.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You lie,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;I am no highwayman; it was in fair war my masterDon Quixote won these spoils.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see hissquire&rsquo;s stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that time forthhe reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dub him aknight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling sure thatthe order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him.</p><p>In the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said,&ldquo;Gentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death, and Iknow it as well as if I had given birth to it, and here is my ass in thestable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does not fit himlike a glove, call me a rascal; and what is more, the same day I wasrobbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin, never yethandselled, that would fetch a crown any day.&rdquo;</p><p>At this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; and interposingbetween the two, and separating them, he placed the pack-saddle on theground, to lie there in sight until the truth was established, and said,&ldquo;Your worships may perceive clearly and plainly the error under which thisworthy squire lies when he calls a basin which was, is, and shall be thehelmet of Mambrino which I won from him in fair war, and made myself masterof by legitimate and lawful possession. With the pack-saddle I do notconcern myself; but I may tell you on that head that my squire Sanchoasked my permission to strip off the caparison of this vanquishedpoltroon&rsquo;s steed, and with it adorn his own; I allowed him, and he tookit; and as to its having been changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle,I can give no explanation except the usual one, that such transformationswill take place in adventures of chivalry. To confirm all which, run,Sancho my son, and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls abasin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Egad, master,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;if we have no other proof of our case thanwhat your worship puts forward, Mambrino&rsquo;s helmet is just as much a basinas this good fellow&rsquo;s caparison is a pack-saddle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do as I bid thee,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;it cannot be that everything inthis castle goes by enchantment.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him, andwhen Don Quixote saw it, he took hold of it and said:</p><p>&ldquo;Your worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that thisis a basin and not the helmet I told you of; and I swear by the order ofchivalry I profess, that this helmet is the identical one I took from him,without anything added to or taken from it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no doubt of that,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for from the timemy master won it until now he has only fought one battle in it, when he letloose those unlucky men in chains; and if it had not been for this basin-helmethe would not have come off over well that time, for there was plenty ofstone-throwing in that affair.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c44e" id="c44e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c44e.jpg (13K)" src="images/c44e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch45" id="ch45"></a>CHAPTER XLV.<br/>IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO&rsquo;S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE ISFINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND EARNEST</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c45a" id="c45a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c45a.jpg (154K)" src="images/c45a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c45a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What do you think now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;of what thesegentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And whoever says the contrary,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;I will let him know helies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again athousand times.&rdquo;</p><p>Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote&rsquo;shumour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion andcarry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the otherbarber he said:</p><p>&ldquo;Señor barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to yourprofession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twentyyears, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of them,perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days ofmy youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiecewith a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I meant to say tosoldiers&rsquo; arms; and I say&mdash;saving better opinions and always withsubmission to sounder judgments&mdash;that this piece we have now beforeus, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no barber&rsquo;sbasin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth fromfalsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is not acomplete helmet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for half of it is wanting, that is tosay the beaver.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; said the curate, who saw the object of his friend thebarber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with him, andeven the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis&rsquo;s affair,would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so taken up with theserious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no attention tothese facetious proceedings.</p><p>&ldquo;God bless me!&rdquo; exclaimed their butt the barber at this; &ldquo;is it possiblethat such an honourable company can say that this is not a basin but ahelmet? Why, this is a thing that would astonish a whole university,however wise it might be! That will do; if this basin is a helmet, why,then the pack-saddle must be a horse&rsquo;s caparison, as this gentleman hassaid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To me it looks like a pack-saddle,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but I have alreadysaid that with that question I do not concern myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;it isonly for Señor Don Quixote to say; for in these matters of chivalry allthese gentlemen and I bow to his authority.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;so many strange things havehappened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which I havesojourned in it, that I will not venture to assert anything positively inreply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is my beliefthat everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment. The firsttime, an enchanted Moor that there is in it gave me sore trouble, nor didSancho fare well among certain followers of his; and last night I was kepthanging by this arm for nearly two hours, without knowing how or why Icame by such a mishap. So that now, for me to come forward to give anopinion in such a puzzling matter, would be to risk a rash decision. Asregards the assertion that this is a basin and not a helmet I have alreadygiven an answer; but as to the question whether this is a pack-saddle or acaparison I will not venture to give a positive opinion, but will leave itto your worships&rsquo; better judgment. Perhaps as you are not dubbed knightslike myself, the enchantments of this place have nothing to do with you,and your faculties are unfettered, and you can see things in this castleas they really and truly are, and not as they appear to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There can be no question,&rdquo; said Don Fernando on this, &ldquo;but that Señor DonQuixote has spoken very wisely, and that with us rests the decision ofthis matter; and that we may have surer ground to go on, I will take thevotes of the gentlemen in secret, and declare the result clearly andfully.&rdquo;</p><p>To those who were in on the secret of Don Quixote&rsquo;s humour all this affordedgreat amusement; but to those who knew nothing about it, it seemed thegreatest nonsense in the world, in particular to the four servants of DonLuis, as well as to Don Luis himself, and to three other travellers whohad by chance come to the inn, and had the appearance of officers of theHoly Brotherhood, as indeed they were; but the one who above all was athis wits&rsquo; end was the barber whose basin, there before his very eyes, had beenturned into Mambrino&rsquo;s helmet, and whose pack-saddle he had no doubtwhatever was about to become a rich caparison for a horse. All laughed tosee Don Fernando going from one to another collecting the votes, andwhispering to them to give him their private opinion whether the treasureover which there had been so much fighting was a pack-saddle or acaparison; but after he had taken the votes of those who knew Don Quixote,he said aloud, &ldquo;The fact is, my good fellow, that I am tired collectingsuch a number of opinions, for I find that there is not one of whom I askwhat I desire to know, who does not tell me that it is absurd to say thatthis is the pack-saddle of an ass, and not the caparison of a horse, nay,of a thoroughbred horse; so you must submit, for, in spite of you and yourass, this is a caparison and no pack-saddle, and you have stated andproved your case very badly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May I never share heaven,&rdquo; said the poor barber, &ldquo;if your worships arenot all mistaken; and may my soul appear before God as that appears to mea pack-saddle and not a caparison; but, &lsquo;laws go,&rsquo;&mdash;I say no more;and indeed I am not drunk, for I am fasting, except it be from sin.&rdquo;</p><p>The simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than theabsurdities of Don Quixote, who now observed:</p><p>&ldquo;There is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs tohim, and to whom God has given it, may St. Peter add his blessing.&rdquo;</p><p>But said one of the four servants, &ldquo;Unless, indeed, this is a deliberatejoke, I cannot bring myself to believe that men so intelligent as thosepresent are, or seem to be, can venture to declare and assert that this isnot a basin, and that not a pack-saddle; but as I perceive that they doassert and declare it, I can only come to the conclusion that there issome mystery in this persistence in what is so opposed to the evidence ofexperience and truth itself; for I swear by&rdquo;&mdash;and here he rapped outa round oath&mdash;&ldquo;all the people in the world will not make me believethat this is not a barber&rsquo;s basin and that a jackass&rsquo;s pack-saddle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It might easily be a she-ass&rsquo;s,&rdquo; observed the curate.</p><p>&ldquo;It is all the same,&rdquo; said the servant; &ldquo;that is not the point; butwhether it is or is not a pack-saddle, as your worships say.&rdquo;</p><p>On hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the Brotherhood, whohad been listening to the dispute and controversy, unable to restrain hisanger and impatience, exclaimed, &ldquo;It is a pack-saddle as sure as my fatheris my father, and whoever has said or will say anything else must bedrunk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You lie like a rascally clown,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote; and lifting hispike, which he had never let out of his hand, he delivered such a blow athis head that, had not the officer dodged it, it would have stretched himat full length. The pike was shivered in pieces against the ground, andthe rest of the officers, seeing their comrade assaulted, raised a shout,calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood. The landlord, who was of thefraternity, ran at once to fetch his staff of office and his sword, andranged himself on the side of his comrades; the servants of Don Luisclustered round him, lest he should escape from them in the confusion; thebarber, seeing the house turned upside down, once more laid hold of hispack-saddle and Sancho did the same; Don Quixote drew his sword andcharged the officers; Don Luis cried out to his servants to leave himalone and go and help Don Quixote, and Cardenio and Don Fernando, who weresupporting him; the curate was shouting at the top of his voice, thelandlady was screaming, her daughter was wailing, Maritornes was weeping,Dorothea was aghast, Luscinda terror-stricken, and Doña Clara in a faint.The barber cudgelled Sancho, and Sancho pommelled the barber; Don Luisgave one of his servants, who ventured to catch him by the arm to keep himfrom escaping, a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood; the Judge took hispart; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and was belabouringhim heartily; the landlord raised his voice again calling for help for theHoly Brotherhood; so that the whole inn was nothing but cries, shouts,shrieks, confusion, terror, dismay, mishaps, sword-cuts, fisticuffs,cudgellings, kicks, and bloodshed; and in the midst of all this chaos,complication, and general entanglement, Don Quixote took it into his headthat he had been plunged into the thick of the discord of Agramante&rsquo;scamp; and, in a voice that shook the inn like thunder, he cried out:</p><p>&ldquo;Hold all, let all sheathe their swords, let all be calm and attend to meas they value their lives!&rdquo;</p><p>All paused at his mighty voice, and he went on to say, &ldquo;Did I not tellyou, sirs, that this castle was enchanted, and that a legion or so ofdevils dwelt in it? In proof whereof I call upon you to behold with yourown eyes how the discord of Agramante&rsquo;s camp has come hither, and beentransferred into the midst of us. See how they fight, there for the sword,here for the horse, on that side for the eagle, on this for the helmet; weare all fighting, and all at cross purposes. Come then, you, Señor Judge,and you, señor curate; let the one represent King Agramante and the otherKing Sobrino, and make peace among us; for by God Almighty it is a sorrybusiness that so many persons of quality as we are should slay one anotherfor such trifling cause.&rdquo; The officers, who did not understand DonQuixote&rsquo;s mode of speaking, and found themselves roughly handled by DonFernando, Cardenio, and their companions, were not to be appeased; thebarber was, however, for both his beard and his pack-saddle were the worsefor the struggle; Sancho like a good servant obeyed the slightest word ofhis master; while the four servants of Don Luis kept quiet when they sawhow little they gained by not being so. The landlord alone insisted uponit that they must punish the insolence of this madman, who at every turnraised a disturbance in the inn; but at length the uproar was stilled forthe present; the pack-saddle remained a caparison till the day ofjudgment, and the basin a helmet and the inn a castle in Don Quixote&rsquo;simagination.</p><p>All having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of theJudge and the curate, the servants of Don Luis began again to urge him toreturn with them at once; and while he was discussing the matter withthem, the Judge took counsel with Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the curateas to what he ought to do in the case, telling them how it stood, and whatDon Luis had said to him. It was agreed at length that Don Fernando shouldtell the servants of Don Luis who he was, and that it was his desire thatDon Luis should accompany him to Andalusia, where he would receive fromthe marquis his brother the welcome his quality entitled him to; for,otherwise, it was easy to see from the determination of Don Luis that hewould not return to his father at present, though they tore him to pieces.On learning the rank of Don Fernando and the resolution of Don Luis thefour then settled it between themselves that three of them should returnto tell his father how matters stood, and that the other should remain towait upon Don Luis, and not leave him until they came back for him, or hisfather&rsquo;s orders were known. Thus by the authority of Agramante and thewisdom of King Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; butthe enemy of concord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and madea fool of, and seeing how little he had gained after having involved themall in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his hand once moreby stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances.</p><p>It came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning therank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from thecontest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likely toget the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had beenthrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some warrantshe carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one against DonQuixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for settingthe galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very good reason, apprehended.Suspecting how it was, then, he wished to satisfy himself as to whetherDon Quixote&rsquo;s features corresponded; and taking a parchment out of hisbosom he lit upon what he was in search of, and setting himself to read itdeliberately, for he was not a quick reader, as he made out each word hefixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and went on comparing the description inthe warrant with his face, and discovered that beyond all doubt he was theperson described in it. As soon as he had satisfied himself, folding upthe parchment, he took the warrant in his left hand and with his rightseized Don Quixote by the collar so tightly that he did not allow him tobreathe, and shouted aloud, &ldquo;Help for the Holy Brotherhood! and that youmay see I demand it in earnest, read this warrant which says thishighwayman is to be arrested.&rdquo;</p><p>The curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was true,and that it agreed with Don Quixote&rsquo;s appearance, who, on his part, whenhe found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown, worked up to thehighest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking with rage, with bothhands seized the officer by the throat with all his might, so that had henot been helped by his comrades he would have yielded up his life ere DonQuixote released his hold. The landlord, who had perforce to support hisbrother officers, ran at once to aid them. The landlady, when she saw herhusband engaged in a fresh quarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and itsnote was immediately caught up by Maritornes and her daughter, callingupon heaven and all present for help; and Sancho, seeing what was goingon, exclaimed, &ldquo;By the Lord, it is quite true what my master says aboutthe enchantments of this castle, for it is impossible to live an hour inpeace in it!&rdquo;</p><p>Don Fernando parted the officer and Don Quixote, and to their mutualcontentment made them relax the grip by which they held, the one the coatcollar, the other the throat of his adversary; for all this, however, theofficers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call on them to help,and deliver him over bound into their power, as was required for theservice of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood, on whose behalf theyagain demanded aid and assistance to effect the capture of this robber andfootpad of the highways.</p><p>Don Quixote smiled when he heard these words, and said very calmly, &ldquo;Comenow, base, ill-born brood; call ye it highway robbery to give freedom tothose in bondage, to release the captives, to succour the miserable, toraise up the fallen, to relieve the needy? Infamous beings, who by yourvile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven should not make known toyou the virtue that lies in knight-errantry, or show you the sin andignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to respect the shadow, not to saythe presence, of any knight-errant! Come now; band, not of officers, butof thieves; footpads with the licence of the Holy Brotherhood; tell me whowas the ignoramus who signed a warrant of arrest against such a knight asI am? Who was he that did not know that knights-errant are independent ofall jurisdictions, that their law is their sword, their charter theirprowess, and their edicts their will? Who, I say again, was the fool thatknows not that there are no letters patent of nobility that confer suchprivileges or exemptions as a knight-errant acquires the day he is dubbeda knight, and devotes himself to the arduous calling of chivalry? Whatknight-errant ever paid poll-tax, duty, queen&rsquo;s pin-money, king&rsquo;s dues,toll or ferry? What tailor ever took payment of him for making hisclothes? What castellan that received him in his castle ever made him payhis shot? What king did not seat him at his table? What damsel was notenamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to his will andpleasure? And, lastly, what knight-errant has there been, is there, orwill there ever be in the world, not bold enough to give, single-handed,four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the Holy Brotherhoodif they come in his way?&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch46" id="ch46"></a>CHAPTER XLVI.<br/>OF THE END OF THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HOLYBROTHERHOOD; AND OF THE GREAT FEROCITY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT, DON QUIXOTE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c46a" id="c46a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c46a.jpg (163K)" src="images/c46a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c46a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>While Don Quixote was talking in this strain, the curate was endeavouringto persuade the officers that he was out of his senses, as they mightperceive by his deeds and his words, and that they need not press thematter any further, for even if they arrested him and carried him off,they would have to release him by-and-by as a madman; to which the holderof the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with inquiring into DonQuixote&rsquo;s madness, but only to execute his superior&rsquo;s orders, and thatonce taken they might let him go three hundred times if they liked.</p><p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;you must not take him away this time,nor will he, it is my opinion, let himself be taken away.&rdquo;</p><p>In short, the curate used such arguments, and Don Quixote did such madthings, that the officers would have been more mad than he was if they hadnot perceived his want of wits, and so they thought it best to allowthemselves to be pacified, and even to act as peacemakers between thebarber and Sancho Panza, who still continued their altercation with muchbitterness. In the end they, as officers of justice, settled the questionby arbitration in such a manner that both sides were, if not perfectlycontented, at least to some extent satisfied; for they changed thepack-saddles, but not the girths or head-stalls; and as to Mambrino&rsquo;shelmet, the curate, under the rose and without Don Quixote&rsquo;s knowing it,paid eight reals for the basin, and the barber executed a full receipt andengagement to make no further demand then or thenceforth for evermore,amen. These two disputes, which were the most important and gravest, beingsettled, it only remained for the servants of Don Luis to consent thatthree of them should return while one was left to accompany him whitherDon Fernando desired to take him; and good luck and better fortune, havingalready begun to solve difficulties and remove obstructions in favour ofthe lovers and warriors of the inn, were pleased to persevere and bringeverything to a happy issue; for the servants agreed to do as Don Luiswished; which gave Doña Clara such happiness that no one could have lookedinto her face just then without seeing the joy of her heart. Zoraida,though she did not fully comprehend all she saw, was grave or gay withoutknowing why, as she watched and studied the various countenances, butparticularly her Spaniard&rsquo;s, whom she followed with her eyes and clung towith her soul. The gift and compensation which the curate gave the barberhad not escaped the landlord&rsquo;s notice, and he demanded Don Quixote&rsquo;sreckoning, together with the amount of the damage to his wine-skins, andthe loss of his wine, swearing that neither Rocinante nor Sancho&rsquo;s assshould leave the inn until he had been paid to the very last farthing. Thecurate settled all amicably, and Don Fernando paid; though the Judge hadalso very readily offered to pay the score; and all became so peaceful andquiet that the inn no longer reminded one of the discord of Agramante&rsquo;scamp, as Don Quixote said, but of the peace and tranquillity of the daysof Octavianus: for all which it was the universal opinion that theirthanks were due to the great zeal and eloquence of the curate, and to theunexampled generosity of Don Fernando.</p><p>Finding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels, his squire&rsquo;s as wellas his own, Don Quixote considered that it would be advisable to continuethe journey he had begun, and bring to a close that great adventure forwhich he had been called and chosen; and with this high resolve he wentand knelt before Dorothea, who, however, would not allow him to utter aword until he had risen; so to obey her he rose, and said, &ldquo;It is a commonproverb, fair lady, that &lsquo;diligence is the mother of good fortune,&rsquo; andexperience has often shown in important affairs that the earnestness ofthe negotiator brings the doubtful case to a successful termination; butin nothing does this truth show itself more plainly than in war, wherequickness and activity forestall the devices of the enemy, and win thevictory before the foe has time to defend himself. All this I say, exaltedand esteemed lady, because it seems to me that for us to remain any longerin this castle now is useless, and may be injurious to us in a way that weshall find out some day; for who knows but that your enemy the giant mayhave learned by means of secret and diligent spies that I am going todestroy him, and if the opportunity be given him he may seize it tofortify himself in some impregnable castle or stronghold, against whichall my efforts and the might of my indefatigable arm may avail but little?Therefore, lady, let us, as I say, forestall his schemes by our activity,and let us depart at once in quest of fair fortune; for your highness isonly kept from enjoying it as fully as you could desire by my delay inencountering your adversary.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote held his peace and said no more, calmly awaiting the reply ofthe beauteous princess, who, with commanding dignity and in a styleadapted to Don Quixote&rsquo;s own, replied to him in these words, &ldquo;I give youthanks, sir knight, for the eagerness you, like a good knight to whom itis a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the needy, display toafford me aid in my sore trouble; and heaven grant that your wishes andmine may be realised, so that you may see that there are women in thisworld capable of gratitude; as to my departure, let it be forthwith, for Ihave no will but yours; dispose of me entirely in accordance with yourgood pleasure; for she who has once entrusted to you the defence of herperson, and placed in your hands the recovery of her dominions, must notthink of offering opposition to that which your wisdom may ordain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On, then, in God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;for, when a lady humblesherself to me, I will not lose the opportunity of raising her up andplacing her on the throne of her ancestors. Let us depart at once, for thecommon saying that in delay there is danger, lends spurs to my eagernessto take the road; and as neither heaven has created nor hell seen any thatcan daunt or intimidate me, saddle Rocinante, Sancho, and get ready thyass and the queen&rsquo;s palfrey, and let us take leave of the castellan andthese gentlemen, and go hence this very instant.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho, who was standing by all the time, said, shaking his head, &ldquo;Ah!master, master, there is more mischief in the village than one hears of,begging all good bodies&rsquo; pardon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What mischief can there be in any village, or in all the cities of theworld, you booby, that can hurt my reputation?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;If your worship is angry,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;I will hold my tongue andleave unsaid what as a good squire I am bound to say, and what a goodservant should tell his master.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say what thou wilt,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;provided thy words be notmeant to work upon my fears; for thou, if thou fearest, art behaving likethyself; but I like myself, in not fearing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is nothing of the sort, as I am a sinner before God,&rdquo; said Sancho,&ldquo;but that I take it to be sure and certain that this lady, who callsherself queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon, is no more so than mymother; for, if she was what she says, she would not go rubbing noses withone that is here every instant and behind every door.&rdquo;</p><p>Dorothea turned red at Sancho&rsquo;s words, for the truth was that her husbandDon Fernando had now and then, when the others were not looking, gatheredfrom her lips some of the reward his love had earned, and Sancho seeingthis had considered that such freedom was more like a courtesan than aqueen of a great kingdom; she, however, being unable or not caring toanswer him, allowed him to proceed, and he continued, &ldquo;This I say, señor,because, if after we have travelled roads and highways, and passed badnights and worse days, one who is now enjoying himself in this inn is toreap the fruit of our labours, there is no need for me to be in a hurry tosaddle Rocinante, put the pad on the ass, or get ready the palfrey; for itwill be better for us to stay quiet, and let every jade mind her spinning,and let us go to dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>Good God, what was the indignation of Don Quixote when he heard theaudacious words of his squire! So great was it, that in a voiceinarticulate with rage, with a stammering tongue, and eyes that flashedliving fire, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Rascally clown, boorish, insolent, andignorant, ill-spoken, foul-mouthed, impudent backbiter and slanderer! Hastthou dared to utter such words in my presence and in that of theseillustrious ladies? Hast thou dared to harbour such gross and shamelessthoughts in thy muddled imagination? Begone from my presence, thou bornmonster, storehouse of lies, hoard of untruths, garner of knaveries,inventor of scandals, publisher of absurdities, enemy of the respect dueto royal personages! Begone, show thyself no more before me under pain ofmy wrath;&rdquo; and so saying he knitted his brows, puffed out his cheeks,gazed around him, and stamped on the ground violently with his right foot,showing in every way the rage that was pent up in his heart; and at hiswords and furious gestures Sancho was so scared and terrified that hewould have been glad if the earth had opened that instant and swallowedhim, and his only thought was to turn round and make his escape from theangry presence of his master.</p><p>But the ready-witted Dorothea, who by this time so well understood DonQuixote&rsquo;s humour, said, to mollify his wrath, &ldquo;Be not irritated at theabsurdities your good squire has uttered, Sir Knight of the RuefulCountenance, for perhaps he did not utter them without cause, and from hisgood sense and Christian conscience it is not likely that he would bearfalse witness against anyone. We may therefore believe, without anyhesitation, that since, as you say, sir knight, everything in this castlegoes and is brought about by means of enchantment, Sancho, I say, maypossibly have seen, through this diabolical medium, what he says he saw somuch to the detriment of my modesty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I swear by God Omnipotent,&rdquo; exclaimed Don Quixote at this, &ldquo;your highnesshas hit the point; and that some vile illusion must have come before thissinner of a Sancho, that made him see what it would have been impossibleto see by any other means than enchantments; for I know well enough, fromthe poor fellow&rsquo;s goodness and harmlessness, that he is incapable ofbearing false witness against anybody.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;True, no doubt,&rdquo; said Don Fernando, &ldquo;for which reason, SeñorDon Quixote, you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of yourfavour, <i>sicut erat in principio</i>, before illusions of this sort had takenaway his senses.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote said he was ready to pardon him, and the curate went forSancho, who came in very humbly, and falling on his knees begged for thehand of his master, who having presented it to him and allowed him to kissit, gave him his blessing and said, &ldquo;Now, Sancho my son, thou wilt beconvinced of the truth of what I have many a time told thee, thateverything in this castle is done by means of enchantment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it is, I believe,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;except the affair of the blanket,which came to pass in reality by ordinary means.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Believe it not,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for had it been so, I would haveavenged thee that instant, or even now; but neither then nor now could I,nor have I seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>They were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was, and thelandlord gave them a minute account of Sancho&rsquo;s flights, at which theylaughed not a little, and at which Sancho would have been no less out ofcountenance had not his master once more assured him it was allenchantment. For all that his simplicity never reached so high a pitchthat he could persuade himself it was not the plain and simple truth,without any deception whatever about it, that he had been blanketed bybeings of flesh and blood, and not by visionary and imaginary phantoms, ashis master believed and protested.</p><p>The illustrious company had now been two days in the inn; and as it seemedto them time to depart, they devised a plan so that, without givingDorothea and Don Fernando the trouble of going back with Don Quixote tohis village under pretence of restoring Queen Micomicona, the curate andthe barber might carry him away with them as they proposed, and the curatebe able to take his madness in hand at home; and in pursuance of theirplan they arranged with the owner of an oxcart who happened to be passingthat way to carry him after this fashion. They constructed a kind of cagewith wooden bars, large enough to hold Don Quixote comfortably; and thenDon Fernando and his companions, the servants of Don Luis, and theofficers of the Brotherhood, together with the landlord, by the directionsand advice of the curate, covered their faces and disguised themselves,some in one way, some in another, so as to appear to Don Quixote quitedifferent from the persons he had seen in the castle. This done, inprofound silence they entered the room where he was asleep, taking hisrest after the past frays, and advancing to where he was sleepingtranquilly, not dreaming of anything of the kind happening, they seizedhim firmly and bound him fast hand and foot, so that, when he awokestartled, he was unable to move, and could only marvel and wonder at thestrange figures he saw before him; upon which he at once gave way to theidea which his crazed fancy invariably conjured up before him, and took itinto his head that all these shapes were phantoms of the enchanted castle,and that he himself was unquestionably enchanted as he could neither movenor help himself; precisely what the curate, the concoctor of the scheme,expected would happen. Of all that were there Sancho was the only one whowas at once in his senses and in his own proper character, and he, thoughhe was within very little of sharing his master&rsquo;s infirmity, did not failto perceive who all these disguised figures were; but he did not dare toopen his lips until he saw what came of this assault and capture of hismaster; nor did the latter utter a word, waiting to the upshot of hismishap; which was that bringing in the cage, they shut him up in it andnailed the bars so firmly that they could not be easily burst open.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c46b" id="c46b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c46b.jpg (342K)" src="images/c46b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c46b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>They then took him on their shoulders, and as they passed out of the rooman awful voice&mdash;as much so as the barber, not he of the pack-saddlebut the other, was able to make it&mdash;was heard to say, &ldquo;O Knight ofthe Rueful Countenance, let not this captivity in which thou art placedafflict thee, for this must needs be, for the more speedy accomplishmentof the adventure in which thy great heart has engaged thee; the whichshall be accomplished when the raging Manchegan lion and the white Tobosandove shall be linked together, having first humbled their haughty necks tothe gentle yoke of matrimony. And from this marvellous union shall comeforth to the light of the world brave whelps that shall rival the raveningclaws of their valiant father; and this shall come to pass ere the pursuerof the flying nymph shall in his swift natural course have twice visitedthe starry signs. And thou, O most noble and obedient squire that everbore sword at side, beard on face, or nose to smell with, be not dismayedor grieved to see the flower of knight-errantry carried away thus beforethy very eyes; for soon, if it so please the Framer of the universe, thoushalt see thyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt not knowthyself, and the promises which thy good master has made thee shall notprove false; and I assure thee, on the authority of the sage Mentironiana,that thy wages shall be paid thee, as thou shalt see in due season. Followthen the footsteps of the valiant enchanted knight, for it is expedientthat thou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of you; and asit is not permitted to me to say more, God be with thee; for I return tothat place I wot of;&rdquo; and as he brought the prophecy to a close he raisedhis voice to a high pitch, and then lowered it to such a soft tone, thateven those who knew it was all a joke were almost inclined to take whatthey heard seriously.</p><p>Don Quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard, for he at oncecomprehended its meaning perfectly, and perceived it was promised to himthat he should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with hisbeloved Dulcinea del Toboso, from whose blessed womb should proceed thewhelps, his sons, to the eternal glory of La Mancha; and being thoroughlyand firmly persuaded of this, he lifted up his voice, and with a deep sighexclaimed, &ldquo;Oh thou, whoever thou art, who hast foretold me so much good,I implore of thee that on my part thou entreat that sage enchanter whotakes charge of my interests, that he leave me not to perish in thiscaptivity in which they are now carrying me away, ere I see fulfilledpromises so joyful and incomparable as those which have been now made me;for, let this but come to pass, and I shall glory in the pains of myprison, find comfort in these chains wherewith they bind me, and regardthis bed whereon they stretch me, not as a hard battle-field, but as asoft and happy nuptial couch; and touching the consolation of SanchoPanza, my squire, I rely upon his goodness and rectitude that he will notdesert me in good or evil fortune; for if, by his ill luck or mine, it maynot happen to be in my power to give him the island I have promised, orany equivalent for it, at least his wages shall not be lost; for in mywill, which is already made, I have declared the sum that shall be paid tohim, measured, not by his many faithful services, but by the means at mydisposal.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed both his hands, for,being tied together, he could not kiss one; and then the apparitionslifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox-cart.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c46e" id="c46e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c46e.jpg (56K)" src="images/c46e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c46e.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch47" id="ch47"></a>CHAPTER XLVII.<br/>OF THE STRANGE MANNER IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS CARRIED AWAYENCHANTED, TOGETHER WITH OTHER REMARKABLE INCIDENTS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c47a" id="c47a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c47a.jpg (181K)" src="images/c47a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c47a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>When Don Quixote saw himself caged and hoisted on the cart in this way, hesaid, &ldquo;Many grave histories of knights-errant have I read; but never yethave I read, seen, or heard of their carrying off enchanted knights-errantin this fashion, or at the slow pace that these lazy, sluggish animalspromise; for they always take them away through the air with marvellousswiftness, enveloped in a dark thick cloud, or on a chariot of fire, or itmay be on some hippogriff or other beast of the kind; but to carry me offlike this on an ox-cart!

But perhaps the chivalryand enchantments of our day take a different course from that of those indays gone by; and it may be, too, that as I am a new knight in the world,and the first to revive the already forgotten calling ofknight-adventurers, they may have newly invented other kinds ofenchantments and other modes of carrying off the enchanted.

And if thou wouldst prove it, touch them,and feel them, and thou wilt find they have only bodies of air, and noconsistency except in appearance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God, master,&rdquo; returned Sancho, &ldquo;I have touched them already; and thatdevil, that goes about there so busily, has firm flesh, and anotherproperty very different from what I have heard say devils have, for by allaccounts they all smell of brimstone and other bad smells; but this onesmells of amber half a league off.&rdquo; Sancho was here speaking of DonFernando, who, like a gentleman of his rank, was very likely perfumed asSancho said.</p><p>&ldquo;Marvel not at that, Sancho my friend,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;for let me tellthee devils are crafty; and even if they do carry odours about with them,they themselves have no smell, because they are spirits; or, if they haveany smell, they cannot smell of anything sweet, but of something foul andfetid; and the reason is that as they carry hell with them wherever theygo, and can get no ease whatever from their torments, and as a sweet smellis a thing that gives pleasure and enjoyment, it is impossible that theycan smell sweet; if, then, this devil thou speakest of seems to thee tosmell of amber, either thou art deceiving thyself, or he wants to deceivethee by making thee fancy he is not a devil.&rdquo;</p><p>Such was the conversation that passed between master and man; and DonFernando and Cardenio, apprehensive of Sancho&rsquo;s making a completediscovery of their scheme, towards which he had already gone some way,resolved to hasten their departure, and calling the landlord aside, theydirected him to saddle Rocinante and put the pack-saddle on Sancho&rsquo;s ass,which he did with great alacrity. In the meantime the curate had made anarrangement with the officers that they should bear them company as far ashis village, he paying them so much a day. Cardenio hung the buckler onone side of the bow of Rocinante&rsquo;s saddle and the basin on the other, andby signs commanded Sancho to mount his ass and take Rocinante&rsquo;s bridle,and at each side of the cart he placed two officers with their muskets;but before the cart was put in motion, out came the landlady and herdaughter and Maritornes to bid Don Quixote farewell, pretending to weepwith grief at his misfortune; and to them Don Quixote said:</p><p>&ldquo;Weep not, good ladies, for all these mishaps are the lot of those whofollow the profession I profess; and if these reverses did not befall me Ishould not esteem myself a famous knight-errant; for such things neverhappen to knights of little renown and fame, because nobody in the worldthinks about them; to valiant knights they do, for these are envied fortheir virtue and valour by many princes and other knights who compass thedestruction of the worthy by base means. Nevertheless, virtue is ofherself so mighty, that, in spite of all the magic that Zoroaster itsfirst inventor knew, she will come victorious out of every trial, and shedher light upon the earth as the sun does upon the heavens. Forgive me,fair ladies, if, through inadvertence, I have in aught offended you; forintentionally and wittingly I have never done so to any; and pray to Godthat he deliver me from this captivity to which some malevolent enchanterhas consigned me; and should I find myself released therefrom, the favoursthat ye have bestowed upon me in this castle shall be held in memory byme, that I may acknowledge, recognise, and requite them as they deserve.&rdquo;</p><p>While this was passing between the ladies of the castle and Don Quixote,the curate and the barber bade farewell to Don Fernando and hiscompanions, to the captain, his brother, and the ladies, now all madehappy, and in particular to Dorothea and Luscinda. They all embraced oneanother, and promised to let each other know how things went with them,and Don Fernando directed the curate where to write to him, to tell himwhat became of Don Quixote, assuring him that there was nothing that couldgive him more pleasure than to hear of it, and that he too, on his part,would send him word of everything he thought he would like to know, abouthis marriage, Zoraida&rsquo;s baptism, Don Luis&rsquo;s affair, and Luscinda&rsquo;s returnto her home. The curate promised to comply with his request carefully, andthey embraced once more, and renewed their promises.</p><p>The landlord approached the curate and handed him some papers, saying hehad discovered them in the lining of the valise in which the novel of &ldquo;TheIll-advised Curiosity&rdquo; had been found, and that he might take them allaway with him as their owner had not since returned; for, as he could notread, he did not want them himself. The curate thanked him, and openingthem he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the words, &ldquo;Novel ofRinconete and Cortadillo,&rdquo; by which he perceived that it was a novel, andas that of &ldquo;The Ill-advised Curiosity&rdquo; had been good he concluded thiswould be so too, as they were both probably by the same author; so he keptit, intending to read it when he had an opportunity. He then mounted andhis friend the barber did the same, both masked, so as not to berecognised by Don Quixote, and set out following in the rear of the cart.The order of march was this: first went the cart with the owner leadingit; at each side of it marched the officers of the Brotherhood, as hasbeen said, with their muskets; then followed Sancho Panza on his ass,leading Rocinante by the bridle; and behind all came the curate and thebarber on their mighty mules, with faces covered, as aforesaid, and agrave and serious air, measuring their pace to suit the slow steps of theoxen. Don Quixote was seated in the cage, with his hands tied and his feetstretched out, leaning against the bars as silent and as patient as if hewere a stone statue and not a man of flesh. Thus slowly and silently theymade, it might be, two leagues, until they reached a valley which thecarter thought a convenient place for resting and feeding his oxen, and hesaid so to the curate, but the barber was of opinion that they ought topush on a little farther, as at the other side of a hill which appearedclose by he knew there was a valley that had more grass and much betterthan the one where they proposed to halt; and his advice was taken andthey continued their journey.</p><p>Just at that moment the curate, looking back, saw coming on behind themsix or seven mounted men, well found and equipped, who soon overtook them,for they were travelling, not at the sluggish, deliberate pace of oxen,but like men who rode canons&rsquo; mules, and in haste to take their noontiderest as soon as possible at the inn which was in sight not a league off.The quick travellers came up with the slow, and courteous salutations wereexchanged; and one of the new comers, who was, in fact, a canon of Toledoand master of the others who accompanied him, observing the regular orderof the procession, the cart, the officers, Sancho, Rocinante, the curateand the barber, and above all Don Quixote caged and confined, could nothelp asking what was the meaning of carrying the man in that fashion;though, from the badges of the officers, he already concluded that he mustbe some desperate highwayman or other malefactor whose punishment fellwithin the jurisdiction of the Holy Brotherhood. One of the officers towhom he had put the question, replied, &ldquo;Let the gentleman himself tell youthe meaning of his going this way, señor, for we do not know.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote overheard the conversation and said, &ldquo;Haply, gentlemen, youare versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry? Because if you are Iwill tell you my misfortunes; if not, there is no good in my giving myselfthe trouble of relating them;&rdquo; but here the curate and the barber, seeingthat the travellers were engaged in conversation with Don Quixote, cameforward, in order to answer in such a way as to save their stratagem frombeing discovered.</p><p>The canon, replying to Don Quixote, said, &ldquo;In truth, brother, I know moreabout books of chivalry than I do about Villalpando&rsquo;s elements of logic;so if that be all, you may safely tell me what you please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, then, señor,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;if that be so, I wouldhave you know that I am held enchanted in this cage by the envy and fraudof wicked enchanters; for virtue is more persecuted by the wicked thanloved by the good. I am a knight-errant, and not one of those whose namesFame has never thought of immortalising in her record, but of those who,in defiance and in spite of envy itself, and all the magicians thatPersia, or Brahmans that India, or Gymnosophists that Ethiopia everproduced, will place their names in the temple of immortality, to serve asexamples and patterns for ages to come, whereby knights-errant may see thefootsteps in which they must tread if they would attain the summit andcrowning point of honour in arms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha says,&rdquo; observed the curate, &ldquo;is thetruth; for he goes enchanted in this cart, not from any fault or sins ofhis, but because of the malevolence of those to whom virtue is odious andvalour hateful. This, señor, is the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, ifyou have ever heard him named, whose valiant achievements and mighty deedsshall be written on lasting brass and imperishable marble, notwithstandingall the efforts of envy to obscure them and malice to hide them.&rdquo;</p><p>When the canon heard both the prisoner and the man who was at liberty talkin such a strain he was ready to cross himself in his astonishment, andcould not make out what had befallen him; and all his attendants were inthe same state of amazement.</p><p>At this point Sancho Panza, who had drawn near to hear the conversation,said, in order to make everything plain, &ldquo;Well, sirs, you may like ordislike what I am going to say, but the fact of the matter is, my master,Don Quixote, is just as much enchanted as my mother. He is in his fullsenses, he eats and he drinks, and he has his calls like other men and ashe had yesterday, before they caged him. And if that&rsquo;s the case, what dothey mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted? For I have heardmany a one say that enchanted people neither eat, nor sleep, nor talk; andmy master, if you don&rsquo;t stop him, will talk more than thirty lawyers.&rdquo;Then turning to the curate he exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah, señor curate, señor curate!do you think I don&rsquo;t know you? Do you think I don&rsquo;t guess and see thedrift of these new enchantments? Well then, I can tell you I know you, forall your face is covered, and I can tell you I am up to you, however youmay hide your tricks. After all, where envy reigns virtue cannot live, andwhere there is niggardliness there can be no liberality. Ill betide thedevil! if it had not been for your worship my master would be married tothe Princess Micomicona this minute, and I should be a count at least; forno less was to be expected, as well from the goodness of my master, him ofthe Rueful Countenance, as from the greatness of my services. But I seenow how true it is what they say in these parts, that the wheel of fortuneturns faster than a mill-wheel, and that those who were up yesterday aredown to-day. I am sorry for my wife and children, for when they mightfairly and reasonably expect to see their father return to them a governoror viceroy of some island or kingdom, they will see him come back ahorse-boy. I have said all this, señor curate, only to urge your paternityto lay to your conscience your ill-treatment of my master; and have a carethat God does not call you to account in another life for making aprisoner of him in this way, and charge against you all the succours andgood deeds that my lord Don Quixote leaves undone while he is shut up.</p><p>&ldquo;Trim those lamps there!&rdquo; exclaimed the barber at this; &ldquo;so you are of thesame fraternity as your master, too, Sancho? By God, I begin to see thatyou will have to keep him company in the cage, and be enchanted like himfor having caught some of his humour and chivalry. It was an evil hourwhen you let yourself be got with child by his promises, and that islandyou long so much for found its way into your head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not with child by anyone,&rdquo; returned Sancho, &ldquo;nor am I a man to letmyself be got with child, if it was by the King himself. Though I am poorI am an old Christian, and I owe nothing to nobody, and if I long for anisland, other people long for worse. Each of us is the son of his ownworks; and being a man I may come to be pope, not to say governor of anisland, especially as my master may win so many that he will not know whomto give them to. Mind how you talk, master barber; for shaving is noteverything, and there is some difference between Peter and Peter. I saythis because we all know one another, and it will not do to throw falsedice with me; and as to the enchantment of my master, God knows the truth;leave it as it is; it only makes it worse to stir it.&rdquo;</p><p>The barber did not care to answer Sancho lest by his plain speaking heshould disclose what the curate and he himself were trying so hard toconceal; and under the same apprehension the curate had asked the canon toride on a little in advance, so that he might tell him the mystery of thisman in the cage, and other things that would amuse him. The canon agreed,and going on ahead with his servants, listened with attention to theaccount of the character, life, madness, and ways of Don Quixote, givenhim by the curate, who described to him briefly the beginning and originof his craze, and told him the whole story of his adventures up to hisbeing confined in the cage, together with the plan they had of taking himhome to try if by any means they could discover a cure for his madness.The canon and his servants were surprised anew when they heard DonQuixote&rsquo;s strange story, and when it was finished he said, &ldquo;To tell thetruth, señor curate, I for my part consider what they call books ofchivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though, led by idle and falsetaste, I have read the beginnings of almost all that have been printed, Inever could manage to read any one of them from beginning to end; for itseems to me they are all more or less the same thing; and one has nothingmore in it than another; this no more than that. And in my opinion thissort of writing and composition is of the same species as the fables theycall the Milesian, nonsensical tales that aim solely at giving amusementand not instruction, exactly the opposite of the apologue fables whichamuse and instruct at the same time. And though it may be the chief objectof such books to amuse, I do not know how they can succeed, when they areso full of such monstrous nonsense. For the enjoyment the mind feels mustcome from the beauty and harmony which it perceives or contemplates in thethings that the eye or the imagination brings before it; and nothing thathas any ugliness or disproportion about it can give any pleasure. Whatbeauty, then, or what proportion of the parts to the whole, or of thewhole to the parts, can there be in a book or fable where a lad of sixteencuts down a giant as tall as a tower and makes two halves of him as if hewas an almond cake? And when they want to give us a picture of a battle,after having told us that there are a million of combatants on the side ofthe enemy, let the hero of the book be opposed to them, and we haveperforce to believe, whether we like it or not, that the said knight winsthe victory by the single might of his strong arm. And then, what shall wesay of the facility with which a born queen or empress will give herselfover into the arms of some unknown wandering knight? What mind, that isnot wholly barbarous and uncultured, can find pleasure in reading of how agreat tower full of knights sails away across the sea like a ship with afair wind, and will be to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in theland of Prester John of the Indies, or some other that Ptolemy neverdescribed nor Marco Polo saw? And if, in answer to this, I am told thatthe authors of books of the kind write them as fiction, and therefore arenot bound to regard niceties of truth, I would reply that fiction is allthe better the more it looks like truth, and gives the more pleasure themore probability and possibility there is about it. Plots in fictionshould be wedded to the understanding of the reader, and be constructed insuch a way that, reconciling impossibilities, smoothing over difficulties,keeping the mind on the alert, they may surprise, interest, divert, andentertain, so that wonder and delight joined may keep pace one with theother; all which he will fail to effect who shuns verisimilitude and truthto nature, wherein lies the perfection of writing. I have never yet seenany book of chivalry that puts together a connected plot complete in allits numbers, so that the middle agrees with the beginning, and the endwith the beginning and middle; on the contrary, they construct them withsuch a multitude of members that it seems as though they meant to producea chimera or monster rather than a well-proportioned figure. And besidesall this they are harsh in their style, incredible in their achievements,licentious in their amours, uncouth in their courtly speeches, prolix intheir battles, silly in their arguments, absurd in their travels, and, inshort, wanting in everything like intelligent art; for which reason theydeserve to be banished from the Christian commonwealth as a worthlessbreed.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c47c" id="c47c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c47c.jpg (300K)" src="images/c47c.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c47c.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The curate listened to him attentively and felt that he was a man of soundunderstanding, and that there was good reason in what he said; so he toldhim that, being of the same opinion himself, and bearing a grudge to booksof chivalry, he had burned all Don Quixote&rsquo;s, which were many; and gavehim an account of the scrutiny he had made of them, and of those he hadcondemned to the flames and those he had spared, with which the canon wasnot a little amused, adding that though he had said so much incondemnation of these books, still he found one good thing in them, andthat was the opportunity they afforded to a gifted intellect fordisplaying itself; for they presented a wide and spacious field over whichthe pen might range freely, describing shipwrecks, tempests, combats,battles, portraying a valiant captain with all the qualificationsrequisite to make one, showing him sagacious in foreseeing the wiles ofthe enemy, eloquent in speech to encourage or restrain his soldiers, ripein counsel, rapid in resolve, as bold in biding his time as in pressingthe attack; now picturing some sad tragic incident, now some joyful andunexpected event; here a beauteous lady, virtuous, wise, and modest; therea Christian knight, brave and gentle; here a lawless, barbarous braggart;there a courteous prince, gallant and gracious; setting forth the devotionand loyalty of vassals, the greatness and generosity of nobles. &ldquo;Oragain,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the author may show himself to be an astronomer, or askilled cosmographer, or musician, or one versed in affairs of state, andsometimes he will have a chance of coming forward as a magician if helikes. He can set forth the craftiness of Ulysses, the piety of Æneas,the valour of Achilles, the misfortunes of Hector, the treachery of Sinon,the friendship of Euryalus, the generosity of Alexander, the boldness ofCæsar, the clemency and truth of Trajan, the fidelity of Zopyrus, thewisdom of Cato, and in short all the faculties that serve to make anillustrious man perfect, now uniting them in one individual, againdistributing them among many; and if this be done with charm of style andingenious invention, aiming at the truth as much as possible, he willassuredly weave a web of bright and varied threads that, when finished,will display such perfection and beauty that it will attain the worthiestobject any writing can seek, which, as I said before, is to giveinstruction and pleasure combined;

said the curate; &ldquo;and for that reasonthose who have hitherto written books of the sort deserve all the morecensure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or therules of art, by which they might guide themselves and become as famous inprose as the two princes of Greek and Latin poetry are in verse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I myself, at any rate,&rdquo; said the canon, &ldquo;was once tempted to write a bookof chivalry in which all the points I have mentioned were to be observed;and if I must own the truth I have more than a hundred sheets written; andto try if it came up to my own opinion of it, I showed them to persons whowere fond of this kind of reading, to learned and intelligent men as wellas to ignorant people who cared for nothing but the pleasure of listeningto nonsense, and from all I obtained flattering approval; nevertheless Iproceeded no farther with it, as well because it seemed to me anoccupation inconsistent with my profession, as because I perceived thatthe fools are more numerous than the wise; and, though it is better to bepraised by the wise few than applauded by the foolish many, I have no mindto submit myself to the stupid judgment of the silly public, to whom thereading of such books falls for the most part.</p><p>&ldquo;But what most of all made me hold my hand and even abandon all idea offinishing it was an argument I put to myself taken from the plays that areacted now-a-days, which was in this wise: if those that are now in vogue,as well those that are pure invention as those founded on history, are,all or most of them, downright nonsense and things that have neither headnor tail, and yet the public listens to them with delight, and regards andcries them up as perfection when they are so far from it; and if theauthors who write them, and the players who act them, say that this iswhat they must be, for the public wants this and will have nothing else;and that those that go by rule and work out a plot according to the lawsof art will only find some half-dozen intelligent people to understandthem, while all the rest remain blind to the merit of their composition;and that for themselves it is better to get bread from the many thanpraise from the few; then my book will fare the same way, after I haveburnt off my eyebrows in trying to observe the principles I have spokenof, and I shall be &lsquo;the tailor of the corner.&rsquo; And though I have sometimesendeavoured to convince actors that they are mistaken in this notion theyhave adopted, and that they would attract more people, and get morecredit, by producing plays in accordance with the rules of art, than byabsurd ones, they are so thoroughly wedded to their own opinion that noargument or evidence can wean them from it.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember saying one day to one of these obstinate fellows, &lsquo;Tell me, doyou not recollect that a few years ago, there were three tragedies actedin Spain, written by a famous poet of these kingdoms, which were such thatthey filled all who heard them with admiration, delight, and interest, theignorant as well as the wise, the masses as well as the higher orders, andbrought in more money to the performers, these three alone, than thirty ofthe best that have been since produced?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No doubt,&rsquo; replied the actor in question, &lsquo;you mean the &ldquo;Isabella,&rdquo; the&ldquo;Phyllis,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Alexandra.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Those are the ones I mean,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;and see if they did not observe theprinciples of art, and if, by observing them, they failed to show theirsuperiority and please all the world; so that the fault does not lie withthe public that insists upon nonsense, but with those who don&rsquo;t know howto produce something else. &ldquo;The Ingratitude Revenged&rdquo; was not nonsense,nor was there any in &ldquo;The Numantia,&rdquo; nor any to be found in &ldquo;The MerchantLover,&rdquo; nor yet in &ldquo;The Friendly Fair Foe,&rdquo; nor in some others that havebeen written by certain gifted poets, to their own fame and renown, and tothe profit of those that brought them out;&rsquo; some further remarks I addedto these, with which, I think, I left him rather dumbfoundered, but not sosatisfied or convinced that I could disabuse him of his error.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have touched upon a subject, señor canon,&rdquo; observed the curate here,&ldquo;that has awakened an old enmity I have against the plays in vogue at thepresent day, quite as strong as that which I bear to the books ofchivalry; for while the drama, according to Tully, should be the mirror ofhuman life, the model of manners, and the image of the truth, those whichare presented now-a-days are mirrors of nonsense, models of folly, andimages of lewdness. For what greater nonsense can there be in connectionwith what we are now discussing than for an infant to appear in swaddlingclothes in the first scene of the first act, and in the second a grown-upbearded man? Or what greater absurdity can there be than putting before usan old man as a swashbuckler, a young man as a poltroon, a lackey usingfine language, a page giving sage advice, a king plying as a porter, aprincess who is a kitchen-maid? And then what shall I say of theirattention to the time in which the action they represent may or can takeplace, save that I have seen a play where the first act began in Europe,the second in Asia, the third finished in Africa, and no doubt, had itbeen in four acts, the fourth would have ended in America, and so it wouldhave been laid in all four quarters of the globe? And if truth to life isthe main thing the drama should keep in view, how is it possible for anyaverage understanding to be satisfied when the action is supposed to passin the time of King Pepin or Charlemagne, and the principal personage init they represent to be the Emperor Heraclius who entered Jerusalem withthe cross and won the Holy Sepulchre, like Godfrey of Bouillon, therebeing years innumerable between the one and the other? or, if the play isbased on fiction and historical facts are introduced, or bits of whatoccurred to different people and at different times mixed up with it, all,not only without any semblance of probability, but with obvious errorsthat from every point of view are inexcusable? And the worst of it is,there are ignorant people who say that this is perfection, and thatanything beyond this is affected refinement. And then if we turn to sacreddramas&mdash;what miracles they invent in them! What apocryphal, ill-devisedincidents, attributing to one saint the miracles of another! And even insecular plays they venture to introduce miracles without any reason orobject except that they think some such miracle, or transformation as theycall it, will come in well to astonish stupid people and draw them to theplay. All this tends to the prejudice of the truth and the corruption ofhistory, nay more, to the reproach of the wits of Spain; for foreignerswho scrupulously observe the laws of the drama look upon us as barbarousand ignorant, when they see the absurdity and nonsense of the plays weproduce. Nor will it be a sufficient excuse to say that the chief objectwell-ordered governments have in view when they permit plays to beperformed in public is to entertain the people with some harmlessamusement occasionally, and keep it from those evil humours which idlenessis apt to engender; and that, as this may be attained by any sort of play,good or bad, there is no need to lay down laws, or bind those who write oract them to make them as they ought to be made, since, as I say, theobject sought for may be secured by any sort. To this I would reply thatthe same end would be, beyond all comparison, better attained by means ofgood plays than by those that are not so; for after listening to anartistic and properly constructed play, the hearer will come awayenlivened by the jests, instructed by the serious parts, full ofadmiration at the incidents, his wits sharpened by the arguments, warnedby the tricks, all the wiser for the examples, inflamed against vice, andin love with virtue; for in all these ways a good play will stimulate themind of the hearer be he ever so boorish or dull; and of allimpossibilities the greatest is that a play endowed with all thesequalities will not entertain, satisfy, and please much more than onewanting in them, like the greater number of those which are commonly actednow-a-days. Nor are the poets who write them to be blamed for this; forsome there are among them who are perfectly well aware of their faults,and know what they ought to do; but as plays have become a salablecommodity, they say, and with truth, that the actors will not buy themunless they are after this fashion; and so the poet tries to adapt himselfto the requirements of the actor who is to pay him for his work. And thatthis is the truth may be seen by the countless plays that a most fertilewit of these kingdoms has written, with so much brilliancy, so much graceand gaiety, such polished versification, such choice language, suchprofound reflections, and in a word, so rich in eloquence and elevation ofstyle, that he has filled the world with his fame; and yet, in consequenceof his desire to suit the taste of the actors, they have not all, as someof them have, come as near perfection as they ought. Others write playswith such heedlessness that, after they have been acted, the actors haveto fly and abscond, afraid of being punished, as they often have been, forhaving acted something offensive to some king or other, or insulting tosome noble family. All which evils, and many more that I say nothing of,would be removed if there were some intelligent and sensible person at thecapital to examine all plays before they were acted, not only thoseproduced in the capital itself, but all that were intended to be acted inSpain; without whose approval, seal, and signature, no local magistracyshould allow any play to be acted. In that case actors would take care tosend their plays to the capital, and could act them in safety, and thosewho write them would be more careful and take more pains with their work,standing in awe of having to submit it to the strict examination of onewho understood the matter; and so good plays would be produced and theobjects they aim at happily attained; as well the amusement of the people,as the credit of the wits of Spain, the interest and safety of the actors,and the saving of trouble in inflicting punishment on them. And if thesame or some other person were authorised to examine the newly writtenbooks of chivalry, no doubt some would appear with all the perfections youhave described, enriching our language with the gracious and precioustreasure of eloquence, and driving the old books into obscurity before thelight of the new ones that would come out for the harmless entertainment,not merely of the idle but of the very busiest; for the bow cannot bealways bent, nor can weak human nature exist without some lawfulamusement.&rdquo;</p><p>The canon and the curate had proceeded thus far with their conversation,when the barber, coming forward, joined them, and said to the curate,&ldquo;This is the spot, señor licentiate, that I said was a good one for freshand plentiful pasture for the oxen, while we take our noontide rest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And so it seems,&rdquo; returned the curate, and he told the canon what heproposed to do, on which he too made up his mind to halt with them,attracted by the aspect of the fair valley that lay before their eyes; andto enjoy it as well as the conversation of the curate, to whom he hadbegun to take a fancy, and also to learn more particulars about the doingsof Don Quixote, he desired some of his servants to go on to the inn, whichwas not far distant, and fetch from it what eatables there might be forthe whole party, as he meant to rest for the afternoon where he was; towhich one of his servants replied that the sumpter mule, which by thistime ought to have reached the inn, carried provisions enough to make itunnecessary to get anything from the inn except barley.</p><p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said the canon, &ldquo;take all the beasts there, and bring thesumpter mule back.&rdquo;</p><p>While this was going on, Sancho, perceiving that he could speak to hismaster without having the curate and the barber, of whom he had hissuspicions, present all the time, approached the cage in which Don Quixotewas placed, and said, &ldquo;Señor, to ease my conscience I want to tell you thestate of the case as to your enchantment, and that is that these two here,with their faces covered, are the curate of our village and the barber;and I suspect they have hit upon this plan of carrying you off in thisfashion, out of pure envy because your worship surpasses them in doingfamous deeds; and if this be the truth it follows that you are notenchanted, but hoodwinked and made a fool of. And to prove this I want toask you one thing; and if you answer me as I believe you will answer, youwill be able to lay your finger on the trick, and you will see that youare not enchanted but gone wrong in your wits.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ask what thou wilt, Sancho my son,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;for I willsatisfy thee and answer all thou requirest. As to what thou sayest, thatthese who accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber, ourneighbours and acquaintances, it is very possible that they may seem to bethose same persons; but that they are so in reality and in fact, believeit not on any account; what thou art to believe and think is that, if theylook like them, as thou sayest, it must be that those who have enchantedme have taken this shape and likeness; for it is easy for enchanters totake any form they please, and they may have taken those of our friends inorder to make thee think as thou dost, and lead thee into a labyrinth offancies from which thou wilt find no escape though thou hadst the cord ofTheseus; and they may also have done it to make me uncertain in my mind,and unable to conjecture whence this evil comes to me; for if on the onehand thou dost tell me that the barber and curate of our village are herein company with us, and on the other I find myself shut up in a cage, andknow in my heart that no power on earth that was not supernatural wouldhave been able to shut me in, what wouldst thou have me say or think, butthat my enchantment is of a sort that transcends all I have ever read ofin all the histories that deal with knights-errant that have beenenchanted? So thou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that theyare what thou sayest, for they are as much so as I am a Turk. But touchingthy desire to ask me something, say on, and I will answer thee, thoughthou shouldst ask questions from this till to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May Our Lady be good to me!&rdquo; said Sancho, lifting up his voice;&ldquo;and is it possible that your worship is so thick of skull and so shortof brains that you cannot see that what I say is the simple truth, and thatmalice has more to do with your imprisonment and misfortune than enchantment?But as it is so, I will prove plainly to you that you are not enchanted. Nowtell me, so may God deliver you from this affliction, and so may you findyourself when you least expect it in the arms of my lady Dulcinea&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave off conjuring me,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and ask what thou wouldstknow; I have already told thee I will answer with all possible precision.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is what I want,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;and what I would know,and have you tell me, without adding or leaving out anything, but telling thewhole truth as one expects it to be told, and as it is told, by all who professarms, as your worship professes them, under the title ofknights-errant&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I tell thee I will not lie in any particular,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;finishthy question; for in truth thou weariest me with all these asseverations,requirements, and precautions, Sancho.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I rely on the goodness and truth of my master,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;andso, because it bears upon what we are talking about, I would ask, speakingwith all reverence, whether since your worship has been shut up and, asyou think, enchanted in this cage, you have felt any desire or inclinationto go anywhere, as the saying is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not understand &lsquo;going anywhere,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;explain thyselfmore clearly, Sancho, if thou wouldst have me give an answer to thepoint.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that your worship does not understand&lsquo;going anywhere&rsquo;? Why, the schoolboys know that from the time they werebabes. Well then, you must know I mean have you had any desire to do whatcannot be avoided?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! now I understand thee, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;yes, often, andeven this minute; get me out of this strait, or all will not go right.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c48e" id="c48e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c48e.jpg (32K)" src="images/c48e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch49" id="ch49"></a>CHAPTER XLIX.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF THE SHREWD CONVERSATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HISMASTER DON QUIXOTE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c49a" id="c49a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c49a.jpg (181K)" src="images/c49a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c49a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Aha, I have caught you,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;this is what in my heart and soulI was longing to know. Come now, señor, can you deny what is commonly saidaround us, when a person is out of humour, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what ailsso-and-so, that he neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor gives aproper answer to any question; one would think he was enchanted&rsquo;? Fromwhich it is to be gathered that those who do not eat, or drink, or sleep,or do any of the natural acts I am speaking of&mdash;that such persons areenchanted; but not those that have the desire your worship has, and drinkwhen drink is given them, and eat when there is anything to eat, andanswer every question that is asked them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What thou sayest is true, Sancho,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;but I havealready told thee there are many sorts of enchantments, and it may be thatin the course of time they have been changed one for another, and that nowit may be the way with enchanted people to do all that I do, though theydid not do so before; so it is vain to argue or draw inferences againstthe usage of the time. I know and feel that I am enchanted, and that isenough to ease my conscience; for it would weigh heavily on it if Ithought that I was not enchanted, and that in a faint-hearted and cowardlyway I allowed myself to lie in this cage, defrauding multitudes of thesuccour I might afford to those in need and distress, who at this verymoment may be in sore want of my aid and protection.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still for all that,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;I say that, for your greater andfuller satisfaction, it would be well if your worship were to try to getout of this prison (and I promise to do all in my power to help, and evento take you out of it), and see if you could once more mount your goodRocinante, who seems to be enchanted too, he is so melancholy anddejected; and then we might try our chance in looking for adventuresagain; and if we have no luck there will be time enough to go back to thecage; in which, on the faith of a good and loyal squire, I promise to shutmyself up along with your worship, if so be you are so unfortunate, or Iso stupid, as not to be able to carry out my plan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am content to do as thou sayest, brother Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;and when thou seest an opportunity for effecting my release I will obeythee absolutely; but thou wilt see, Sancho, how mistaken thou art in thyconception of my misfortune.&rdquo;</p><p>The knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversationtill they reached the place where the curate, the canon, and the barber,who had already dismounted, were waiting for them. The carter at onceunyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant greenspot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, not enchanted people likeDon Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like his squire, who begged thecurate to allow his master to leave the cage for a little; for if they didnot let him out, the prison might not be as clean as the propriety of sucha gentleman as his master required. The curate understood him, and said hewould very gladly comply with his request, only that he feared his master,finding himself at liberty, would take to his old courses and make offwhere nobody could ever find him again.</p><p>&ldquo;I will answer for his not running away,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;And I also,&rdquo; said the canon, &ldquo;especially if he gives me his word as aknight not to leave us without our consent.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote, who was listening to all this, said, &ldquo;I giveit;&mdash;moreover one who is enchanted as I am cannot do as he likes withhimself; for he who had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one placefor three ages, and if he attempted to escape would bring him backflying.&rdquo;&mdash;And that being so, they might as well release him,particularly as it would be to the advantage of all; for, if they did not lethim out, he protested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrilsunless they kept their distance.</p><p>The canon took his hand, tied together as they both were, and on his wordand promise they unbound him, and rejoiced beyond measure he was to findhimself out of the cage. The first thing he did was to stretch himself allover, and then he went to where Rocinante was standing and giving him acouple of slaps on the haunches said, &ldquo;I still trust in God and in hisblessed mother, O flower and mirror of steeds, that we shall soon seeourselves, both of us, as we wish to be, thou with thy master on thy back,and I mounted upon thee, following the calling for which God sent me intothe world.&rdquo; And so saying, accompanied by Sancho, he withdrew to a retiredspot, from which he came back much relieved and more eager than ever toput his squire&rsquo;s scheme into execution.</p><p>The canon gazed at him, wondering at the extraordinary nature of hismadness, and that in all his remarks and replies he should show suchexcellent sense, and only lose his stirrups, as has been already said,when the subject of chivalry was broached. And so, moved by compassion, hesaid to him, as they all sat on the green grass awaiting the arrival ofthe provisions:</p><p>&ldquo;Is it possible, gentle sir, that the nauseous and idle reading of booksof chivalry can have had such an effect on your worship as to upset yourreason so that you fancy yourself enchanted, and the like, all as far fromthe truth as falsehood itself is? How can there be any human understandingthat can persuade itself there ever was all that infinity of Amadises inthe world, or all that multitude of famous knights, all those emperors ofTrebizond, all those Felixmartes of Hircania, all those palfreys, anddamsels-errant, and serpents, and monsters, and giants, and marvellousadventures, and enchantments of every kind, and battles, and prodigiousencounters, splendid costumes, love-sick princesses, squires made counts,droll dwarfs, love letters, billings and cooings, swashbuckler women, and,in a word, all that nonsense the books of chivalry contain? For myself, Ican only say that when I read them, so long as I do not stop to think thatthey are all lies and frivolity, they give me a certain amount ofpleasure; but when I come to consider what they are, I fling the very bestof them at the wall, and would fling it into the fire if there were one athand, as richly deserving such punishment as cheats and impostors out ofthe range of ordinary toleration, and as founders of new sects and modesof life, and teachers that lead the ignorant public to believe and acceptas truth all the folly they contain. And such is their audacity, they evendare to unsettle the wits of gentlemen of birth and intelligence, as isshown plainly by the way they have served your worship, when they havebrought you to such a pass that you have to be shut up in a cage andcarried on an ox-cart as one would carry a lion or a tiger from place toplace to make money by showing it. Come, Señor Don Quixote, have somecompassion for yourself, return to the bosom of common sense, and make useof the liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to bestow uponyou, employing your abundant gifts of mind in some other reading that mayserve to benefit your conscience and add to your honour. And if, still ledaway by your natural bent, you desire to read books of achievements and ofchivalry, read the Book of Judges in the Holy Scriptures, for there youwill find grand reality, and deeds as true as they are heroic. Lusitaniahad a Viriatus, Rome a Cæsar, Carthage a Hannibal, Greece an Alexander,Castile a Count Fernan Gonzalez, Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a GonzaloFernandez, Estremadura a Diego García de Paredes, Jerez a Garci Perez deVargas, Toledo a Garcilaso, Seville a Don Manuel de Leon, to read of whosevaliant deeds will entertain and instruct the loftiest minds and fill themwith delight and wonder. Here, Señor Don Quixote, will be reading worthyof your sound understanding; from which you will rise learned in history,in love with virtue, strengthened in goodness, improved in manners, bravewithout rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to the honour of God,your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, I am informed, yourworship derives your birth.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote listened with the greatest attention to the canon&rsquo;s words, andwhen he found he had finished, after regarding him for some time, hereplied to him:</p><p>&ldquo;It appears to me, gentle sir, that your worship&rsquo;s discourse is intendedto persuade me that there never were any knights-errant in the world, andthat all the books of chivalry are false, lying, mischievous and uselessto the State, and that I have done wrong in reading them, and worse inbelieving them, and still worse in imitating them, when I undertook tofollow the arduous calling of knight-errantry which they set forth; foryou deny that there ever were Amadises of Gaul or of Greece, or any otherof the knights of whom the books are full.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is all exactly as you state it,&rdquo; said the canon; to which Don Quixotereturned, &ldquo;You also went on to say that books of this kind had done memuch harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me up in a cage,and that it would be better for me to reform and change my studies, andread other truer books which would afford more pleasure and instruction.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said the canon.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;to my mind it is you who are the onethat is out of his wits and enchanted, as you have ventured to utter suchblasphemies against a thing so universally acknowledged and accepted astrue that whoever denies it, as you do, deserves the same punishment whichyou say you inflict on the books that irritate you when you read them. Forto try to persuade anybody that Amadis, and all the otherknights-adventurers with whom the books are filled, never existed, wouldbe like trying to persuade him that the sun does not yield light, or icecold, or earth nourishment. What wit in the world can persuade anotherthat the story of the Princess Floripes and Guy of Burgundy is not true,or that of Fierabras and the bridge of Mantible, which happened in thetime of Charlemagne? For by all that is good it is as true as that it isdaylight now; and if it be a lie, it must be a lie too that there was aHector, or Achilles, or Trojan war, or Twelve Peers of France, or Arthurof England, who still lives changed into a raven, and is unceasinglylooked for in his kingdom. One might just as well try to make out that thehistory of Guarino Mezquino, or of the quest of the Holy Grail, is false,or that the loves of Tristram and the Queen Yseult are apocryphal, as wellas those of Guinevere and Lancelot, when there are persons who can almostremember having seen the Dame Quintañona, who was the best cupbearer inGreat Britain. And so true is this, that I recollect a grandmother of mineon the father&rsquo;s side, whenever she saw any dame in a venerable hood, usedto say to me, &lsquo;Grandson, that one is like Dame Quintañona,&rsquo; from which Iconclude that she must have known her, or at least had managed to see someportrait of her. Then who can deny that the story of Pierres and the fairMagalona is true, when even to this day may be seen in the king&rsquo;s armourythe pin with which the valiant Pierres guided the wooden horse he rodethrough the air, and it is a trifle bigger than the pole of a cart? Andalongside of the pin is Babieca&rsquo;s saddle, and at Roncesvalles there isRoland&rsquo;s horn, as large as a large beam; whence we may infer that therewere Twelve Peers, and a Pierres, and a Cid, and other knights like them,of the sort people commonly call adventurers. Or perhaps I shall be told,too, that there was no such knight-errant as the valiant Lusitanian Juande Merlo, who went to Burgundy and in the city of Arras fought with thefamous lord of Charny, Mosen Pierres by name, and afterwards in the cityof Basle with Mosen Enrique de Remesten, coming out of both encounterscovered with fame and honour; or adventures and challenges achieved anddelivered, also in Burgundy, by the valiant Spaniards Pedro Barba andGutierre Quixada (of whose family I come in the direct male line), whenthey vanquished the sons of the Count of San Polo. I shall be told, too,that Don Fernando de Guevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germany,where he engaged in combat with Micer George, a knight of the house of theDuke of Austria. I shall be told that the jousts of Suero de Quiñones, himof the &lsquo;Paso,&rsquo; and the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against theCastilian knight, Don Gonzalo de Guzman, were mere mockeries; as well asmany other achievements of Christian knights of these and foreign realms,which are so authentic and true, that, I repeat, he who denies them mustbe totally wanting in reason and good sense.&rdquo;</p><p>The canon was amazed to hear the medley of truth and fiction Don Quixoteuttered, and to see how well acquainted he was with everything relating orbelonging to the achievements of his knight-errantry; so he said in reply:</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot deny, Señor Don Quixote, that there is some truth in what yousay, especially as regards the Spanish knights-errant; and I am willing togrant too that the Twelve Peers of France existed, but I am not disposedto believe that they did all the things that the Archbishop Turpin relatesof them. For the truth of the matter is they were knights chosen by thekings of France, and called &lsquo;Peers&rsquo; because they were all equal in worth,rank and prowess (at least if they were not they ought to have been), andit was a kind of religious order like those of Santiago and Calatrava inthe present day, in which it is assumed that those who take it are valiantknights of distinction and good birth; and just as we say now a Knight ofSt. John, or of Alcántara, they used to say then a Knight of the TwelvePeers, because twelve equals were chosen for that military order. Thatthere was a Cid, as well as a Bernardo del Carpio, there can be no doubt;but that they did the deeds people say they did, I hold to be verydoubtful. In that other matter of the pin of Count Pierres that you speakof, and say is near Babieca&rsquo;s saddle in the Armoury, I confess my sin; forI am either so stupid or so short-sighted, that, though I have seen thesaddle, I have never been able to see the pin, in spite of it being as bigas your worship says it is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that it is there, without any manner of doubt,&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;and more by token they say it is inclosed in a sheath of cowhide to keepit from rusting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that may be,&rdquo; replied the canon; &ldquo;but, by the orders I have received,I do not remember seeing it. However, granting it is there, that is noreason why I am bound to believe the stories of all those Amadises and ofall that multitude of knights they tell us about, nor is it reasonablethat a man like your worship, so worthy, and with so many good qualities,and endowed with such a good understanding, should allow himself to bepersuaded that such wild crazy things as are written in those absurd booksof chivalry are really true.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c49e" id="c49e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c49e.jpg (22K)" src="images/c49e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch50" id="ch50"></a>CHAPTER L.<br/>OF THE SHREWD CONTROVERSY WHICH DON QUIXOTE AND THE CANON HELD, TOGETHERWITH OTHER INCIDENTS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c50a" id="c50a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c50a.jpg (160K)" src="images/c50a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c50a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;A good joke, that!&rdquo; returned Don Quixote. &ldquo;Books that have been printedwith the king&rsquo;s licence, and with the approbation of those to whom theyhave been submitted, and read with universal delight, and extolled bygreat and small, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, gentle and simple,in a word by people of every sort, of whatever rank or condition they maybe&mdash;that these should be lies!

And afterhaving seen all this, what can be more charming than to see how a bevy ofdamsels comes forth from the gate of the castle in gay and gorgeousattire, such that, were I to set myself now to depict it as the historiesdescribe it to us, I should never have done; and then how she who seems tobe the first among them all takes the bold knight who plunged into theboiling lake by the hand, and without addressing a word to him leads himinto the rich palace or castle, and strips him as naked as when his motherbore him, and bathes him in lukewarm water, and anoints him all over withsweet-smelling unguents, and clothes him in a shirt of the softest sendal,all scented and perfumed, while another damsel comes and throws over hisshoulders a mantle which is said to be worth at the very least a city, andeven more?

For myself I can say that since I havebeen a knight-errant I have become valiant, polite, generous, well-bred,magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have learned tobear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and though it be such ashort time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like a madman, Ihope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune thwart me not,to see myself king of some kingdom where I may be able to show thegratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by my faith, señor,the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of generosity toanyone, though he may possess it in the highest degree; and gratitude thatconsists of disposition only is a dead thing, just as faith without worksis dead. For this reason I should be glad were fortune soon to offer mesome opportunity of making myself an emperor, so as to show my heart indoing good to my friends, particularly to this poor Sancho Panza, mysquire, who is the best fellow in the world; and I would gladly give him acounty I have promised him this ever so long, only that I am afraid he hasnot the capacity to govern his realm.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho partly heard these last words of his master, and said to him,&ldquo;Strive hard you, Señor Don Quixote, to give me that county so oftenpromised by you and so long looked for by me, for I promise you there willbe no want of capacity in me to govern it; and even if there is, I haveheard say there are men in the world who farm seigniories, paying so mucha year, and they themselves taking charge of the government, while thelord, with his legs stretched out, enjoys the revenue they pay him,without troubling himself about anything else. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do, andnot stand haggling over trifles, but wash my hands at once of the wholebusiness, and enjoy my rents like a duke, and let things go their ownway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That, brother Sancho,&rdquo; said the canon, &ldquo;only holds good as far as theenjoyment of the revenue goes; but the lord of the seigniory must attendto the administration of justice, and here capacity and sound judgmentcome in, and above all a firm determination to find out the truth; for ifthis be wanting in the beginning, the middle and the end will always gowrong; and God as commonly aids the honest intentions of the simple as hefrustrates the evil designs of the crafty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand those philosophies,&rdquo; returned Sancho Panza; &ldquo;all Iknow is I would I had the county as soon as I shall know how to govern it;for I have as much soul as another, and as much body as anyone, and Ishall be as much king of my realm as any other of his; and being so Ishould do as I liked, and doing as I liked I should please myself, andpleasing myself I should be content, and when one is content he hasnothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire there isan end of it; so let the county come, and God be with you, and let us seeone another, as one blind man said to the other.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is not bad philosophy thou art talking, Sancho,&rdquo; said the canon;&ldquo;but for all that there is a good deal to be said on this matter ofcounties.&rdquo;</p><p>To which Don Quixote returned, &ldquo;I know not what more there is to be said;I only guide myself by the example set me by the great Amadis of Gaul,when he made his squire count of the Insula Firme; and so, without anyscruples of conscience, I can make a count of Sancho Panza, for he is oneof the best squires that ever knight-errant had.&rdquo;</p><p>The canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense becapable of method) that Don Quixote uttered, at the way in which he haddescribed the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impression thatthe deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, and lastly hemarvelled at the simplicity of Sancho, who desired so eagerly to obtainthe county his master had promised him.</p><p>By this time the canon&rsquo;s servants, who had gone to the inn to fetch thesumpter mule, had returned, and making a carpet and the green grass of themeadow serve as a table, they seated themselves in the shade of some treesand made their repast there, that the carter might not be deprived of theadvantage of the spot, as has been already said. As they were eating theysuddenly heard a loud noise and the sound of a bell that seemed to comefrom among some brambles and thick bushes that were close by, and the sameinstant they observed a beautiful goat, spotted all over black, white, andbrown, spring out of the thicket with a goatherd after it, calling to itand uttering the usual cries to make it stop or turn back to the fold. Thefugitive goat, scared and frightened, ran towards the company as ifseeking their protection and then stood still, and the goatherd coming upseized it by the horns and began to talk to it as if it were possessed ofreason and understanding: &ldquo;Ah wanderer, wanderer, Spotty, Spotty; how haveyou gone limping all this time? What wolves have frightened you, mydaughter? Won&rsquo;t you tell me what is the matter, my beauty? But what elsecan it be except that you are a she, and cannot keep quiet? A plague onyour humours and the humours of those you take after! Come back, comeback, my darling; and if you will not be so happy, at any rate you will besafe in the fold or with your companions; for if you who ought to keep andlead them, go wandering astray, what will become of them?&rdquo;</p><p>The goatherd&rsquo;s talk amused all who heard it, but especially the canon, whosaid to him, &ldquo;As you live, brother, take it easy, and be not in such ahurry to drive this goat back to the fold; for, being a female, as yousay, she will follow her natural instinct in spite of all you can do toprevent it. Take this morsel and drink a sup, and that will soothe yourirritation, and in the meantime the goat will rest herself,&rdquo; and sosaying, he handed him the loins of a cold rabbit on a fork.</p><p>The goatherd took it with thanks, and drank and calmed himself, and thensaid, &ldquo;I should be sorry if your worships were to take me for a simpletonfor having spoken so seriously as I did to this animal; but the truth isthere is a certain mystery in the words I used. I am a clown, but not somuch of one but that I know how to behave to men and to beasts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I can well believe,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;for I know already byexperience that the woods breed men of learning, and shepherds&rsquo; huts harbourphilosophers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At all events, señor,&rdquo; returned the goatherd, &ldquo;they shelter men ofexperience; and that you may see the truth of this and grasp it, though Imay seem to put myself forward without being asked, I will, if it will nottire you, gentlemen, and you will give me your attention for a little,tell you a true story which will confirm this gentleman&rsquo;s word (and hepointed to the curate) as well as my own.&rdquo;</p><p>To this Don Quixote replied, &ldquo;Seeing that this affair has a certain colourof chivalry about it, I for my part, brother, will hear you most gladly,and so will all these gentlemen, from the high intelligence they possessand their love of curious novelties that interest, charm, and entertainthe mind, as I feel quite sure your story will do. So begin, friend, forwe are all prepared to listen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I draw my stakes,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and will retreat with this pasty to thebrook there, where I mean to victual myself for three days; for I haveheard my lord, Don Quixote, say that a knight-errant&rsquo;s squire should eatuntil he can hold no more, whenever he has the chance, because it oftenhappens them to get by accident into a wood so thick that they cannot finda way out of it for six days; and if the man is not well filled or hisalforjas well stored, there he may stay, as very often he does, turnedinto a dried mummy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art in the right of it, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;go where thouwilt and eat all thou canst, for I have had enough, and only want to givemy mind its refreshment, as I shall by listening to this good fellow&rsquo;sstory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is what we shall all do,&rdquo; said the canon; and then begged the goatherdto begin the promised tale.</p><p>The goatherd gave the goat which he held by the horns a couple of slaps onthe back, saying, &ldquo;Lie down here beside me, Spotty, for we have timeenough to return to our fold.&rdquo; The goat seemed to understand him, for asher master seated himself, she stretched herself quietly beside him andlooked up in his face to show him she was all attention to what he wasgoing to say, and then in these words he began his story.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c50e" id="c50e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c50e.jpg (27K)" src="images/c50e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch51" id="ch51"></a>CHAPTER LI.<br/>WHICH DEALS WITH WHAT THE GOATHERD TOLD THOSE WHO WERE CARRYING OFF DONQUIXOTE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c51a" id="c51a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c51a.jpg (115K)" src="images/c51a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c51a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Three leagues from this valley there is a village which, though small, isone of the richest in all this neighbourhood, and in it there lived afarmer, a very worthy man, and so much respected that, although to be sois the natural consequence of being rich, he was even more respected forhis virtue than for the wealth he had acquired. But what made him stillmore fortunate, as he said himself, was having a daughter of suchexceeding beauty, rare intelligence, gracefulness, and virtue, thateveryone who knew her and beheld her marvelled at the extraordinary giftswith which heaven and nature had endowed her. As a child she wasbeautiful, she continued to grow in beauty, and at the age of sixteen shewas most lovely. The fame of her beauty began to spread abroad through allthe villages around&mdash;but why do I say the villages around, merely,when it spread to distant cities, and even made its way into the halls ofroyalty and reached the ears of people of every class, who came from allsides to see her as if to see something rare and curious, or somewonder-working image?</p><p>Her father watched over her and she watched over herself; for there are nolocks, or guards, or bolts that can protect a young girl better than herown modesty. The wealth of the father and the beauty of the daughter ledmany neighbours as well as strangers to seek her for a wife; but he, asone might well be who had the disposal of so rich a jewel, was perplexedand unable to make up his mind to which of her countless suitors he shouldentrust her. I was one among the many who felt a desire so natural, and,as her father knew who I was, and I was of the same town, of pure blood,in the bloom of life, and very rich in possessions, I had great hopes ofsuccess. There was another of the same place and qualifications who alsosought her, and this made her father&rsquo;s choice hang in the balance, for hefelt that on either of us his daughter would be well bestowed; so toescape from this state of perplexity he resolved to refer the matter toLeandra (for that is the name of the rich damsel who has reduced me tomisery), reflecting that as we were both equal it would be best to leaveit to his dear daughter to choose according to her inclination&mdash;acourse that is worthy of imitation by all fathers who wish to settle theirchildren in life. I do not mean that they ought to leave them to make achoice of what is contemptible and bad, but that they should place beforethem what is good and then allow them to make a good choice as theyplease. I do not know which Leandra chose; I only know her father put usboth off with the tender age of his daughter and vague words that neitherbound him nor dismissed us. My rival is called Anselmo and I myselfEugenio&mdash;that you may know the names of the personages that figure inthis tragedy, the end of which is still in suspense, though it is plain tosee it must be disastrous.</p><p>About this time there arrived in our town one Vicente de la Roca, the sonof a poor peasant of the same town, the said Vicente having returned fromservice as a soldier in Italy and divers other parts. A captain whochanced to pass that way with his company had carried him off from ourvillage when he was a boy of about twelve years, and now twelve yearslater the young man came back in a soldier&rsquo;s uniform, arrayed in athousand colours, and all over glass trinkets and fine steel chains.To-day he would appear in one gay dress, to-morrow in another; but allflimsy and gaudy, of little substance and less worth. The peasant folk,who are naturally malicious, and when they have nothing to do can bemalice itself, remarked all this, and took note of his finery andjewellery, piece by piece, and discovered that he had three suits ofdifferent colours, with garters and stockings to match; but he made somany arrangements and combinations out of them, that if they had notcounted them, anyone would have sworn that he had made a display of morethan ten suits of clothes and twenty plumes. Do not look upon all thisthat I am telling you about the clothes as uncalled for or spun out, forthey have a great deal to do with the story. He used to seat himself on abench under the great poplar in our plaza, and there he would keep us allhanging open-mouthed on the stories he told us of his exploits. There wasno country on the face of the globe he had not seen, nor battle he had notbeen engaged in; he had killed more Moors than there are in Morocco andTunis, and fought more single combats, according to his own account, thanGarcilaso, Diego García de Paredes and a thousand others he named, and outof all he had come victorious without losing a drop of blood. On the otherhand he showed marks of wounds, which, though they could not be made out,he said were gunshot wounds received in divers encounters and actions.Lastly, with monstrous impudence he used to say &ldquo;you&rdquo; to his equals andeven those who knew what he was, and declare that his arm was his fatherand his deeds his pedigree, and that being a soldier he was as good as theking himself. And to add to these swaggering ways he was a trifle of amusician, and played the guitar with such a flourish that some said hemade it speak; nor did his accomplishments end here, for he was somethingof a poet too, and on every trifle that happened in the town he made aballad a league long.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c51b" id="c51b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c51b.jpg (372K)" src="images/c51b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c51b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>This soldier, then, that I have described, this Vicente de la Roca, thisbravo, gallant, musician, poet, was often seen and watched by Leandra froma window of her house which looked out on the plaza. The glitter of hisshowy attire took her fancy, his ballads bewitched her (for he gave awaytwenty copies of every one he made), the tales of his exploits which hetold about himself came to her ears; and in short, as the devil no doubthad arranged it, she fell in love with him before the presumption ofmaking love to her had suggested itself to him; and as in love-affairsnone are more easily brought to an issue than those which have theinclination of the lady for an ally, Leandra and Vicente came to anunderstanding without any difficulty; and before any of her numeroussuitors had any suspicion of her design, she had already carried it intoeffect, having left the house of her dearly beloved father (for mother shehad none), and disappeared from the village with the soldier, who camemore triumphantly out of this enterprise than out of any of the largenumber he laid claim to. All the village and all who heard of it wereamazed at the affair; I was aghast, Anselmo thunderstruck, her father fullof grief, her relations indignant, the authorities all in a ferment, theofficers of the Brotherhood in arms. They scoured the roads, they searchedthe woods and all quarters, and at the end of three days they found theflighty Leandra in a mountain cave, stript to her shift, and robbed of allthe money and precious jewels she had carried away from home with her.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c51c" id="c51c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c51c.jpg (275K)" src="images/c51c.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c51c.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>They brought her back to her unhappy father, and questioned her as to hermisfortune, and she confessed without pressure that Vicente de la Roca haddeceived her, and under promise of marrying her had induced her to leaveher father&rsquo;s house, as he meant to take her to the richest and mostdelightful city in the whole world, which was Naples; and that she,ill-advised and deluded, had believed him, and robbed her father, andhanded over all to him the night she disappeared; and that he had carriedher away to a rugged mountain and shut her up in the cave where they hadfound her. She said, moreover, that the soldier, without robbing her ofher honour, had taken from her everything she had, and made off, leavingher in the cave, a thing that still further surprised everybody. It wasnot easy for us to credit the young man&rsquo;s continence, but she asserted itwith such earnestness that it helped to console her distressed father, whothought nothing of what had been taken since the jewel that once lost cannever be recovered had been left to his daughter. The same day thatLeandra made her appearance her father removed her from our sight and tookher away to shut her up in a convent in a town near this, in the hope thattime may wear away some of the disgrace she has incurred. Leandra&rsquo;s youthfurnished an excuse for her fault, at least with those to whom it was ofno consequence whether she was good or bad; but those who knew hershrewdness and intelligence did not attribute her misdemeanour toignorance but to wantonness and the natural disposition of women, which isfor the most part flighty and ill-regulated.</p><p>Leandra withdrawn from sight, Anselmo&rsquo;s eyes grew blind, or at any ratefound nothing to look at that gave them any pleasure, and mine were indarkness without a ray of light to direct them to anything enjoyable whileLeandra was away. Our melancholy grew greater, our patience grew less; wecursed the soldier&rsquo;s finery and railed at the carelessness of Leandra&rsquo;sfather. At last Anselmo and I agreed to leave the village and come to thisvalley; and, he feeding a great flock of sheep of his own, and I a largeherd of goats of mine, we pass our life among the trees, giving vent toour sorrows, together singing the fair Leandra&rsquo;s praises, or upbraidingher, or else sighing alone, and to heaven pouring forth our complaints insolitude. Following our example, many more of Leandra&rsquo;s lovers have cometo these rude mountains and adopted our mode of life, and they are sonumerous that one would fancy the place had been turned into the pastoralArcadia, so full is it of shepherds and sheep-folds; nor is there a spotin it where the name of the fair Leandra is not heard. Here one curses herand calls her capricious, fickle, and immodest, there another condemns heras frail and frivolous; this pardons and absolves her, that spurns andreviles her; one extols her beauty, another assails her character, and inshort all abuse her, and all adore her, and to such a pitch has thisgeneral infatuation gone that there are some who complain of her scornwithout ever having exchanged a word with her, and even some that bewailand mourn the raging fever of jealousy, for which she never gave anyonecause, for, as I have already said, her misconduct was known before herpassion. There is no nook among the rocks, no brookside, no shade beneaththe trees that is not haunted by some shepherd telling his woes to thebreezes; wherever there is an echo it repeats the name of Leandra; themountains ring with &ldquo;Leandra,&rdquo; &ldquo;Leandra&rdquo; murmur the brooks, and Leandrakeeps us all bewildered and bewitched, hoping without hope and fearingwithout knowing what we fear. Of all this silly set the one that shows theleast and also the most sense is my rival Anselmo, for having so manyother things to complain of, he only complains of separation, and to theaccompaniment of a rebeck, which he plays admirably, he sings hiscomplaints in verses that show his ingenuity. I follow another, easier,and to my mind wiser course, and that is to rail at the frivolity ofwomen, at their inconstancy, their double dealing, their broken promises,their unkept pledges, and in short the want of reflection they show infixing their affections and inclinations. This, sirs, was the reason ofwords and expressions I made use of to this goat when I came up just now;for as she is a female I have a contempt for her, though she is the bestin all my fold. This is the story I promised to tell you, and if I havebeen tedious in telling it, I will not be slow to serve you; my hut isclose by, and I have fresh milk and dainty cheese there, as well as avariety of toothsome fruit, no less pleasing to the eye than to thepalate.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c51e" id="c51e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c51e.jpg (14K)" src="images/c51e.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch52" id="ch52"></a>CHAPTER LII.<br/>OF THE QUARREL THAT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE GOATHERD, TOGETHER WITH THERARE ADVENTURE OF THE PENITENTS, WHICH WITH AN EXPENDITURE OF SWEAT HEBROUGHT TO A HAPPY CONCLUSION</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="c52a" id="c52a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c52a.jpg (40K)" src="images/c52a.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c52a.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The goatherd&rsquo;s tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers, and thecanon especially enjoyed it, for he had remarked with particular attentionthe manner in which it had been told, which was as unlike the manner of aclownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished city wit; and heobserved that the curate had been quite right in saying that the woodsbred men of learning. They all offered their services to Eugenio but hewho showed himself most liberal in this way was Don Quixote, who said tohim, &ldquo;Most assuredly, brother goatherd, if I found myself in a position toattempt any adventure, I would, this very instant, set out on your behalf,and would rescue Leandra from that convent (where no doubt she is keptagainst her will), in spite of the abbess and all who might try to preventme, and would place her in your hands to deal with her according to yourwill and pleasure, observing, however, the laws of chivalry which lay downthat no violence of any kind is to be offered to any damsel. But I trustin God our Lord that the might of one malignant enchanter may not prove sogreat but that the power of another better disposed may prove superior toit, and then I promise you my support and assistance, as I am bound to doby my profession, which is none other than to give aid to the weak andneedy.&rdquo;</p><p>The goatherd eyed him, and noticing Don Quixote&rsquo;s sorry appearance andlooks, he was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was next him,&ldquo;Señor, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such astrain?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who should it be,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;but the famous Don Quixote of LaMancha, the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protector ofdamsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the goatherd, &ldquo;sounds like what one reads in the books of theknights-errant, who did all that you say this man does; though it is mybelief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman has emptylodgings in his head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are a great scoundrel,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and it is you who areempty and a fool. I am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that boreyou;&rdquo; and passing from words to deeds, he caught up a loaf that was nearhim and sent it full in the goatherd&rsquo;s face, with such force that heflattened his nose; but the goatherd, who did not understand jokes, andfound himself roughly handled in such good earnest, paying no respect tocarpet, tablecloth, or diners, sprang upon Don Quixote, and seizing him bythe throat with both hands would no doubt have throttled him, had notSancho Panza that instant come to the rescue, and grasping him by theshoulders flung him down on the table, smashing plates, breaking glasses,and upsetting and scattering everything on it. Don Quixote, findinghimself free, strove to get on top of the goatherd, who, with his facecovered with blood, and soundly kicked by Sancho, was on all fours feelingabout for one of the table-knives to take a bloody revenge with. The canonand the curate, however, prevented him, but the barber so contrived itthat he got Don Quixote under him, and rained down upon him such a showerof fisticuffs that the poor knight&rsquo;s face streamed with blood as freely ashis own. The canon and the curate were bursting with laughter, theofficers were capering with delight, and both the one and the other hissedthem on as they do dogs that are worrying one another in a fight. Sanchoalone was frantic, for he could not free himself from the grasp of one ofthe canon&rsquo;s servants, who kept him from going to his master&rsquo;s assistance.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c52b" id="c52b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c52b.jpg (348K)" src="images/c52b.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c52b.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>At last, while they were all, with the exception of the two bruisers whowere mauling each other, in high glee and enjoyment, they heard a trumpetsound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the direction whencethe sound seemed to come. But the one that was most excited by hearing itwas Don Quixote, who though sorely against his will he was under thegoatherd, and something more than pretty well pummelled, said to him,&ldquo;Brother devil (for it is impossible but that thou must be one since thouhast had might and strength enough to overcome mine), I ask thee to agreeto a truce for but one hour for the solemn note of yonder trumpet thatfalls on our ears seems to me to summon me to some new adventure.&rdquo; Thegoatherd, who was by this time tired of pummelling and being pummelled,released him at once, and Don Quixote rising to his feet and turning hiseyes to the quarter where the sound had been heard, suddenly saw comingdown the slope of a hill several men clad in white like penitents.</p><p>The fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture fromthe earth, and in all the villages of the district they were organisingprocessions, rogations, and penances, imploring God to open the hands ofhis mercy and send the rain; and to this end the people of a village thatwas hard by were going in procession to a holy hermitage there was on oneside of that valley. Don Quixote when he saw the strange garb of thepenitents, without reflecting how often he had seen it before, took itinto his head that this was a case of adventure, and that it fell to himalone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the moreconfirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black theyhad with them was some illustrious lady that these villains anddiscourteous thieves were carrying off by force. As soon as this occurredto him he ran with all speed to Rocinante who was grazing at large, andtaking the bridle and the buckler from the saddle-bow, he had him bridledin an instant, and calling to Sancho for his sword he mounted Rocinante,braced his buckler on his arm, and in a loud voice exclaimed to those whostood by, &ldquo;Now, noble company, ye shall see how important it is that thereshould be knights in the world professing the order of knight-errantry; now, Isay, ye shall see, by the deliverance of that worthy lady who is bornecaptive there, whether knights-errant deserve to be held in estimation,&rdquo;and so saying he brought his legs to bear on Rocinante&mdash;for he had nospurs&mdash;and at a full canter (for in all this veracious history wenever read of Rocinante fairly galloping) set off to encounter thepenitents, though the curate, the canon, and the barber ran to preventhim. But it was out of their power, nor did he even stop for the shouts ofSancho calling after him, &ldquo;Where are you going, Señor Don Quixote? Whatdevils have possessed you to set you on against our Catholic faith? Plaguetake me! mind, that is a procession of penitents, and the lady they arecarrying on that stand there is the blessed image of the immaculateVirgin. Take care what you are doing, señor, for this time it may besafely said you don&rsquo;t know what you are about.&rdquo; Sancho laboured in vain,for his master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheetedfigures and releasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word; andeven had he heard, he would not have turned back if the king had orderedhim. He came up with the procession and reined in Rocinante, who wasalready anxious enough to slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse, excitedvoice he exclaimed, &ldquo;You who hide your faces, perhaps because you are notgood subjects, pay attention and listen to what I am about to say to you.&rdquo;The first to halt were those who were carrying the image, and one of thefour ecclesiastics who were chanting the Litany, struck by the strangefigure of Don Quixote, the leanness of Rocinante, and the other ludicrouspeculiarities he observed, said in reply to him, &ldquo;Brother, if you haveanything to say to us say it quickly, for these brethren are whippingthemselves, and we cannot stop, nor is it reasonable we should stop tohear anything, unless indeed it is short enough to be said in two words.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will say it in one,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;and it is this; that atonce, this very instant, ye release that fair lady whose tears and sadaspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her will, andthat ye have committed some scandalous outrage against her; and I, who wasborn into the world to redress all such like wrongs, will not permit youto advance another step until you have restored to her the liberty shepines for and deserves.&rdquo;</p><p>From these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman, andbegan to laugh heartily, and their laughter acted like gunpowder on DonQuixote&rsquo;s fury, for drawing his sword without another word he made a rushat the stand. One of those who supported it, leaving the burden to hiscomrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing a forked stick that he had forpropping up the stand when resting, and with this he caught a mighty cutDon Quixote made at him that severed it in two; but with the portion thatremained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the shoulder of DonQuixote&rsquo;s sword arm (which the buckler could not protect against theclownish assault) that poor Don Quixote came to the ground in a sadplight.</p><p>Sancho Panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing, seeinghim fall, cried out to his assailant not to strike him again, for he was apoor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the days of hislife; but what checked the clown was, not Sancho&rsquo;s shouting, but seeingthat Don Quixote did not stir hand or foot; and so, fancying he had killedhim, he hastily hitched up his tunic under his girdle and took to hisheels across the country like a deer.</p><p>By this time all Don Quixote&rsquo;s companions had come up to where he lay; butthe processionists seeing them come running, and with them the officers ofthe Brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended mischief, and clusteringround the image, raised their hoods, and grasped their scourges, as thepriests did their tapers, and awaited the attack, resolved to defendthemselves and even to take the offensive against their assailants if theycould. Fortune, however, arranged the matter better than they expected,for all Sancho did was to fling himself on his master&rsquo;s body, raising overhim the most doleful and laughable lamentation that ever was heard, for hebelieved he was dead. The curate was known to another curate who walked inthe procession, and their recognition of one another set at rest theapprehensions of both parties; the first then told the other in two wordswho Don Quixote was, and he and the whole troop of penitents went to seeif the poor gentleman was dead, and heard Sancho Panza saying, with tearsin his eyes, &ldquo;Oh flower of chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hastended the course of thy well-spent life! Oh pride of thy race, honour andglory of all La Mancha, nay, of all the world, that for want of thee willbe full of evil-doers, no longer in fear of punishment for their misdeeds!Oh thou, generous above all the Alexanders, since for only eight months ofservice thou hast given me the best island the sea girds or surrounds!Humble with the proud, haughty with the humble, encounterer of dangers,endurer of outrages, enamoured without reason, imitator of the good,scourge of the wicked, enemy of the mean, in short, knight-errant, whichis all that can be said!&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="c52c" id="c52c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="c52c.jpg (325K)" src="images/c52c.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /></div><p><a href="images/c52c.jpg" style="width:100%;" ><img alt="Full Size" src="images/enlarge.jpg"  /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>At the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to himself, and thefirst word he said was, &ldquo;He who lives separated from you, sweetestDulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. Aid me, friendSancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a condition to pressthe saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to pieces.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I will do with all my heart, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;and let us returnto our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and there we willprepare for making another sally, which may turn out more profitable andcreditable to us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art right, Sancho,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote; &ldquo;It will be wise to letthe malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off.&rdquo;</p><p>The canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely indoing as he said; and so, highly amused at Sancho Panza&rsquo;s simplicities,they placed Don Quixote in the cart as before. The procession once moreformed itself in order and proceeded on its road; the goatherd took hisleave of the party; the officers of the Brotherhood declined to go anyfarther, and the curate paid them what was due to them; the canon beggedthe curate to let him know how Don Quixote did, whether he was cured ofhis madness or still suffered from it, and then begged leave to continuehis journey; in short, they all separated and went their ways, leaving tothemselves the curate and the barber, Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and thegood Rocinante, who regarded everything with as great resignation as hismaster. The carter yoked his oxen and made Don Quixote comfortable on atruss of hay, and at his usual deliberate pace took the road the curatedirected, and at the end of six days they reached Don Quixote&rsquo;s village,and entered it about the middle of the day, which it so happened was aSunday, and the people were all in the plaza, through which Don Quixote&rsquo;scart passed. They all flocked to see what was in the cart, and when theyrecognised their townsman they were filled with amazement, and a boy ranoff to bring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that their masterand uncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss ofhay on an ox-cart. It was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladiesraised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions onthose accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when they saw DonQuixote coming in at the gate.</p><p>At the news of Don Quixote&rsquo;s arrival Sancho Panza&rsquo;s wife came running, forshe by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him as hissquire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she asked him was if the asswas well. Sancho replied that he was, better than his master was.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks be to God,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for being so good to me; but now tell me,my friend, what have you made by your squirings? What gown have youbrought me back? What shoes for your children?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I bring nothing of that sort, wife,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;though I bring otherthings of more consequence and value.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am very glad of that,&rdquo; returned his wife; &ldquo;show me these things of morevalue and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheer my heartthat has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have been away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will show them to you at home, wife,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;be content for thepresent; for if it please God that we should again go on our travels insearch of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or governor of anisland, and that not one of those everyday ones, but the best that is tobe had.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Heaven grant it, husband,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for indeed we have need of it. Buttell me, what&rsquo;s this about islands, for I don&rsquo;t understand it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Honey is not for the mouth of the ass,&rdquo; returned Sancho; &ldquo;all in goodtime thou shalt see, wife&mdash;nay, thou wilt be surprised to hearthyself called &lsquo;your ladyship&rsquo; by all thy vassals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, andvassals?&rdquo; returned Teresa Panza&mdash;for so Sancho&rsquo;s wife was called,though they were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wivesto take their husbands&rsquo; surnames.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;it isenough that I am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth. But I may tellyou this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world moredelightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to aknight-errant, and a seeker of adventures. To be sure most of those onefinds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred,ninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary. I know it by experience, forout of some I came blanketed, and out of others belaboured. Still, for allthat, it is a fine thing to be on the look-out for what may happen,crossing mountains, searching woods, climbing rocks, visiting castles,putting up at inns, all at free quarters, and devil take the maravedi topay.&rdquo;</p><p>While this conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, DonQuixote&rsquo;s housekeeper and niece took him in and undressed him and laid himin his old bed. He eyed them askance, and could not make out where he was.The curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her unclecomfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make his escapefrom them again, telling her what they had been obliged to do to bring himhome. On this the pair once more lifted up their voices and renewed theirmaledictions upon the books of chivalry, and implored heaven to plunge theauthors of such lies and nonsense into the midst of the bottomless pit.They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dread lest their uncle and mastershould give them the slip the moment he found himself somewhat better, andas they feared so it fell out.</p><p>But the author of this history, though he has devoted research andindustry to the discovery of the deeds achieved by Don Quixote in histhird sally, has been unable to obtain any information respecting them, atany rate derived from authentic documents; tradition has merely preservedin the memory of La Mancha the fact that Don Quixote, the third time hesallied forth from his home, betook himself to Saragossa, where he waspresent at some famous jousts which came off in that city, and that he hadadventures there worthy of his valour and high intelligence. Of his endand death he could learn no particulars, nor would he have ascertained itor known of it, if good fortune had not produced an old physician for himwho had in his possession a leaden box, which, according to his account,had been discovered among the crumbling foundations of an ancienthermitage that was being rebuilt; in which box were found certainparchment manuscripts in Gothic character, but in Castilian verse,containing many of his achievements, and setting forth the beauty ofDulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the fidelity of Sancho Panza, and theburial of Don Quixote himself, together with sundry epitaphs and eulogieson his life and character; but all that could be read and deciphered werethose which the trustworthy author of this new and unparalleled historyhere presents. And the said author asks of those that shall read itnothing in return for the vast toil which it has cost him in examining andsearching the Manchegan archives in order to bring it to light, save thatthey give him the same credit that people of sense give to the books ofchivalry that pervade the world and are so popular; for with this he willconsider himself amply paid and fully satisfied, and will be encouraged toseek out and produce other histories, if not as truthful, at least equalin invention and not less entertaining.

Andhe who has shown the greatest longing for him has been the great Emperorof China, who wrote me a letter in Chinese a month ago and sent it by aspecial courier. He asked me, or to be truthful, he begged me to send himDon Quixote, for he intended to found a college where the Spanish tonguewould be taught, and it was his wish that the book to be read should bethe History of Don Quixote.

Thou wouldst have me call him ass, fool, andmalapert, but I have no such intention; let his offence be his punishment,with his bread let him eat it, and there&rsquo;s an end of it. What Icannot help taking amiss is that he charges me with being old andone-handed, as if it had been in my power to keep time from passing overme, or as if the loss of my hand had been brought about in some tavern,and not on the grandest occasion the past or present has seen, or thefuture can hope to see. If my wounds have no beauty to the beholder&rsquo;seye, they are, at least, honourable in the estimation of those who knowwhere they were received; for the soldier shows to greater advantage deadin battle than alive in flight; and so strongly is this my feeling, thatif now it were proposed to perform an impossibility for me, I would ratherhave had my share in that mighty action, than be free from my wounds thisminute without having been present at it. Those the soldier shows on hisface and breast are stars that direct others to the heaven of honour andambition of merited praise; and moreover it is to be observed that it isnot with grey hairs that one writes, but with the understanding, and thatcommonly improves with years. I take it amiss, too, that he calls meenvious, and explains to me, as if I were ignorant, what envy is; forreally and truly, of the two kinds there are, I only know that which isholy, noble, and high-minded; and if that be so, as it is, I am not likelyto attack a priest, above all if, in addition, he holds the rank offamiliar of the Holy Office. And if he said what he did on account of himon whose behalf it seems he spoke, he is entirely mistaken; for I worshipthe genius of that person, and admire his works and his unceasing andstrenuous industry. After all, I am grateful to this gentleman, theauthor, for saying that my novels are more satirical than exemplary, butthat they are good; for they could not be that unless there was a littleof everything in them.</p><p>I suspect thou wilt say that I am taking a very humble line, and keepingmyself too much within the bounds of my moderation, from a feeling thatadditional suffering should not be inflicted upon a sufferer, and thatwhat this gentleman has to endure must doubtless be very great, as he doesnot dare to come out into the open field and broad daylight, but hides hisname and disguises his country as if he had been guilty of some lesemajesty. If perchance thou shouldst come to know him, tell him from methat I do not hold myself aggrieved; for I know well what the temptationsof the devil are, and that one of the greatest is putting it into a man&rsquo;shead that he can write and print a book by which he will get as much fameas money, and as much money as fame; and to prove it I will beg of you, inyour own sprightly, pleasant way, to tell him this story.</p><p>There was a madman in Seville who took to one of the drollest absurditiesand vagaries that ever madman in the world gave way to. It was this: hemade a tube of reed sharp at one end, and catching a dog in the street, orwherever it might be, he with his foot held one of its legs fast, and withhis hand lifted up the other, and as best he could fixed the tube where,by blowing, he made the dog as round as a ball; then holding it in thisposition, he gave it a couple of slaps on the belly, and let it go, sayingto the bystanders (and there were always plenty of them): &ldquo;Do yourworships think, now, that it is an easy thing to blow up a dog?&rdquo;&mdash;Doesyour worship think now, that it is an easy thing to write a book?</p><p>And if this story does not suit him, you may, dear reader, tell him thisone, which is likewise of a madman and a dog.</p><p>In Cordova there was another madman, whose way it was to carry a piece ofmarble slab or a stone, not of the lightest, on his head, and when he cameupon any unwary dog he used to draw close to him and let the weight fallright on top of him; on which the dog in a rage, barking and howling,would run three streets without stopping. It so happened, however, thatone of the dogs he discharged his load upon was a cap-maker&rsquo;s dog,of which his master was very fond. The stone came down hitting it on thehead, the dog raised a yell at the blow, the master saw the affair and waswroth, and snatching up a measuring-yard rushed out at the madman and didnot leave a sound bone in his body, and at every stroke he gave him hesaid, &ldquo;You dog, you thief! my lurcher! Don&rsquo;t you see, youbrute, that my dog is a lurcher?&rdquo; and so, repeating the word &ldquo;lurcher&rdquo;again and again, he sent the madman away beaten to a jelly. The madmantook the lesson to heart, and vanished, and for more than a month neveronce showed himself in public; but after that he came out again with hisold trick and a heavier load than ever. He came up to where there was adog, and examining it very carefully without venturing to let the stonefall, he said: &ldquo;This is a lurcher; ware!&rdquo; In short, all thedogs he came across, be they mastiffs or terriers, he said were lurchers;and he discharged no more stones. Maybe it will be the same with thishistorian; that he will not venture another time to discharge the weightof his wit in books, which, being bad, are harder than stones. Tell him,too, that I do not care a farthing for the threat he holds out to me ofdepriving me of my profit by means of his book; for, to borrow from thefamous interlude of &ldquo;The Perendenga,&rdquo; I say in answer to him,&ldquo;Long life to my lord the Veintiquatro, and Christ be with us all.&rdquo;Long life to the great Conde de Lemos, whose Christian charity andwell-known generosity support me against all the strokes of my curstfortune; and long life to the supreme benevolence of His Eminence ofToledo, Don Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas; and what matter if there be noprinting-presses in the world, or if they print more books against me thanthere are letters in the verses of Mingo Revulgo! These two princes,unsought by any adulation or flattery of mine, of their own goodnessalone, have taken it upon them to show me kindness and protect me, and inthis I consider myself happier and richer than if Fortune had raised me toher greatest height in the ordinary way. The poor man may retain honour,but not the vicious; poverty may cast a cloud over nobility, but cannothide it altogether; and as virtue of itself sheds a certain light, eventhough it be through the straits and chinks of penury, it wins the esteemof lofty and noble spirits, and in consequence their protection. Thouneedst say no more to him, nor will I say anything more to thee, save totell thee to bear in mind that this Second Part of &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo;which I offer thee is cut by the same craftsman and from the same cloth asthe First, and that in it I present thee Don Quixote continued, and atlength dead and buried, so that no one may dare to bring forward anyfurther evidence against him, for that already produced is sufficient; andsuffice it, too, that some reputable person should have given an accountof all these shrewd lunacies of his without going into the matter again;for abundance, even of good things, prevents them from being valued; andscarcity, even in the case of what is bad, confers a certain value. I wasforgetting to tell thee that thou mayest expect the &ldquo;Persiles,&rdquo;which I am now finishing, and also the Second Part of &ldquo;Galatea.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="part2e" id="part2e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="part2e.jpg (37K)" src="images/part2e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch1b" id="ch1b"></a>CHAPTER I.<br/>OF THE INTERVIEW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER HAD WITH DON QUIXOTE ABOUT HISMALADY</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p01a" id="p01a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p01a.jpg (156K)" src="images/p01a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p01a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Cide Hamete Benengeli, in the Second Part of this history, and third sallyof Don Quixote, says that the curate and the barber remained nearly amonth without seeing him, lest they should recall or bring back to hisrecollection what had taken place. They did not, however, omit to visithis niece and housekeeper, and charge them to be careful to treat him withattention, and give him comforting things to eat, and such as were goodfor the heart and the brain, whence, it was plain to see, all hismisfortune proceeded. The niece and housekeeper replied that they did so,and meant to do so with all possible care and assiduity, for they couldperceive that their master was now and then beginning to show signs ofbeing in his right mind. This gave great satisfaction to the curate andthe barber, for they concluded they had taken the right course in carryinghim off enchanted on the ox-cart, as has been described in the First Partof this great as well as accurate history, in the last chapter thereof. Sothey resolved to pay him a visit and test the improvement in hiscondition, although they thought it almost impossible that there could beany; and they agreed not to touch upon any point connected withknight-errantry so as not to run the risk of reopening wounds which werestill so tender.</p><p>They came to see him consequently, and found him sitting up in bed in agreen baize waistcoat and a red Toledo cap, and so withered and dried upthat he looked as if he had been turned into a mummy. They were verycordially received by him; they asked him after his health, and he talkedto them about himself very naturally and in very well-chosen language. Inthe course of their conversation they fell to discussing what they callState-craft and systems of government, correcting this abuse andcondemning that, reforming one practice and abolishing another, each ofthe three setting up for a new legislator, a modern Lycurgus, or abrand-new Solon; and so completely did they remodel the State, that theyseemed to have thrust it into a furnace and taken out something quitedifferent from what they had put in; and on all the subjects they dealtwith, Don Quixote spoke with such good sense that the pair of examinerswere fully convinced that he was quite recovered and in his full senses.</p><p>The niece and housekeeper were present at the conversation and could notfind words enough to express their thanks to God at seeing their master soclear in his mind; the curate, however, changing his original plan, whichwas to avoid touching upon matters of chivalry, resolved to test DonQuixote&rsquo;s recovery thoroughly, and see whether it were genuine ornot; and so, from one subject to another, he came at last to talk of thenews that had come from the capital, and, among other things, he said itwas considered certain that the Turk was coming down with a powerfulfleet, and that no one knew what his purpose was, or when the great stormwould burst; and that all Christendom was in apprehension of this, whichalmost every year calls us to arms, and that his Majesty had madeprovision for the security of the coasts of Naples and Sicily and theisland of Malta.</p><p>To this Don Quixote replied, &ldquo;His Majesty has acted like a prudentwarrior in providing for the safety of his realms in time, so that theenemy may not find him unprepared; but if my advice were taken I wouldrecommend him to adopt a measure which at present, no doubt, his Majestyis very far from thinking of.&rdquo;</p><p>The moment the curate heard this he said to himself, &ldquo;God keep theein his hand, poor Don Quixote, for it seems to me thou art precipitatingthyself from the height of thy madness into the profound abyss of thysimplicity.&rdquo;</p><p>But the barber, who had the same suspicion as the curate, asked DonQuixote what would be his advice as to the measures that he said ought tobe adopted; for perhaps it might prove to be one that would have to beadded to the list of the many impertinent suggestions that people were inthe habit of offering to princes.</p><p>&ldquo;Mine, master shaver,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;will not beimpertinent, but, on the contrary, pertinent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;but thatexperience has shown that all or most of the expedients which are proposedto his Majesty are either impossible, or absurd, or injurious to the Kingand to the kingdom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mine, however,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;is neitherimpossible nor absurd, but the easiest, the most reasonable, the readiestand most expeditious that could suggest itself to any projector&rsquo;smind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You take a long time to tell it, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; said thecurate.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t choose to tell it here, now,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;and have it reach the ears of the lords of the council to-morrowmorning, and some other carry off the thanks and rewards of my trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;I give my word here andbefore God that I will not repeat what your worship says, to King, Rook orearthly man&mdash;an oath I learned from the ballad of the curate, who, inthe prelude, told the king of the thief who had robbed him of the hundredgold crowns and his pacing mule.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not versed in stories,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but Iknow the oath is a good one, because I know the barber to be an honestfellow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even if he were not,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;I will go bailand answer for him that in this matter he will be as silent as a dummy,under pain of paying any penalty that may be pronounced.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And who will be security for you, señor curate?&rdquo; said DonQuixote.</p><p>&ldquo;My profession,&rdquo; replied the curate, &ldquo;which is to keepsecrets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ods body!&rdquo; said Don Quixote at this, &ldquo;what more has hisMajesty to do but to command, by public proclamation, all theknights-errant that are scattered over Spain to assemble on a fixed day inthe capital, for even if no more than half a dozen come, there may be oneamong them who alone will suffice to destroy the entire might of the Turk.Give me your attention and follow me. Is it, pray, any new thing for asingle knight-errant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men, asif they all had but one throat or were made of sugar paste? Nay, tell me,how many histories are there filled with these marvels? If only (in anevil hour for me: I don&rsquo;t speak for anyone else) the famous DonBelianis were alive now, or anyone of the innumerable progeny of Amadisof Gaul! If any these were alive to-day, and were to come face to face withthe Turk, by my faith, I would not give much for the Turk&rsquo;s chance.But God will have regard for his people, and will provide someone, who,if not so valiant as the knights-errant of yore, at least will not beinferior to them in spirit; but God knows what I mean, and I say no more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; exclaimed the niece at this, &ldquo;may I die if mymaster does not want to turn knight-errant again;&rdquo; to which DonQuixote replied, &ldquo;A knight-errant I shall die, and let the Turk comedown or go up when he likes, and in as strong force as he can, once more Isay, God knows what I mean.&rdquo; But here the barber said, &ldquo;I askyour worships to give me leave to tell a short story of something thathappened in Seville, which comes so pat to the purpose just now that Ishould like greatly to tell it.&rdquo; Don Quixote gave him leave, and therest prepared to listen, and he began thus:</p><p>&ldquo;In the madhouse at Seville there was a man whom his relations hadplaced there as being out of his mind. He was a graduate of Osuna in canonlaw; but even if he had been of Salamanca, it was the opinion of mostpeople that he would have been mad all the same. This graduate, after someyears of confinement, took it into his head that he was sane and in hisfull senses, and under this impression wrote to the Archbishop, entreatinghim earnestly, and in very correct language, to have him released from themisery in which he was living; for by God&rsquo;s mercy he had nowrecovered his lost reason, though his relations, in order to enjoy hisproperty, kept him there, and, in spite of the truth, would make him outto be mad until his dying day. The Archbishop, moved by repeated sensible,well-written letters, directed one of his chaplains to make inquiry of themadhouse as to the truth of the licentiate&rsquo;s statements, and to havean interview with the madman himself, and, if it should appear that he wasin his senses, to take him out and restore him to liberty. The chaplaindid so, and the governor assured him that the man was still mad, and thatthough he often spoke like a highly intelligent person, he would in theend break out into nonsense that in quantity and quality counterbalancedall the sensible things he had said before, as might be easily tested bytalking to him. The chaplain resolved to try the experiment, and obtainingaccess to the madman conversed with him for an hour or more, during thewhole of which time he never uttered a word that was incoherent or absurd,but, on the contrary, spoke so rationally that the chaplain was compelledto believe him to be sane. Among other things, he said the governor wasagainst him, not to lose the presents his relations made him for reportinghim still mad but with lucid intervals; and that the worst foe he had inhis misfortune was his large property; for in order to enjoy it hisenemies disparaged and threw doubts upon the mercy our Lord had shown himin turning him from a brute beast into a man. In short, he spoke in such away that he cast suspicion on the governor, and made his relations appearcovetous and heartless, and himself so rational that the chaplaindetermined to take him away with him that the Archbishop might see him,and ascertain for himself the truth of the matter. Yielding to thisconviction, the worthy chaplain begged the governor to have the clothes inwhich the licentiate had entered the house given to him. The governoragain bade him beware of what he was doing, as the licentiate was beyond adoubt still mad; but all his cautions and warnings were unavailing todissuade the chaplain from taking him away. The governor, seeing that itwas the order of the Archbishop, obeyed, and they dressed the licentiatein his own clothes, which were new and decent. He, as soon as he sawhimself clothed like one in his senses, and divested of the appearance ofa madman, entreated the chaplain to permit him in charity to go and takeleave of his comrades the madmen. The chaplain said he would go with himto see what madmen there were in the house; so they went upstairs, andwith them some of those who were present. Approaching a cage in whichthere was a furious madman, though just at that moment calm and quiet, thelicentiate said to him, &lsquo;Brother, think if you have any commands forme, for I am going home, as God has been pleased, in his infinite goodnessand mercy, without any merit of mine, to restore me my reason. I am nowcured and in my senses, for with God&rsquo;s power nothing is impossible.Have strong hope and trust in him, for as he has restored me to myoriginal condition, so likewise he will restore you if you trust in him. Iwill take care to send you some good things to eat; and be sure you eatthem; for I would have you know I am convinced, as one who has gonethrough it, that all this madness of ours comes of having the stomachempty and the brains full of wind. Take courage! take courage! fordespondency in misfortune breaks down health and brings on death.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cageopposite that of the furious one was listening; and raising himself upfrom an old mat on which he lay stark naked, he asked in a loud voice whoit was that was going away cured and in his senses. The licentiateanswered, &lsquo;It is I, brother, who am going; I have now no need toremain here any longer, for which I return infinite thanks to Heaven thathas had so great mercy upon me.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mind what you are saying, licentiate; don&rsquo;t let thedevil deceive you,&rsquo; replied the madman. &lsquo;Keep quiet, staywhere you are, and you will save yourself the trouble of coming back.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know I am cured,&rsquo; returned the licentiate, &lsquo;andthat I shall not have to go stations again.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You cured!&rsquo; said the madman; &lsquo;well, we shallsee; God be with you; but I swear to you by Jupiter, whose majesty Irepresent on earth, that for this crime alone, which Seville is committingto-day in releasing you from this house, and treating you as if you werein your senses, I shall have to inflict such a punishment on it as will beremembered for ages and ages, amen. Dost thou not know, thou miserablelittle licentiate, that I can do it, being, as I say, Jupiter theThunderer, who hold in my hands the fiery bolts with which I am able andam wont to threaten and lay waste the world? But in one way only will Ipunish this ignorant town, and that is by not raining upon it, nor on anypart of its district or territory, for three whole years, to be reckonedfrom the day and moment when this threat is pronounced. Thou free, thoucured, thou in thy senses! and I mad, I disordered, I bound! I will assoon think of sending rain as of hanging myself.</p><p>&ldquo;Those present stood listening to the words and exclamations of themadman; but our licentiate, turning to the chaplain and seizing him by thehands, said to him, &lsquo;Be not uneasy, señor; attach no importance towhat this madman has said; for if he is Jupiter and will not send rain, I,who am Neptune, the father and god of the waters, will rain as often as itpleases me and may be needful.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The governor and the bystanders laughed, and at their laughter thechaplain was half ashamed, and he replied, &lsquo;For all that, SeñorNeptune, it will not do to vex Señor Jupiter; remain where you are, andsome other day, when there is a better opportunity and more time, we willcome back for you.&rsquo; So they stripped the licentiate, and he was leftwhere he was; and that&rsquo;s the end of the story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the story, master barber,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;which came in so pat to the purpose that you could not help tellingit? Master shaver, master shaver! how blind is he who cannot see through asieve. Is it possible that you do not know that comparisons of wit withwit, valour with valour, beauty with beauty, birth with birth, are alwaysodious and unwelcome? I, master barber, am not Neptune, the god of thewaters, nor do I try to make anyone take me for an astute man, for I amnot one. My only endeavour is to convince the world of the mistake itmakes in not reviving in itself the happy time when the order ofknight-errantry was in the field. But our depraved age does not deserve toenjoy such a blessing as those ages enjoyed when knights-errant took upontheir shoulders the defence of kingdoms, the protection of damsels, thesuccour of orphans and minors, the chastisement of the proud, and therecompense of the humble. With the knights of these days, for the mostpart, it is the damask, brocade, and rich stuffs they wear, that rustle asthey go, not the chain mail of their armour; no knight now-a-days sleepsin the open field exposed to the inclemency of heaven, and in full panoplyfrom head to foot; no one now takes a nap, as they call it, withoutdrawing his feet out of the stirrups, and leaning upon his lance, as theknights-errant used to do; no one now, issuing from the wood, penetratesyonder mountains, and then treads the barren, lonely shore of the sea&mdash;mostlya tempestuous and stormy one&mdash;and finding on the beach a little barkwithout oars, sail, mast, or tackling of any kind, in the intrepidity ofhis heart flings himself into it and commits himself to the wrathfulbillows of the deep sea, that one moment lift him up to heaven and thenext plunge him into the depths; and opposing his breast to theirresistible gale, finds himself, when he least expects it, three thousandleagues and more away from the place where he embarked; and leaping ashorein a remote and unknown land has adventures that deserve to be written,not on parchment, but on brass. But now sloth triumphs over energy,indolence over exertion, vice over virtue, arrogance over courage, andtheory over practice in arms, which flourished and shone only in thegolden ages and in knights-errant. For tell me, who was more virtuous andmore valiant than the famous Amadis of Gaul? Who more discreet thanPalmerin of England? Who more gracious and easy than Tirante el Blanco?Who more courtly than Lisuarte of Greece? Who more slashed or slashingthan Don Belianis? Who more intrepid than Perion of Gaul? Who more readyto face danger than Felixmarte of Hircania? Who more sincere thanEsplandian? Who more impetuous than Don Cirongilio of Thrace? Who morebold than Rodamonte? Who more prudent than King Sobrino? Who more daringthan Reinaldos? Who more invincible than Roland? and who more gallant andcourteous than Ruggiero, from whom the dukes of Ferrara of the present dayare descended, according to Turpin in his &lsquo;Cosmography.&rsquo; Allthese knights, and many more that I could name, señor curate, wereknights-errant, the light and glory of chivalry. These, or such as these,I would have to carry out my plan, and in that case his Majesty would findhimself well served and would save great expense, and the Turk would beleft tearing his beard. And so I will stay where I am, as the chaplaindoes not take me away; and if Jupiter, as the barber has told us, will notsend rain, here am I, and I will rain when I please. I say this thatMaster Basin may know that I understand him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;I did notmean it in that way, and, so help me God, my intention was good, and yourworship ought not to be vexed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As to whether I ought to be vexed or not,&rdquo; returned DonQuixote, &ldquo;I myself am the best judge.&rdquo;</p><p>Hereupon the curate observed, &ldquo;I have hardly said a word as yet; andI would gladly be relieved of a doubt, arising from what Don Quixote hassaid, that worries and works my conscience.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The señor curate has leave for more than that,&rdquo; returned DonQuixote, &ldquo;so he may declare his doubt, for it is not pleasant tohave a doubt on one&rsquo;s conscience.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, with that permission,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;Isay my doubt is that, all I can do, I cannot persuade myself that thewhole pack of knights-errant you, Señor Don Quixote, have mentioned, werereally and truly persons of flesh and blood, that ever lived in the world;on the contrary, I suspect it to be all fiction, fable, and falsehood, anddreams told by men awakened from sleep, or rather still half asleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is another mistake,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;intowhich many have fallen who do not believe that there ever were suchknights in the world, and I have often, with divers people and on diversoccasions, tried to expose this almost universal error to the light oftruth. Sometimes I have not been successful in my purpose, sometimes Ihave, supporting it upon the shoulders of the truth; which truth is soclear that I can almost say I have with my own eyes seen Amadis of Gaul,who was a man of lofty stature, fair complexion, with a handsome thoughblack beard, of a countenance between gentle and stern in expression,sparing of words, slow to anger, and quick to put it away from him; and asI have depicted Amadis, so I could, I think, portray and describe all theknights-errant that are in all the histories in the world; for by theperception I have that they were what their histories describe, and by thedeeds they did and the dispositions they displayed, it is possible, withthe aid of sound philosophy, to deduce their features, complexion, andstature.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How big, in your worship&rsquo;s opinion, may the giant Morgantehave been, Señor Don Quixote?&rdquo; asked the barber.</p><p>&ldquo;With regard to giants,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;opinionsdiffer as to whether there ever were any or not in the world; but the HolyScripture, which cannot err by a jot from the truth, shows us that therewere, when it gives us the history of that big Philistine, Goliath, whowas seven cubits and a half in height, which is a huge size. Likewise, inthe island of Sicily, there have been found leg-bones and arm-bones solarge that their size makes it plain that their owners were giants, and astall as great towers; geometry puts this fact beyond a doubt. But, for allthat, I cannot speak with certainty as to the size of Morgante, though Isuspect he cannot have been very tall; and I am inclined to be of thisopinion because I find in the history in which his deeds are particularlymentioned, that he frequently slept under a roof and as he found houses tocontain him, it is clear that his bulk could not have been anythingexcessive.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the curate, and yielding to the enjoymentof hearing such nonsense, he asked him what was his notion of the featuresof Reinaldos of Montalban, and Don Roland and the rest of the Twelve Peersof France, for they were all knights-errant.</p><p>&ldquo;As for Reinaldos,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;I venture tosay that he was broad-faced, of ruddy complexion, with roguish andsomewhat prominent eyes, excessively punctilious and touchy, and given tothe society of thieves and scapegraces. With regard to Roland, orRotolando, or Orlando (for the histories call him by all these names), Iam of opinion, and hold, that he was of middle height, broad-shouldered,rather bow-legged, swarthy-complexioned, red-bearded, with a hairy bodyand a severe expression of countenance, a man of few words, but verypolite and well-bred.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If Roland was not a more graceful person than your worship hasdescribed,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;it is no wonder that the fairLady Angelica rejected him and left him for the gaiety, liveliness, andgrace of that budding-bearded little Moor to whom she surrendered herself;and she showed her sense in falling in love with the gentle softness ofMedoro rather than the roughness of Roland.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That Angelica, señor curate,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;wasa giddy damsel, flighty and somewhat wanton, and she left the world asfull of her vagaries as of the fame of her beauty. She treated with scorna thousand gentlemen, men of valour and wisdom, and took up with asmooth-faced sprig of a page, without fortune or fame, except suchreputation for gratitude as the affection he bore his friend got for him.The great poet who sang her beauty, the famous Ariosto, not caring to singher adventures after her contemptible surrender (which probably were notover and above creditable), dropped her where he says:</p><p class="poem">How she received the sceptre of Cathay,<br/>Some bard of defter quill may sing some day;</p><p class="noindent">and this was no doubt a kind of prophecy, for poets are also called<i>vates</i>, that is to say diviners; and its truth was made plain; for sincethen a famous Andalusian poet has lamented and sung her tears, and anotherfamous and rare poet, a Castilian, has sung her beauty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; said the barber here, &ldquo;amongall those who praised her, has there been no poet to write a satire onthis Lady Angelica?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can well believe,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;that ifSacripante or Roland had been poets they would have given the damsel atrimming; for it is naturally the way with poets who have been scorned andrejected by their ladies, whether fictitious or not, in short by thosewhom they select as the ladies of their thoughts, to avenge themselves insatires and libels&mdash;a vengeance, to be sure, unworthy of generoushearts; but up to the present I have not heard of any defamatory verseagainst the Lady Angelica, who turned the world upside down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; said the curate; but at this moment they heard thehousekeeper and the niece, who had previously withdrawn from theconversation, exclaiming aloud in the courtyard, and at the noise they allran out.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p01e" id="p01e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p01e.jpg (15K)" src="images/p01e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch2b" id="ch2b"></a>CHAPTER II.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF THE NOTABLE ALTERCATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HAD WITH DONQUIXOTE&rsquo;S NIECE, AND HOUSEKEEPER, TOGETHER WITH OTHER DROLL MATTERS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p02a" id="p02a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p02a.jpg (159K)" src="images/p02a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p02a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The history relates that the outcry Don Quixote, the curate, and thebarber heard came from the niece and the housekeeper exclaiming to Sancho,who was striving to force his way in to see Don Quixote while they heldthe door against him, &ldquo;What does the vagabond want in this house?

He enticed me away from home by a trick, promising me an island,which I am still waiting for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May evil islands choke thee, thou detestable Sancho,&rdquo; saidthe niece; &ldquo;What are islands? Is it something to eat, glutton andgormandiser that thou art?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is not something to eat,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;butsomething to govern and rule, and better than four cities or fourjudgeships at court.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said the housekeeper, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;tenter here, you bag of mischief and sack of knavery; go govern your houseand dig your seed-patch, and give over looking for islands or shylands.&rdquo;</p><p>The curate and the barber listened with great amusement to the words ofthe three; but Don Quixote, uneasy lest Sancho should blab and blurt out awhole heap of mischievous stupidities, and touch upon points that mightnot be altogether to his credit, called to him and made the other two holdtheir tongues and let him come in. Sancho entered, and the curate and thebarber took their leave of Don Quixote, of whose recovery they despairedwhen they saw how wedded he was to his crazy ideas, and how saturated withthe nonsense of his unlucky chivalry; and said the curate to the barber,&ldquo;You will see, gossip, that when we are least thinking of it, ourgentleman will be off once more for another flight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have no doubt of it,&rdquo; returned the barber; &ldquo;but I donot wonder so much at the madness of the knight as at the simplicity ofthe squire, who has such a firm belief in all that about the island, thatI suppose all the exposures that could be imagined would not get it out ofhis head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God help them,&rdquo; said the curate; &ldquo;and let us be on thelook-out to see what comes of all these absurdities of the knight andsquire, for it seems as if they had both been cast in the same mould, andthe madness of the master without the simplicity of the man would not beworth a farthing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the barber, &ldquo;and I should like verymuch to know what the pair are talking about at this moment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I promise you,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;the niece or thehousekeeper will tell us by-and-by, for they are not the ones to forget tolisten.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile Don Quixote shut himself up in his room with Sancho, and whenthey were alone he said to him, &ldquo;It grieves me greatly, Sancho, thatthou shouldst have said, and sayest, that I took thee out of thy cottage,when thou knowest I did not remain in my house. We sallied forth together,we took the road together, we wandered abroad together; we have had thesame fortune and the same luck; if they blanketed thee once, theybelaboured me a hundred times, and that is the only advantage I have ofthee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was only reasonable,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;for, bywhat your worship says, misfortunes belong more properly to knights-errantthan to their squires.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art mistaken, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;accordingto the maxim <i>quando caput dolet</i>, etc.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand any language but my own,&rdquo; saidSancho.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean to say,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that when the headsuffers all the members suffer; and so, being thy lord and master, I amthy head, and thou a part of me as thou art my servant; and therefore anyevil that affects or shall affect me should give thee pain, and whataffects thee give pain to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It should be so,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;but when I wasblanketed as a member, my head was on the other side of the wall, lookingon while I was flying through the air, and did not feel any pain whatever;and if the members are obliged to feel the suffering of the head, itshould be obliged to feel their sufferings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dost thou mean to say now, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;thatI did not feel when they were blanketing thee? If thou dost, thou must notsay so or think so, for I felt more pain then in spirit than thou didst inbody. But let us put that aside for the present, for we shall haveopportunities enough for considering and settling the point; tell me,Sancho my friend, what do they say about me in the village here? What dothe common people think of me? What do the hidalgos? What do thecaballeros? What do they say of my valour; of my achievements; of mycourtesy? How do they treat the task I have undertaken in reviving andrestoring to the world the now forgotten order of chivalry? In short,Sancho, I would have thee tell me all that has come to thine ears on thissubject; and thou art to tell me, without adding anything to the good ortaking away anything from the bad; for it is the duty of loyal vassals totell the truth to their lords just as it is and in its proper shape, notallowing flattery to add to it or any idle deference to lessen it. And Iwould have thee know, Sancho, that if the naked truth, undisguised byflattery, came to the ears of princes, times would be different, and otherages would be reckoned iron ages more than ours, which I hold to be thegolden of these latter days. Profit by this advice, Sancho, and report tome clearly and faithfully the truth of what thou knowest touching what Ihave demanded of thee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I will do with all my heart, master,&rdquo; replied Sancho,&ldquo;provided your worship will not be vexed at what I say, as you wishme to say it out in all its nakedness, without putting any more clothes onit than it came to my knowledge in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will not be vexed at all,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote; &ldquo;thoumayest speak freely, Sancho, and without any beating about the bush.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;first of all, I have to tell youthat the common people consider your worship a mighty great madman, and meno less a fool. The hidalgos say that, not keeping within the bounds ofyour quality of gentleman, you have assumed the &lsquo;Don,&rsquo; andmade a knight of yourself at a jump, with four vine-stocks and a couple ofacres of land, and never a shirt to your back. The caballeros say they donot want to have hidalgos setting up in opposition to them, particularlysquire hidalgos who polish their own shoes and darn their black stockingswith green silk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;does not apply to me, for Ialways go well dressed and never patched; ragged I may be, but ragged morefrom the wear and tear of arms than of time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As to your worship&rsquo;s valour, courtesy, accomplishments, andtask, there is a variety of opinions. Some say, &lsquo;mad but droll;&rsquo;others, &lsquo;valiant but unlucky;&rsquo; others, &lsquo;courteous butmeddling,&rsquo; and then they go into such a number of things that theydon&rsquo;t leave a whole bone either in your worship or in myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Recollect, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that wherevervirtue exists in an eminent degree it is persecuted. Few or none of thefamous men that have lived escaped being calumniated by malice. JuliusCæsar, the boldest, wisest, and bravest of captains, was charged withbeing ambitious, and not particularly cleanly in his dress, or pure in hismorals. Of Alexander, whose deeds won him the name of Great, they say thathe was somewhat of a drunkard. Of Hercules, him of the many labours, it issaid that he was lewd and luxurious. Of Don Galaor, the brother of Amadisof Gaul, it was whispered that he was over-quarrelsome, and of his brotherthat he was lachrymose. So that, O Sancho, amongst all these calumniesagainst good men, mine may be let pass, since they are no more than thouhast said.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where it is, body of my father!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there more, then?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the tail to be skinned yet,&rdquo; said Sancho;&ldquo;all so far is cakes and fancy bread; but if your worship wants toknow all about the calumnies they bring against you, I will fetch you onethis instant who can tell you the whole of them without missing an atom;for last night the son of Bartholomew Carrasco, who has been studying atSalamanca, came home after having been made a bachelor, and when I went towelcome him, he told me that your worship&rsquo;s history is alreadyabroad in books, with the title of THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN DON QUIXOTE OFLA MANCHA; and he says they mention me in it by my own name of SanchoPanza, and the lady Dulcinea del Toboso too, and divers things thathappened to us when we were alone; so that I crossed myself in my wonderhow the historian who wrote them down could have known them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I promise thee, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;the authorof our history will be some sage enchanter; for to such nothing that theychoose to write about is hidden.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;a sage and an enchanter! Why, thebachelor Samson Carrasco (that is the name of him I spoke of) says theauthor of the history is called Cide Hamete Berengena.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is a Moorish name,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;May be so,&rdquo; replied Sancho; &ldquo;for I have heard say thatthe Moors are mostly great lovers of berengenas.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou must have mistaken the surname of this &lsquo;Cide&rsquo;&mdash;whichmeans in Arabic &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;&mdash;Sancho,&rdquo; observed DonQuixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;but if your worshipwishes me to fetch the bachelor I will go for him in a twinkling.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou wilt do me a great pleasure, my friend,&rdquo; said DonQuixote, &ldquo;for what thou hast told me has amazed me, and I shall noteat a morsel that will agree with me until I have heard all about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I am off for him,&rdquo; said Sancho; and leaving his masterhe went in quest of the bachelor, with whom he returned in a short time,and, all three together, they had a very droll colloquy.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p02e" id="p02e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p02e.jpg (23K)" src="images/p02e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch3b" id="ch3b"></a>CHAPTER III.<br/>OF THE LAUGHABLE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE, SANCHOPANZA, AND THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p03a" id="p03a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p03a.jpg (131K)" src="images/p03a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p03a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote remained very deep in thought, waiting for the bachelorCarrasco, from whom he was to hear how he himself had been put into a bookas Sancho said; and he could not persuade himself that any such historycould be in existence, for the blood of the enemies he had slain was notyet dry on the blade of his sword, and now they wanted to make out thathis mighty achievements were going about in print. For all that, hefancied some sage, either a friend or an enemy, might, by the aid ofmagic, have given them to the press; if a friend, in order to magnify andexalt them above the most famous ever achieved by any knight-errant; if anenemy, to bring them to naught and degrade them below the meanest everrecorded of any low squire, though as he said to himself, the achievementsof squires never were recorded. If, however, it were the fact that such ahistory were in existence, it must necessarily, being the story of aknight-errant, be grandiloquent, lofty, imposing, grand and true. Withthis he comforted himself somewhat, though it made him uncomfortable tothink that the author was a Moor, judging by the title of &ldquo;Cide;&rdquo;and that no truth was to be looked for from Moors, as they are allimpostors, cheats, and schemers. He was afraid he might have dealt withhis love affairs in some indecorous fashion, that might tend to thediscredit and prejudice of the purity of his lady Dulcinea del Toboso; hewould have had him set forth the fidelity and respect he had alwaysobserved towards her, spurning queens, empresses, and damsels of allsorts, and keeping in check the impetuosity of his natural impulses.Absorbed and wrapped up in these and divers other cogitations, he wasfound by Sancho and Carrasco, whom Don Quixote received with greatcourtesy.</p><p>The bachelor, though he was called Samson, was of no great bodily size,but he was a very great wag; he was of a sallow complexion, but verysharp-witted, somewhere about four-and-twenty years of age, with a roundface, a flat nose, and a large mouth, all indications of a mischievousdisposition and a love of fun and jokes; and of this he gave a sample assoon as he saw Don Quixote, by falling on his knees before him and saying,&ldquo;Let me kiss your mightiness&rsquo;s hand, Señor Don Quixote of LaMancha, for, by the habit of St. Peter that I wear, though I have no morethan the first four orders, your worship is one of the most famousknights-errant that have ever been, or will be, all the world over. Ablessing on Cide Hamete Benengeli, who has written the history of yourgreat deeds, and a double blessing on that connoisseur who took thetrouble of having it translated out of the Arabic into our Castilianvulgar tongue for the universal entertainment of the people!&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote made him rise, and said, &ldquo;So, then, it is true thatthere is a history of me, and that it was a Moor and a sage who wrote it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So true is it, señor,&rdquo; said Samson, &ldquo;that my belief isthere are more than twelve thousand volumes of the said history in printthis very day. Only ask Portugal, Barcelona, and Valencia, where they havebeen printed, and moreover there is a report that it is being printed atAntwerp, and I am persuaded there will not be a country or language inwhich there will not be a translation of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One of the things,&rdquo; here observed Don Quixote, &ldquo;thatought to give most pleasure to a virtuous and eminent man is to findhimself in his lifetime in print and in type, familiar in people&rsquo;smouths with a good name; I say with a good name, for if it be theopposite, then there is no death to be compared to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If it goes by good name and fame,&rdquo; said the bachelor, &ldquo;yourworship alone bears away the palm from all the knights-errant; for theMoor in his own language, and the Christian in his, have taken care to setbefore us your gallantry, your high courage in encountering dangers, yourfortitude in adversity, your patience under misfortunes as well as wounds,the purity and continence of the platonic loves of your worship and mylady Doña Dulcinea del Toboso&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never heard my lady Dulcinea called Doña,&rdquo; observed Sanchohere; &ldquo;nothing more than the lady Dulcinea del Toboso; so herealready the history is wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is not an objection of any importance,&rdquo; repliedCarrasco.</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but tell me, señorbachelor, what deeds of mine are they that are made most of in thishistory?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On that point,&rdquo; replied the bachelor, &ldquo;opinions differ,as tastes do; some swear by the adventure of the windmills that yourworship took to be Briareuses and giants; others by that of the fullingmills; one cries up the description of the two armies that afterwards tookthe appearance of two droves of sheep; another that of the dead body onits way to be buried at Segovia; a third says the liberation of the galleyslaves is the best of all, and a fourth that nothing comes up to theaffair with the Benedictine giants, and the battle with the valiantBiscayan.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, señor bachelor,&rdquo; said Sancho at this point, &ldquo;doesthe adventure with the Yanguesans come in, when our good Rocinante wenthankering after dainties?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The sage has left nothing in the ink-bottle,&rdquo; replied Samson;&ldquo;he tells all and sets down everything, even to the capers thatworthy Sancho cut in the blanket.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cut no capers in the blanket,&rdquo; returned Sancho; &ldquo;inthe air I did, and more of them than I liked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no human history in the world, I suppose,&rdquo; said DonQuixote, &ldquo;that has not its ups and downs, but more than others suchas deal with chivalry, for they can never be entirely made up ofprosperous adventures.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; replied the bachelor, &ldquo;there are thosewho have read the history who say they would have been glad if the authorhad left out some of the countless cudgellings that were inflicted onSeñor Don Quixote in various encounters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the truth of the history comes in,&rdquo; saidSancho.</p><p>&ldquo;At the same time they might fairly have passed them over insilence,&rdquo; observed Don Quixote; &ldquo;for there is no need ofrecording events which do not change or affect the truth of a history, ifthey tend to bring the hero of it into contempt. Æneas was not in truthand earnest so pious as Virgil represents him, nor Ulysses so wise asHomer describes him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Samson; &ldquo;but it is one thing towrite as a poet, another to write as a historian; the poet may describe orsing things, not as they were, but as they ought to have been; but thehistorian has to write them down, not as they ought to have been, but asthey were, without adding anything to the truth or taking anything fromit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;if this señor Moor goes infor telling the truth, no doubt among my master&rsquo;s drubbings mine areto be found; for they never took the measure of his worship&rsquo;sshoulders without doing the same for my whole body; but I have no right towonder at that, for, as my master himself says, the members must share thepain of the head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are a sly dog, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;i&rsquo;faith, you have no want of memory when you choose to remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I were to try to forget the thwacks they gave me,&rdquo; saidSancho, &ldquo;my weals would not let me, for they are still fresh on myribs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hush, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;tinterrupt the bachelor, whom I entreat to go on and tell all that is saidabout me in this history.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And about me,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for they say, too, that Iam one of the principal presonages in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Personages, not presonages, friend Sancho,&rdquo; said Samson.</p><p>&ldquo;What! Another word-catcher!&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;if that&rsquo;sto be the way we shall not make an end in a lifetime.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May God shorten mine, Sancho,&rdquo; returned the bachelor, &ldquo;ifyou are not the second person in the history, and there are even some whowould rather hear you talk than the cleverest in the whole book; thoughthere are some, too, who say you showed yourself over-credulous inbelieving there was any possibility in the government of that islandoffered you by Señor Don Quixote.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is still sunshine on the wall,&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;and when Sancho is somewhat more advanced in life, with theexperience that years bring, he will be fitter and better qualified forbeing a governor than he is at present.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God, master,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;the island that I cannotgovern with the years I have, I&rsquo;ll not be able to govern with theyears of Methuselah; the difficulty is that the said island keeps itsdistance somewhere, I know not where; and not that there is any want ofhead in me to govern it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave it to God, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for allwill be and perhaps better than you think; no leaf on the tree stirs butby God&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Samson; &ldquo;and if it be God&rsquo;swill, there will not be any want of a thousand islands, much less one, forSancho to govern.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have seen governors in these parts,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;thatare not to be compared to my shoe-sole; and for all that they are called&lsquo;your lordship&rsquo; and served on silver.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Those are not governors of islands,&rdquo; observed Samson, &ldquo;butof other governments of an easier kind: those that govern islands must atleast know grammar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I could manage the gram well enough,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;butfor the mar I have neither leaning nor liking, for I don&rsquo;t know whatit is; but leaving this matter of the government in God&rsquo;s hands, tosend me wherever it may be most to his service, I may tell you, señorbachelor Samson Carrasco, it has pleased me beyond measure that the authorof this history should have spoken of me in such a way that what is saidof me gives no offence; for, on the faith of a true squire, if he had saidanything about me that was at all unbecoming an old Christian, such as Iam, the deaf would have heard of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That would be working miracles,&rdquo; said Samson.</p><p>&ldquo;Miracles or no miracles,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;let everyonemind how he speaks or writes about people, and not set down at random thefirst thing that comes into his head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One of the faults they find with this history,&rdquo; said thebachelor, &ldquo;is that its author inserted in it a novel called &lsquo;TheIll-advised Curiosity;&rsquo; not that it is bad or ill-told, but that itis out of place and has nothing to do with the history of his worshipSeñor Don Quixote.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will bet the son of a dog has mixed the cabbages and the baskets,&rdquo;said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Then, I say,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;the author of my historywas no sage, but some ignorant chatterer, who, in a haphazard and heedless way,set about writing it, let it turn out as it might, just as Orbaneja, thepainter of Úbeda, used to do, who, when they asked him what he was painting,answered, &lsquo;What it may turn out.&rsquo; Sometimes he would paint a cockin such a fashion, and so unlike, that he had to write alongside of it inGothic letters, &lsquo;This is a cock;&rsquo; and so it will be with myhistory, which will require a commentary to make it intelligible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No fear of that,&rdquo; returned Samson, &ldquo;for it is so plainthat there is nothing in it to puzzle over; the children turn its leaves,the young people read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk praiseit; in a word, it is so thumbed, and read, and got by heart by people ofall sorts, that the instant they see any lean hack, they say, &lsquo;Theregoes Rocinante.&rsquo; And those that are most given to reading it are thepages, for there is not a lord&rsquo;s ante-chamber where there is not a&lsquo;Don Quixote&rsquo; to be found; one takes it up if another lays itdown; this one pounces upon it, and that begs for it. In short, the saidhistory is the most delightful and least injurious entertainment that hasbeen hitherto seen, for there is not to be found in the whole of it eventhe semblance of an immodest word, or a thought that is other thanCatholic.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To write in any other way,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;would not beto write truth, but falsehood, and historians who have recourse to falsehoodought to be burned, like those who coin false money; and I know not what couldhave led the author to have recourse to novels and irrelevant stories, when hehad so much to write about in mine; no doubt he must have gone by the proverb&lsquo;with straw or with hay, &amp;c.,&rsquo; for by merely setting forth mythoughts, my sighs, my tears, my lofty purposes, my enterprises, he might havemade a volume as large, or larger than all the works of El Tostado would makeup. In fact, the conclusion I arrive at, señor bachelor, is, that to writehistories, or books of any kind, there is need of great judgment and a ripeunderstanding. To give expression to humour, and write in a strain of gracefulpleasantry, is the gift of great geniuses. The cleverest character in comedy isthe clown, for he who would make people take him for a fool, must not be one.History is in a measure a sacred thing, for it should be true, and where thetruth is, there God is; but notwithstanding this, there are some who write andfling books broadcast on the world as if they were fritters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no book so bad but it has something good in it,&rdquo;said the bachelor.</p><p>&ldquo;No doubt of that,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;but it oftenhappens that those who have acquired and attained a well-deservedreputation by their writings, lose it entirely, or damage it in somedegree, when they give them to the press.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The reason of that,&rdquo; said Samson, &ldquo;is, that as printedworks are examined leisurely, their faults are easily seen; and thegreater the fame of the writer, the more closely are they scrutinised. Menfamous for their genius, great poets, illustrious historians, are always,or most commonly, envied by those who take a particular delight andpleasure in criticising the writings of others, without having producedany of their own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is no wonder,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;for there aremany divines who are no good for the pulpit, but excellent in detectingthe defects or excesses of those who preach.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that is true, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; said Carrasco; &ldquo;but Iwish such fault-finders were more lenient and less exacting, and did not pay somuch attention to the spots on the bright sun of the work they grumble at; forif <i>aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus</i>, they should remember how long heremained awake to shed the light of his work with as little shade as possible;and perhaps it may be that what they find fault with may be moles, thatsometimes heighten the beauty of the face that bears them; and so I say verygreat is the risk to which he who prints a book exposes himself, for of allimpossibilities the greatest is to write one that will satisfy and please allreaders.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That which treats of me must have pleased few,&rdquo; said DonQuixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Quite the contrary,&rdquo; said the bachelor; &ldquo;for, as<i>stultorum infinitum est numerus</i>, innumerable are those who have relishedthe said history; but some have brought a charge against the author&rsquo;smemory, inasmuch as he forgot to say who the thief was who stole Sancho&rsquo;sDapple; for it is not stated there, but only to be inferred from what is setdown, that he was stolen, and a little farther on we see Sancho mounted on thesame ass, without any reappearance of it. They say, too, that he forgot tostate what Sancho did with those hundred crowns that he found in the valise inthe Sierra Morena, as he never alludes to them again, and there are many whowould be glad to know what he did with them, or what he spent them on, for itis one of the serious omissions of the work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor Samson, I am not in a humour now for going into accounts orexplanations,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s a sinking ofthe stomach come over me, and unless I doctor it with a couple of sups ofthe old stuff it will put me on the thorn of Santa Lucia. I have it athome, and my old woman is waiting for me; after dinner I&rsquo;ll comeback, and will answer you and all the world every question you may chooseto ask, as well about the loss of the ass as about the spending of thehundred crowns;&rdquo; and without another word or waiting for a reply hemade off home.</p><p>Don Quixote begged and entreated the bachelor to stay and do penance withhim. The bachelor accepted the invitation and remained, a couple of youngpigeons were added to the ordinary fare, at dinner they talked chivalry,Carrasco fell in with his host&rsquo;s humour, the banquet came to an end,they took their afternoon sleep, Sancho returned, and their conversationwas resumed.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p03e" id="p03e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p03e.jpg (49K)" src="images/p03e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch4b" id="ch4b"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br/>IN WHICH SANCHO PANZA GIVES A SATISFACTORY REPLY TO THE DOUBTS ANDQUESTIONS OF THE BACHELOR SAMSON CARRASCO, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERSWORTH KNOWING AND TELLING</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p04a" id="p04a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p04a.jpg (143K)" src="images/p04a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p04a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Sancho came back to Don Quixote&rsquo;s house, and returning to the latesubject of conversation, he said, &ldquo;As to what Señor Samson said,that he would like to know by whom, or how, or when my ass was stolen, Isay in reply that the same night we went into the Sierra Morena, flyingfrom the Holy Brotherhood after that unlucky adventure of the galleyslaves, and the other of the corpse that was going to Segovia, my masterand I ensconced ourselves in a thicket, and there, my master leaning onhis lance, and I seated on my Dapple, battered and weary with the latefrays we fell asleep as if it had been on four feather mattresses; and Iin particular slept so sound, that, whoever he was, he was able to comeand prop me up on four stakes, which he put under the four corners of thepack-saddle in such a way that he left me mounted on it, and took awayDapple from under me without my feeling it.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p04b" id="p04b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p04b.jpg (270K)" src="images/p04b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p04b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;That is an easy matter,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and it isno new occurrence, for the same thing happened to Sacripante at the siegeof Albracca; the famous thief, Brunello, by the same contrivance, took hishorse from between his legs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Day came,&rdquo; continued Sancho, &ldquo;and the moment I stirredthe stakes gave way and I fell to the ground with a mighty come down; Ilooked about for the ass, but could not see him; the tears rushed to myeyes and I raised such a lamentation that, if the author of our historyhas not put it in, he may depend upon it he has left out a good thing.Some days after, I know not how many, travelling with her ladyship thePrincess Micomicona, I saw my ass, and mounted upon him, in the dress of agipsy, was that Gines de Pasamonte, the great rogue and rascal that mymaster and I freed from the chain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is not where the mistake is,&rdquo; replied Samson; &ldquo;itis, that before the ass has turned up, the author speaks of Sancho asbeing mounted on it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say to that,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;unlessthat the historian made a mistake, or perhaps it might be a blunder of theprinter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No doubt that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Samson; &ldquo;but whatbecame of the hundred crowns? Did they vanish?&rdquo;</p><p>To which Sancho answered, &ldquo;I spent them for my own good, and my wife&rsquo;s,and my children&rsquo;s, and it is they that have made my wife bear sopatiently all my wanderings on highways and byways, in the service of mymaster, Don Quixote; for if after all this time I had come back to thehouse without a rap and without the ass, it would have been a poorlook-out for me; and if anyone wants to know anything more about me, hereI am, ready to answer the king himself in person; and it is no affair ofanyone&rsquo;s whether I took or did not take, whether I spent or did notspend; for the whacks that were given me in these journeys were to be paidfor in money, even if they were valued at no more than four maravedisapiece, another hundred crowns would not pay me for half of them. Let eachlook to himself and not try to make out white black, and black white; foreach of us is as God made him, aye, and often worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will take care,&rdquo; said Carrasco, &ldquo;to impress upon theauthor of the history that, if he prints it again, he must not forget whatworthy Sancho has said, for it will raise it a good span higher.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there anything else to correct in the history, señor bachelor?&rdquo;asked Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;No doubt there is,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;but not anything thatwill be of the same importance as those I have mentioned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does the author promise a second part at all?&rdquo; said DonQuixote.</p><p>&ldquo;He does promise one,&rdquo; replied Samson; &ldquo;but he says hehas not found it, nor does he know who has got it; and we cannot saywhether it will appear or not; and so, on that head, as some say that nosecond part has ever been good, and others that enough has been alreadywritten about Don Quixote, it is thought there will be no second part;though some, who are jovial rather than saturnine, say, &lsquo;Let us havemore Quixotades, let Don Quixote charge and Sancho chatter, and no matterwhat it may turn out, we shall be satisfied with that.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what does the author mean to do?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; replied Samson; &ldquo;why, as soon as he has foundthe history which he is now searching for with extraordinary diligence, hewill at once give it to the press, moved more by the profit that mayaccrue to him from doing so than by any thought of praise.&rdquo;</p><p>Whereat Sancho observed, &ldquo;The author looks for money and profit,does he? It will be a wonder if he succeeds, for it will be only hurry,hurry, with him, like the tailor on Easter Eve; and works done in a hurryare never finished as perfectly as they ought to be. Let master Moor, orwhatever he is, pay attention to what he is doing, and I and my masterwill give him as much grouting ready to his hand, in the way of adventuresand accidents of all sorts, as would make up not only one second part, buta hundred. The good man fancies, no doubt, that we are fast asleep in thestraw here, but let him hold up our feet to be shod and he will see whichfoot it is we go lame on. All I say is, that if my master would take myadvice, we would be now afield, redressing outrages and righting wrongs,as is the use and custom of good knights-errant.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho had hardly uttered these words when the neighing of Rocinante fellupon their ears, which neighing Don Quixote accepted as a happy omen, andhe resolved to make another sally in three or four days from that time.Announcing his intention to the bachelor, he asked his advice as to thequarter in which he ought to commence his expedition, and the bachelorreplied that in his opinion he ought to go to the kingdom of Aragon, andthe city of Saragossa, where there were to be certain solemn joustings atthe festival of St. George, at which he might win renown above all theknights of Aragon, which would be winning it above all the knights of theworld. He commended his very praiseworthy and gallant resolution, butadmonished him to proceed with greater caution in encountering dangers,because his life did not belong to him, but to all those who had need ofhim to protect and aid them in their misfortunes.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s where it is, what I abominate, Señor Samson,&rdquo;said Sancho here; &ldquo;my master will attack a hundred armed men as agreedy boy would half a dozen melons. Body of the world, señor bachelor!there is a time to attack and a time to retreat, and it is not to bealways &lsquo;Santiago, and close Spain!&rsquo; Moreover, I have heard itsaid (and I think by my master himself, if I remember rightly) that themean of valour lies between the extremes of cowardice and rashness; and ifthat be so, I don&rsquo;t want him to fly without having good reason, orto attack when the odds make it better not. But, above all things, I warnmy master that if he is to take me with him it must be on the conditionthat he is to do all the fighting, and that I am not to be called upon todo anything except what concerns keeping him clean and comfortable; inthis I will dance attendance on him readily; but to expect me to drawsword, even against rascally churls of the hatchet and hood, is idle. Idon&rsquo;t set up to be a fighting man, Señor Samson, but only the bestand most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant; and if my master DonQuixote, in consideration of my many faithful services, is pleased to giveme some island of the many his worship says one may stumble on in theseparts, I will take it as a great favour; and if he does not give it to me,I was born like everyone else, and a man must not live in dependence onanyone except God; and what is more, my bread will taste as well, andperhaps even better, without a government than if I were a governor; andhow do I know but that in these governments the devil may have preparedsome trip for me, to make me lose my footing and fall and knock mygrinders out? Sancho I was born and Sancho I mean to die. But for allthat, if heaven were to make me a fair offer of an island or somethingelse of the kind, without much trouble and without much risk, I am notsuch a fool as to refuse it; for they say, too, &lsquo;when they offerthee a heifer, run with a halter; and &lsquo;when good luck comes to thee,take it in.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Brother Sancho,&rdquo; said Carrasco, &ldquo;you have spoken like aprofessor; but, for all that, put your trust in God and in Señor DonQuixote, for he will give you a kingdom, not to say an island.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is all the same, be it more or be it less,&rdquo; repliedSancho; &ldquo;though I can tell Señor Carrasco that my master would notthrow the kingdom he might give me into a sack all in holes; for I havefelt my own pulse and I find myself sound enough to rule kingdoms andgovern islands; and I have before now told my master as much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take care, Sancho,&rdquo; said Samson; &ldquo;honours changemanners, and perhaps when you find yourself a governor you won&rsquo;tknow the mother that bore you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That may hold good of those that are born in the ditches,&rdquo;said Sancho, &ldquo;not of those who have the fat of an old Christian fourfingers deep on their souls, as I have. Nay, only look at my disposition,is that likely to show ingratitude to anyone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God grant it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;we shall see when thegovernment comes; and I seem to see it already.&rdquo;</p><p>He then begged the bachelor, if he were a poet, to do him the favour ofcomposing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to take ofhis lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and to see that a letter of her name wasplaced at the beginning of each line, so that, at the end of the verses,&ldquo;Dulcinea del Toboso&rdquo; might be read by putting together thefirst letters. The bachelor replied that although he was not one of thefamous poets of Spain, who were, they said, only three and a half, hewould not fail to compose the required verses; though he saw a greatdifficulty in the task, as the letters which made up the name wereseventeen; so, if he made four ballad stanzas of four lines each, therewould be a letter over, and if he made them of five, what they calleddecimas or redondillas, there were three letters short; nevertheless hewould try to drop a letter as well as he could, so that the name &ldquo;Dulcineadel Toboso&rdquo; might be got into four ballad stanzas.</p><p>&ldquo;It must be, by some means or other,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;for unless the name stands there plain and manifest, no woman wouldbelieve the verses were made for her.&rdquo;</p><p>They agreed upon this, and that the departure should take place in threedays from that time. Don Quixote charged the bachelor to keep it a secret,especially from the curate and Master Nicholas, and from his niece and thehousekeeper, lest they should prevent the execution of his praiseworthyand valiant purpose. Carrasco promised all, and then took his leave,charging Don Quixote to inform him of his good or evil fortunes wheneverhe had an opportunity; and thus they bade each other farewell, and Sanchowent away to make the necessary preparations for their expedition.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p04e" id="p04e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p04e.jpg (55K)" src="images/p04e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch5b" id="ch5b"></a>CHAPTER V.<br/>OF THE SHREWD AND DROLL CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN SANCHO PANZA ANDHIS WIFE TERESA PANZA, AND OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF BEING DULY RECORDED</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p05a" id="p05a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p05a.jpg (129K)" src="images/p05a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p05a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The translator of this history, when he comes to write this fifth chapter,says that he considers it apocryphal, because in it Sancho Panza speaks ina style unlike that which might have been expected from his limitedintelligence, and says things so subtle that he does not think it possiblehe could have conceived them; however, desirous of doing what his taskimposed upon him, he was unwilling to leave it untranslated, and thereforehe went on to say:</p><p>Sancho came home in such glee and spirits that his wife noticed hishappiness a bowshot off, so much so that it made her ask him, &ldquo;Whathave you got, Sancho friend, that you are so glad?&rdquo;</p><p>To which he replied, &ldquo;Wife, if it were God&rsquo;s will, I should bevery glad not to be so well pleased as I show myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, husband,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;andI don&rsquo;t know what you mean by saying you would be glad, if it wereGod&rsquo;s will, not to be well pleased; for, fool as I am, I don&rsquo;tknow how one can find pleasure in not having it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hark ye, Teresa,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;I am glad because Ihave made up my mind to go back to the service of my master Don Quixote,who means to go out a third time to seek for adventures; and I am goingwith him again, for my necessities will have it so, and also the hope thatcheers me with the thought that I may find another hundred crowns likethose we have spent; though it makes me sad to have to leave thee and thechildren; and if God would be pleased to let me have my daily bread,dry-shod and at home, without taking me out into the byways andcross-roads&mdash;and he could do it at small cost by merely willing it&mdash;itis clear my happiness would be more solid and lasting, for the happiness Ihave is mingled with sorrow at leaving thee; so that I was right in sayingI would be glad, if it were God&rsquo;s will, not to be well pleased.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look here, Sancho,&rdquo; said Teresa; &ldquo;ever since you joinedon to a knight-errant you talk in such a roundabout way that there is nounderstanding you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is enough that God understands me, wife,&rdquo; replied Sancho;&ldquo;for he is the understander of all things; that will do; but mind,sister, you must look to Dapple carefully for the next three days, so thathe may be fit to take arms; double his feed, and see to the pack-saddleand other harness, for it is not to a wedding we are bound, but to goround the world, and play at give and take with giants and dragons andmonsters, and hear hissings and roarings and bellowings and howlings; andeven all this would be lavender, if we had not to reckon with Yanguesansand enchanted Moors.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know well enough, husband,&rdquo; said Teresa, &ldquo;thatsquires-errant don&rsquo;t eat their bread for nothing, and so I will bealways praying to our Lord to deliver you speedily from all that hardfortune.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can tell you, wife,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;if I did notexpect to see myself governor of an island before long, I would drop downdead on the spot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nay, then, husband,&rdquo; said Teresa; &ldquo;let the hen live,though it be with her pip, live, and let the devil take all thegovernments in the world; you came out of your mother&rsquo;s womb withouta government, you have lived until now without a government, and when itis God&rsquo;s will you will go, or be carried, to your grave without agovernment. How many there are in the world who live without a government,and continue to live all the same, and are reckoned in the number of thepeople. The best sauce in the world is hunger, and as the poor are neverwithout that, they always eat with a relish. But mind, Sancho, if by goodluck you should find yourself with some government, don&rsquo;t forget meand your children. Remember that Sanchico is now full fifteen, and it isright he should go to school, if his uncle the abbot has a mind to havehim trained for the Church. Consider, too, that your daughter Mari-Sanchawill not die of grief if we marry her; for I have my suspicions that sheis as eager to get a husband as you to get a government; and, after all, adaughter looks better ill married than well whored.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By my faith,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;if God brings me to getany sort of a government, I intend, wife, to make such a high match forMari-Sancha that there will be no approaching her without calling her&lsquo;my lady.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nay, Sancho,&rdquo; returned Teresa; &ldquo;marry her to her equal,that is the safest plan; for if you put her out of wooden clogs intohigh-heeled shoes, out of her grey flannel petticoat into hoops and silkgowns, out of the plain &lsquo;Marica&rsquo; and &lsquo;thou,&rsquo; into&lsquo;Doña So-and-so&rsquo; and &lsquo;my lady,&rsquo; the girl won&rsquo;tknow where she is, and at every turn she will fall into a thousandblunders that will show the thread of her coarse homespun stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tut, you fool,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;it will be only topractise it for two or three years; and then dignity and decorum will fither as easily as a glove; and if not, what matter? Let her be &lsquo;mylady,&rsquo; and never mind what happens.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Keep to your own station, Sancho,&rdquo; replied Teresa; &ldquo;don&rsquo;ttry to raise yourself higher, and bear in mind the proverb that says,&lsquo;wipe the nose of your neigbbour&rsquo;s son, and take him into yourhouse.&rsquo; A fine thing it would be, indeed, to marry our Maria to somegreat count or grand gentleman, who, when the humour took him, would abuseher and call her clown-bred and clodhopper&rsquo;s daughter and spinningwench. I have not been bringing up my daughter for that all this time, Ican tell you, husband. Do you bring home money, Sancho, and leave marryingher to my care; there is Lope Tocho, Juan Tocho&rsquo;s son, a stout,sturdy young fellow that we know, and I can see he does not look sour atthe girl; and with him, one of our own sort, she will be well married, andwe shall have her always under our eyes, and be all one family, parentsand children, grandchildren and sons-in-law, and the peace and blessing ofGod will dwell among us; so don&rsquo;t you go marrying her in thosecourts and grand palaces where they won&rsquo;t know what to make of her,or she what to make of herself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, you idiot and wife for Barabbas,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;whatdo you mean by trying, without why or wherefore, to keep me from marryingmy daughter to one who will give me grandchildren that will be called&lsquo;your lordship&rsquo;? Look ye, Teresa, I have always heard myelders say that he who does not know how to take advantage of luck when itcomes to him, has no right to complain if it gives him the go-by; and nowthat it is knocking at our door, it will not do to shut it out; let us gowith the favouring breeze that blows upon us.&rdquo;</p><p>It is this sort of talk, and what Sancho says lower down, that made thetranslator of the history say he considered this chapter apocryphal.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see, you animal,&rdquo; continued Sancho, &ldquo;thatit will be well for me to drop into some profitable government that willlift us out of the mire, and marry Mari-Sancha to whom I like; and youyourself will find yourself called &lsquo;Doña Teresa Panza,&rsquo; andsitting in church on a fine carpet and cushions and draperies, in spiteand in defiance of all the born ladies of the town? No, stay as you are,growing neither greater nor less, like a tapestry figure&mdash;Let us sayno more about it, for Sanchica shall be a countess, say what you will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure of all you say, husband?&rdquo; replied Teresa.&ldquo;Well, for all that, I am afraid this rank of countess for mydaughter will be her ruin. You do as you like, make a duchess or aprincess of her, but I can tell you it will not be with my will andconsent. I was always a lover of equality, brother, and I can&rsquo;t bearto see people give themselves airs without any right. They called meTeresa at my baptism, a plain, simple name, without any additions or tagsor fringes of Dons or Doñas; Cascajo was my father&rsquo;s name, and as Iam your wife, I am called Teresa Panza, though by right I ought to becalled Teresa Cascajo; but &lsquo;kings go where laws like,&rsquo; and Iam content with this name without having the &lsquo;Don&rsquo; put on topof it to make it so heavy that I cannot carry it; and I don&rsquo;t wantto make people talk about me when they see me go dressed like a countessor governor&rsquo;s wife; for they will say at once, &lsquo;See what airsthe slut gives herself! Only yesterday she was always spinning flax, andused to go to mass with the tail of her petticoat over her head instead ofa mantle, and there she goes to-day in a hooped gown with her broaches andairs, as if we didn&rsquo;t know her!&rsquo; If God keeps me in my sevensenses, or five, or whatever number I have, I am not going to bring myselfto such a pass; go you, brother, and be a government or an island man, andswagger as much as you like; for by the soul of my mother, neither mydaughter nor I are going to stir a step from our village; a respectablewoman should have a broken leg and keep at home; and to be busy atsomething is a virtuous damsel&rsquo;s holiday; be off to your adventuresalong with your Don Quixote, and leave us to our misadventures, for Godwill mend them for us according as we deserve it. I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;msure, who fixed the &lsquo;Don&rsquo; to him, what neither his father norgrandfather ever had.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I declare thou hast a devil of some sort in thy body!&rdquo; saidSancho. &ldquo;God help thee, what a lot of things thou hast strungtogether, one after the other, without head or tail! What have Cascajo,and the broaches and the proverbs and the airs, to do with what I say?Look here, fool and dolt (for so I may call you, when you don&rsquo;tunderstand my words, and run away from good fortune), if I had said thatmy daughter was to throw herself down from a tower, or go roaming theworld, as the Infanta Doña Urraca wanted to do, you would be right in notgiving way to my will; but if in an instant, in less than the twinkling ofan eye, I put the &lsquo;Don&rsquo; and &lsquo;my lady&rsquo; on her back,and take her out of the stubble, and place her under a canopy, on a dais,and on a couch, with more velvet cushions than all the Almohades ofMorocco ever had in their family, why won&rsquo;t you consent and fall inwith my wishes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know why, husband?&rdquo; replied Teresa; &ldquo;because ofthe proverb that says &lsquo;who covers thee, discovers thee.&rsquo; Atthe poor man people only throw a hasty glance; on the rich man they fixtheir eyes; and if the said rich man was once on a time poor, it is thenthere is the sneering and the tattle and spite of backbiters; and in thestreets here they swarm as thick as bees.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look here, Teresa,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and listen to what Iam now going to say to you; maybe you never heard it in all your life; andI do not give my own notions, for what I am about to say are the opinionsof his reverence the preacher, who preached in this town last Lent, andwho said, if I remember rightly, that all things present that our eyesbehold, bring themselves before us, and remain and fix themselves on ourmemory much better and more forcibly than things past.&rdquo;</p><p>These observations which Sancho makes here are the other ones on account ofwhich the translator says he regards this chapter as apocryphal, inasmuchas they are beyond Sancho&rsquo;s capacity.</p><p>&ldquo;Whence it arises,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that when we see anyperson well dressed and making a figure with rich garments and retinue ofservants, it seems to lead and impel us perforce to respect him, thoughmemory may at the same moment recall to us some lowly condition in whichwe have seen him, but which, whether it may have been poverty or lowbirth, being now a thing of the past, has no existence; while the onlything that has any existence is what we see before us; and if this personwhom fortune has raised from his original lowly state (these were the verywords the padre used) to his present height of prosperity, be well bred,generous, courteous to all, without seeking to vie with those whosenobility is of ancient date, depend upon it, Teresa, no one will rememberwhat he was, and everyone will respect what he is, except indeed theenvious, from whom no fair fortune is safe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not understand you, husband,&rdquo; replied Teresa; &ldquo;doas you like, and don&rsquo;t break my head with any more speechifying andrethoric; and if you have revolved to do what you say&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Resolved, you should say, woman,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;notrevolved.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t set yourself to wrangle with me, husband,&rdquo; saidTeresa; &ldquo;I speak as God pleases, and don&rsquo;t deal inout-of-the-way phrases; and I say if you are bent upon having agovernment, take your son Sancho with you, and teach him from this time onhow to hold a government; for sons ought to inherit and learn the tradesof their fathers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As soon as I have the government,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;I willsend for him by post, and I will send thee money, of which I shall have nolack, for there is never any want of people to lend it to governors whenthey have not got it; and do thou dress him so as to hide what he is andmake him look what he is to be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You send the money,&rdquo; said Teresa, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll dresshim up for you as fine as you please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then we are agreed that our daughter is to be a countess,&rdquo;said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;The day that I see her a countess,&rdquo; replied Teresa, &ldquo;itwill be the same to me as if I was burying her; but once more I say do asyou please, for we women are born to this burden of being obedient to ourhusbands, though they be dogs;&rdquo; and with this she began to weep inearnest, as if she already saw Sanchica dead and buried.</p><p>Sancho consoled her by saying that though he must make her a countess, hewould put it off as long as possible.

Nevertheless, among manyother representations made to him, the housekeeper said to him, &ldquo;Intruth, master, if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home, and giveover roaming mountains and valleys like a troubled spirit, looking forwhat they say are called adventures, but what I call misfortunes, I shallhave to make complaint to God and the king with loud supplication to sendsome remedy.&rdquo;</p><p>To which Don Quixote replied, &ldquo;What answer God will give to yourcomplaints, housekeeper, I know not, nor what his Majesty will answereither; I only know that if I were king I should decline to answer thenumberless silly petitions they present every day; for one of the greatestamong the many troubles kings have is being obliged to listen to all andanswer all, and therefore I should be sorry that any affairs of mineshould worry him.&rdquo;</p><p>Whereupon the housekeeper said, &ldquo;Tell us, señor, at his Majesty&rsquo;scourt are there no knights?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;and plenty of them;and it is right there should be, to set off the dignity of the prince, andfor the greater glory of the king&rsquo;s majesty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then might not your worship,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;be one ofthose that, without stirring a step, serve their king and lord in hiscourt?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Recollect, my friend,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;all knightscannot be courtiers, nor can all courtiers be knights-errant, nor needthey be. There must be all sorts in the world; and though we may be allknights, there is a great difference between one and another; for thecourtiers, without quitting their chambers, or the threshold of the court,range the world over by looking at a map, without its costing them afarthing, and without suffering heat or cold, hunger or thirst; but we,the true knights-errant, measure the whole earth with our own feet,exposed to the sun, to the cold, to the air, to the inclemencies ofheaven, by day and night, on foot and on horseback; nor do we only knowenemies in pictures, but in their own real shapes; and at all risks and onall occasions we attack them, without any regard to childish points orrules of single combat, whether one has or has not a shorter lance orsword, whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him,whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out, and otherniceties of the sort that are observed in set combats of man to man, thatyou know nothing about, but I do. And you must know besides, that the trueknight-errant, though he may see ten giants, that not only touch theclouds with their heads but pierce them, and that go, each of them, on twotall towers by way of legs, and whose arms are like the masts of mightyships, and each eye like a great mill-wheel, and glowing brighter than aglass furnace, must not on any account be dismayed by them. On thecontrary, he must attack and fall upon them with a gallant bearing and afearless heart, and, if possible, vanquish and destroy them, even thoughthey have for armour the shells of a certain fish, that they say areharder than diamonds, and in place of swords wield trenchant blades ofDamascus steel, or clubs studded with spikes also of steel, such as I havemore than once seen. All this I say, housekeeper, that you may see thedifference there is between the one sort of knight and the other; and itwould be well if there were no prince who did not set a higher value onthis second, or more properly speaking first, kind of knights-errant; for,as we read in their histories, there have been some among them who havebeen the salvation, not merely of one kingdom, but of many.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, señor,&rdquo; here exclaimed the niece, &ldquo;remember thatall this you are saying about knights-errant is fable and fiction; andtheir histories, if indeed they were not burned, would deserve, each ofthem, to have a sambenito put on it, or some mark by which it might beknown as infamous and a corrupter of good manners.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By the God that gives me life,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;ifthou wert not my full niece, being daughter of my own sister, I wouldinflict a chastisement upon thee for the blasphemy thou hast uttered thatall the world should ring with. What! can it be that a young hussy thathardly knows how to handle a dozen lace-bobbins dares to wag her tongueand criticise the histories of knights-errant? What would Señor Amadis sayif he heard of such a thing? He, however, no doubt would forgive thee, forhe was the most humble-minded and courteous knight of his time, andmoreover a great protector of damsels; but some there are that might haveheard thee, and it would not have been well for thee in that case; forthey are not all courteous or mannerly; some are ill-conditionedscoundrels; nor is it everyone that calls himself a gentleman, that is soin all respects; some are gold, others pinchbeck, and all look likegentlemen, but not all can stand the touchstone of truth. There are men oflow rank who strain themselves to bursting to pass for gentlemen, and highgentlemen who, one would fancy, were dying to pass for men of low rank;the former raise themselves by their ambition or by their virtues, thelatter debase themselves by their lack of spirit or by their vices; andone has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kindsof gentlemen, so much alike in name and so different in conduct.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God bless me!&rdquo; said the niece, &ldquo;that you should know somuch, uncle&mdash;enough, if need be, to get up into a pulpit and gopreach in the streets&mdash;and yet that you should fall into a delusionso great and a folly so manifest as to try to make yourself out vigorouswhen you are old, strong when you are sickly, able to put straight what iscrooked when you yourself are bent by age, and, above all, a caballerowhen you are not one; for though gentlefolk may be so, poor men arenothing of the kind!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is a great deal of truth in what you say, niece,&rdquo;returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;and I could tell you somewhat about birththat would astonish you; but, not to mix up things human and divine, Irefrain. Look you, my dears, all the lineages in the world (attend to whatI am saying) can be reduced to four sorts, which are these: those that hadhumble beginnings, and went on spreading and extending themselves untilthey attained surpassing greatness; those that had great beginnings andmaintained them, and still maintain and uphold the greatness of theirorigin; those, again, that from a great beginning have ended in a pointlike a pyramid, having reduced and lessened their original greatness tillit has come to nought, like the point of a pyramid, which, relatively toits base or foundation, is nothing; and then there are those&mdash;and itis they that are the most numerous&mdash;that have had neither anillustrious beginning nor a remarkable mid-course, and so will have an endwithout a name, like an ordinary plebeian line. Of the first, those thathad an humble origin and rose to the greatness they still preserve, theOttoman house may serve as an example, which from an humble and lowlyshepherd, its founder, has reached the height at which we now see it. Forexamples of the second sort of lineage, that began with greatness andmaintains it still without adding to it, there are the many princes whohave inherited the dignity, and maintain themselves in their inheritance,without increasing or diminishing it, keeping peacefully within the limitsof their states. Of those that began great and ended in a point, there arethousands of examples, for all the Pharaohs and Ptolemies of Egypt, theCæsars of Rome, and the whole herd (if I may apply such a word to them)of countless princes, monarchs, lords, Medes, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks,and barbarians, all these lineages and lordships have ended in a point andcome to nothing, they themselves as well as their founders, for it wouldbe impossible now to find one of their descendants, and, even should wefind one, it would be in some lowly and humble condition. Of plebeianlineages I have nothing to say, save that they merely serve to swell thenumber of those that live, without any eminence to entitle them to anyfame or praise beyond this. From all I have said I would have you gather,my poor innocents, that great is the confusion among lineages, and thatonly those are seen to be great and illustrious that show themselves so bythe virtue, wealth, and generosity of their possessors. I have saidvirtue, wealth, and generosity, because a great man who is vicious will bea great example of vice, and a rich man who is not generous will be merelya miserly beggar; for the possessor of wealth is not made happy bypossessing it, but by spending it, and not by spending as he pleases, butby knowing how to spend it well. The poor gentleman has no way of showingthat he is a gentleman but by virtue, by being affable, well-bred,courteous, gentle-mannered, and kindly, not haughty, arrogant, orcensorious, but above all by being charitable; for by two maravedis givenwith a cheerful heart to the poor, he will show himself as generous as hewho distributes alms with bell-ringing, and no one that perceives him tobe endowed with the virtues I have named, even though he know him not,will fail to recognise and set him down as one of good blood; and it wouldbe strange were it not so; praise has ever been the reward of virtue, andthose who are virtuous cannot fail to receive commendation. There are tworoads, my daughters, by which men may reach wealth and honours; one isthat of letters, the other that of arms. I have more of arms than ofletters in my composition, and, judging by my inclination to arms, wasborn under the influence of the planet Mars. I am, therefore, in a measureconstrained to follow that road, and by it I must travel in spite of allthe world, and it will be labour in vain for you to urge me to resist whatheaven wills, fate ordains, reason requires, and, above all, my owninclination favours; for knowing as I do the countless toils that are theaccompaniments of knight-errantry, I know, too, the infinite blessingsthat are attained by it; I know that the path of virtue is very narrow,and the road of vice broad and spacious; I know their ends and goals aredifferent, for the broad and easy road of vice ends in death, and thenarrow and toilsome one of virtue in life, and not transitory life, but inthat which has no end; I know, as our great Castilian poet says, that-</p><p class="poem">It is by rugged paths like these they go<br/>That scale the heights of immortality,<br/>Unreached by those that falter here below.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Woe is me!&rdquo; exclaimed the niece, &ldquo;my lord is a poet,too! He knows everything, and he can do everything; I will bet, if hechose to turn mason, he could make a house as easily as a cage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can tell you, niece,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;if thesechivalrous thoughts did not engage all my faculties, there would benothing that I could not do, nor any sort of knickknack that would notcome from my hands, particularly cages and tooth-picks.&rdquo;</p><p>At this moment there came a knocking at the door, and when they asked whowas there, Sancho Panza made answer that it was he. The instant thehousekeeper knew who it was, she ran to hide herself so as not to see him;in such abhorrence did she hold him. The niece let him in, and his masterDon Quixote came forward to receive him with open arms, and the pair shutthemselves up in his room, where they had another conversation notinferior to the previous one.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p06e" id="p06e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p06e.jpg (19K)" src="images/p06e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch7b" id="ch7b"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br/>OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE, TOGETHER WITH OTHERVERY NOTABLE INCIDENTS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p07a" id="p07a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p07a.jpg (140K)" src="images/p07a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p07a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The instant the housekeeper saw Sancho Panza shut himself in with hermaster, she guessed what they were about; and suspecting that the resultof the consultation would be a resolve to undertake a third sally, sheseized her mantle, and in deep anxiety and distress, ran to find thebachelor Samson Carrasco, as she thought that, being a well-spoken man,and a new friend of her master&rsquo;s, he might be able to persuade himto give up any such crazy notion. She found him pacing the patio of hishouse, and, perspiring and flurried, she fell at his feet the moment shesaw him.</p><p>Carrasco, seeing how distressed and overcome she was, said to her, &ldquo;Whatis this, mistress housekeeper? What has happened to you? One would thinkyou heart-broken.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, Señor Samson,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;only that my masteris breaking out, plainly breaking out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whereabouts is he breaking out, señora?&rdquo; asked Samson;&ldquo;has any part of his body burst?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is only breaking out at the door of his madness,&rdquo; shereplied; &ldquo;I mean, dear señor bachelor, that he is going to break outagain (and this will be the third time) to hunt all over the world forwhat he calls ventures, though I can&rsquo;t make out why he gives themthat name. The first time he was brought back to us slung across the backof an ass, and belaboured all over; and the second time he came in anox-cart, shut up in a cage, in which he persuaded himself he wasenchanted, and the poor creature was in such a state that the mother thatbore him would not have known him; lean, yellow, with his eyes sunk deepin the cells of his skull; so that to bring him round again, ever solittle, cost me more than six hundred eggs, as God knows, and all theworld, and my hens too, that won&rsquo;t let me tell a lie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I can well believe,&rdquo; replied the bachelor, &ldquo;forthey are so good and so fat, and so well-bred, that they would not say onething for another, though they were to burst for it. In short then,mistress housekeeper, that is all, and there is nothing the matter, exceptwhat it is feared Don Quixote may do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, señor,&rdquo; said she.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; returned the bachelor, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t beuneasy, but go home in peace; get me ready something hot for breakfast,and while you are on the way say the prayer of Santa Apollonia, that is ifyou know it; for I will come presently and you will see miracles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Woe is me,&rdquo; cried the housekeeper, &ldquo;is it the prayer ofSanta Apollonia you would have me say? That would do if it was thetoothache my master had; but it is in the brains, what he has got.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know what I am saying, mistress housekeeper; go, and don&rsquo;tset yourself to argue with me, for you know I am a bachelor of Salamanca,and one can&rsquo;t be more of a bachelor than that,&rdquo; repliedCarrasco; and with this the housekeeper retired, and the bachelor went tolook for the curate, and arrange with him what will be told in its properplace.</p><p>While Don Quixote and Sancho were shut up together, they had a discussionwhich the history records with great precision and scrupulous exactness.Sancho said to his master, &ldquo;Señor, I have educed my wife to let mego with your worship wherever you choose to take me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Induced, you should say, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;noteduced.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Once or twice, as well as I remember,&rdquo; replied Sancho,&ldquo;I have begged of your worship not to mend my words, if so be as youunderstand what I mean by them; and if you don&rsquo;t understand them tosay &lsquo;Sancho,&rsquo; or &lsquo;devil,&rsquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;tunderstand thee; and if I don&rsquo;t make my meaning plain, then you maycorrect me, for I am so focile&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand thee, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote atonce; &ldquo;for I know not what &lsquo;I am so focile&rsquo; means.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So focile&rsquo; means I am so much that way,&rdquo; repliedSancho.</p><p>&ldquo;I understand thee still less now,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you can&rsquo;t understand me,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;Idon&rsquo;t know how to put it; I know no more, God help me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, now I have hit it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;thou wouldstsay thou art so docile, tractable, and gentle that thou wilt take what Isay to thee, and submit to what I teach thee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would bet,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that from the very firstyou understood me, and knew what I meant, but you wanted to put me outthat you might hear me make another couple of dozen blunders.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May be so,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;but to come to thepoint, what does Teresa say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Teresa says,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;that I should make surewith your worship, and &lsquo;let papers speak and beards be still,&rsquo;for &lsquo;he who binds does not wrangle,&rsquo; since one &lsquo;take&rsquo;is better than two &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give thee&rsquo;s;&rsquo; and I say awoman&rsquo;s advice is no great thing, and he who won&rsquo;t take it isa fool.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And so say I,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;continue, Sancho myfriend; go on; you talk pearls to-day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; continued Sancho, &ldquo;that, as your worshipknows better than I do, we are all of us liable to death, and to-day weare, and to-morrow we are not, and the lamb goes as soon as the sheep, andnobody can promise himself more hours of life in this world than God maybe pleased to give him; for death is deaf, and when it comes to knock atour life&rsquo;s door, it is always urgent, and neither prayers, norstruggles, nor sceptres, nor mitres, can keep it back, as common talk andreport say, and as they tell us from the pulpits every day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that is very true,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but I cannotmake out what thou art driving at.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What I am driving at,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;is that yourworship settle some fixed wages for me, to be paid monthly while I am inyour service, and that the same be paid me out of your estate; for I don&rsquo;tcare to stand on rewards which either come late, or ill, or never at all;God help me with my own. In short, I would like to know what I am to get,be it much or little; for the hen will lay on one egg, and many littlesmake a much, and so long as one gains something there is nothing lost. Tobe sure, if it should happen (what I neither believe nor expect) that yourworship were to give me that island you have promised me, I am not soungrateful nor so grasping but that I would be willing to have the revenueof such island valued and stopped out of my wages in due promotion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sancho, my friend,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;sometimesproportion may be as good as promotion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet I ought to havesaid proportion, and not promotion; but it is no matter, as your worshiphas understood me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And so well understood,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;that I haveseen into the depths of thy thoughts, and know the mark thou art shooting atwith the countless shafts of thy proverbs. Look here, Sancho, I would readilyfix thy wages if I had ever found any instance in the histories of theknights-errant to show or indicate, by the slightest hint, what their squiresused to get monthly or yearly; but I have read all or the best part of theirhistories, and I cannot remember reading of any knight-errant having assignedfixed wages to his squire; I only know that they all served on reward, and thatwhen they least expected it, if good luck attended their masters, they foundthemselves recompensed with an island or something equivalent to it, or at theleast they were left with a title and lordship. If with these hopes andadditional inducements you, Sancho, please to return to my service, well andgood; but to suppose that I am going to disturb or unhinge the ancient usage ofknight-errantry, is all nonsense. And so, my Sancho, get you back to your houseand explain my intentions to your Teresa, and if she likes and you like to beon reward with me, <i>bene quidem;</i> if not, we remain friends; for if thepigeon-house does not lack food, it will not lack pigeons; and bear in mind, myson, that a good hope is better than a bad holding, and a good grievance betterthan a bad compensation. I speak in this way, Sancho, to show you that I canshower down proverbs just as well as yourself; and in short, I mean to say, andI do say, that if you don&rsquo;t like to come on reward with me, and run thesame chance that I run, God be with you and make a saint of you; for I shallfind plenty of squires more obedient and painstaking, and not so thickheaded ortalkative as you are.&rdquo;</p><p>When Sancho heard his master&rsquo;s firm, resolute language, a cloud cameover the sky with him and the wings of his heart drooped, for he had madesure that his master would not go without him for all the wealth of theworld; and as he stood there dumbfoundered and moody, Samson Carrasco camein with the housekeeper and niece, who were anxious to hear by whatarguments he was about to dissuade their master from going to seekadventures. The arch wag Samson came forward, and embracing him as he haddone before, said with a loud voice, &ldquo;O flower of knight-errantry! Oshining light of arms! O honour and mirror of the Spanish nation! may GodAlmighty in his infinite power grant that any person or persons, who wouldimpede or hinder thy third sally, may find no way out of the labyrinth oftheir schemes, nor ever accomplish what they most desire!&rdquo; And then,turning to the housekeeper, he said, &ldquo;Mistress housekeeper may justas well give over saying the prayer of Santa Apollonia, for I know it isthe positive determination of the spheres that Señor Don Quixote shallproceed to put into execution his new and lofty designs; and I should laya heavy burden on my conscience did I not urge and persuade this knightnot to keep the might of his strong arm and the virtue of his valiantspirit any longer curbed and checked, for by his inactivity he isdefrauding the world of the redress of wrongs, of the protection oforphans, of the honour of virgins, of the aid of widows, and of thesupport of wives, and other matters of this kind appertaining, belonging,proper and peculiar to the order of knight-errantry. On, then, my lord DonQuixote, beautiful and brave, let your worship and highness set out to-dayrather than to-morrow; and if anything be needed for the execution of yourpurpose, here am I ready in person and purse to supply the want; and wereit requisite to attend your magnificence as squire, I should esteem it thehappiest good fortune.&rdquo;</p><p>At this, Don Quixote, turning to Sancho, said, &ldquo;Did I not tell thee,Sancho, there would be squires enough and to spare for me? See now whooffers to become one; no less than the illustrious bachelor SamsonCarrasco, the perpetual joy and delight of the courts of the Salamancanschools, sound in body, discreet, patient under heat or cold, hunger orthirst, with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight-errant&rsquo;ssquire! But heaven forbid that, to gratify my own inclination, I shouldshake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences, andcut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts. Let this newSamson remain in his own country, and, bringing honour to it, bring honourat the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents; for I will becontent with any squire that comes to hand, as Sancho does not deign toaccompany me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do deign,&rdquo; said Sancho, deeply moved and with tears in hiseyes; &ldquo;it shall not be said of me, master mine,&rdquo; he continued,&ldquo;&lsquo;the bread eaten and the company dispersed.&rsquo; Nay, Icome of no ungrateful stock, for all the world knows, but particularly myown town, who the Panzas from whom I am descended were; and, what is more,I know and have learned, by many good words and deeds, your worship&rsquo;sdesire to show me favour; and if I have been bargaining more or less aboutmy wages, it was only to please my wife, who, when she sets herself topress a point, no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she drives one todo what she wants; but, after all, a man must be a man, and a woman awoman; and as I am a man anyhow, which I can&rsquo;t deny, I will be onein my own house too, let who will take it amiss; and so there&rsquo;snothing more to do but for your worship to make your will with its codicilin such a way that it can&rsquo;t be provoked, and let us set out at once,to save Señor Samson&rsquo;s soul from suffering, as he says hisconscience obliges him to persuade your worship to sally out upon theworld a third time; so I offer again to serve your worship faithfully andloyally, as well and better than all the squires that servedknights-errant in times past or present.&rdquo;</p><p>The bachelor was filled with amazement when he heard Sancho&rsquo;sphraseology and style of talk, for though he had read the first part ofhis master&rsquo;s history he never thought that he could be so droll ashe was there described; but now, hearing him talk of a &ldquo;will andcodicil that could not be provoked,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;will andcodicil that could not be revoked,&rdquo; he believed all he had read ofhim, and set him down as one of the greatest simpletons of modern times;and he said to himself that two such lunatics as master and man the worldhad never seen. In fine, Don Quixote and Sancho embraced one another andmade friends, and by the advice and with the approval of the greatCarrasco, who was now their oracle, it was arranged that their departureshould take place three days thence, by which time they could have allthat was requisite for the journey ready, and procure a closed helmet,which Don Quixote said he must by all means take. Samson offered him one,as he knew a friend of his who had it would not refuse it to him, thoughit was more dingy with rust and mildew than bright and clean likeburnished steel.</p><p>The curses which both housekeeper and niece poured out on the bachelorwere past counting; they tore their hair, they clawed their faces, and inthe style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion, they raised alamentation over the departure of their master and uncle, as if it hadbeen his death. Samson&rsquo;s intention in persuading him to sally forthonce more was to do what the history relates farther on; all by the adviceof the curate and barber, with whom he had previously discussed thesubject. Finally, then, during those three days, Don Quixote and Sanchoprovided themselves with what they considered necessary, and Sancho havingpacified his wife, and Don Quixote his niece and housekeeper, atnightfall, unseen by anyone except the bachelor, who thought fit toaccompany them half a league out of the village, they set out for ElToboso, Don Quixote on his good Rocinante and Sancho on his old Dapple,his alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals, andhis purse with money that Don Quixote gave him to meet emergencies. Samsonembraced him, and entreated him to let him hear of his good or evilfortunes, so that he might rejoice over the former or condole with himover the latter, as the laws of friendship required. Don Quixote promisedhim he would do so, and Samson returned to the village, and the other twotook the road for the great city of El Toboso.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p07e" id="p07e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p07e.jpg (24K)" src="images/p07e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch8b" id="ch8b"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br/>WHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE ON HIS WAY TO SEE HIS LADYDULCINEA DEL TOBOSO</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p08a" id="p08a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p08a.jpg (65K)" src="images/p08a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p08a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Blessed be Allah the all-powerful!&rdquo; says Hamete Benengeli onbeginning this eighth chapter; &ldquo;blessed be Allah!&rdquo; he repeatsthree times; and he says he utters these thanksgivings at seeing that hehas now got Don Quixote and Sancho fairly afield, and that the readers ofhis delightful history may reckon that the achievements and humours of DonQuixote and his squire are now about to begin; and he urges them to forgetthe former chivalries of the ingenious gentleman and to fix their eyes onthose that are to come, which now begin on the road to El Toboso, as theothers began on the plains of Montiel; nor is it much that he asks inconsideration of all he promises, and so he goes on to say:</p><p>Don Quixote and Sancho were left alone, and the moment Samson took hisdeparture, Rocinante began to neigh, and Dapple to sigh, which, by bothknight and squire, was accepted as a good sign and a very happy omen;though, if the truth is to be told, the sighs and brays of Dapple werelouder than the neighings of the hack, from which Sancho inferred that hisgood fortune was to exceed and overtop that of his master, building,perhaps, upon some judicial astrology that he may have known, though thehistory says nothing about it; all that can be said is, that when hestumbled or fell, he was heard to say he wished he had not come out, forby stumbling or falling there was nothing to be got but a damaged shoe ora broken rib; and, fool as he was, he was not much astray in this.</p><p>Said Don Quixote, &ldquo;Sancho, my friend, night is drawing on upon us aswe go, and more darkly than will allow us to reach El Toboso by daylight;for there I am resolved to go before I engage in another adventure, andthere I shall obtain the blessing and generous permission of the peerlessDulcinea, with which permission I expect and feel assured that I shallconclude and bring to a happy termination every perilous adventure; fornothing in life makes knights-errant more valorous than finding themselvesfavoured by their ladies.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p08b" id="p08b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p08b.jpg (283K)" src="images/p08b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p08b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;So I believe,&rdquo; replied Sancho; &ldquo;but I think it will bedifficult for your worship to speak with her or see her, at any rate whereyou will be able to receive her blessing; unless, indeed, she throws itover the wall of the yard where I saw her the time before, when I took herthe letter that told of the follies and mad things your worship was doingin the heart of Sierra Morena.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Didst thou take that for a yard wall, Sancho,&rdquo; said DonQuixote, &ldquo;where or at which thou sawest that never sufficientlyextolled grace and beauty? It must have been the gallery, corridor, orportico of some rich and royal palace.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It might have been all that,&rdquo; returned Sancho, &ldquo;but tome it looked like a wall, unless I am short of memory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At all events, let us go there, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;for, so that I see her, it is the same to me whether it be over awall, or at a window, or through the chink of a door, or the grate of agarden; for any beam of the sun of her beauty that reaches my eyes willgive light to my reason and strength to my heart, so that I shall beunmatched and unequalled in wisdom and valour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, to tell the truth, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;when Isaw that sun of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, it was not bright enough tothrow out beams at all; it must have been, that as her grace was siftingthat wheat I told you of, the thick dust she raised came before her facelike a cloud and dimmed it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! dost thou still persist, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;in saying, thinking, believing, and maintaining that my ladyDulcinea was sifting wheat, that being an occupation and task entirely atvariance with what is and should be the employment of persons ofdistinction, who are constituted and reserved for other avocations andpursuits that show their rank a bowshot off? Thou hast forgotten, OSancho, those lines of our poet wherein he paints for us how, in theircrystal abodes, those four nymphs employed themselves who rose from theirloved Tagus and seated themselves in a verdant meadow to embroider thosetissues which the ingenious poet there describes to us, how they wereworked and woven with gold and silk and pearls; and something of this sortmust have been the employment of my lady when thou sawest her, only thatthe spite which some wicked enchanter seems to have against everything ofmine changes all those things that give me pleasure, and turns them intoshapes unlike their own; and so I fear that in that history of myachievements which they say is now in print, if haply its author was somesage who is an enemy of mine, he will have put one thing for another,mingling a thousand lies with one truth, and amusing himself by relatingtransactions which have nothing to do with the sequence of a true history.O envy, root of all countless evils, and cankerworm of the virtues! Allthe vices, Sancho, bring some kind of pleasure with them; but envy bringsnothing but irritation, bitterness, and rage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I say too,&rdquo; replied Sancho; &ldquo;and I suspect in thatlegend or history of us that the bachelor Samson Carrasco told us he saw,my honour goes dragged in the dirt, knocked about, up and down, sweepingthe streets, as they say. And yet, on the faith of an honest man, I neverspoke ill of any enchanter, and I am not so well off that I am to beenvied; to be sure, I am rather sly, and I have a certain spice of therogue in me; but all is covered by the great cloak of my simplicity,always natural and never acted; and if I had no other merit save that Ibelieve, as I always do, firmly and truly in God, and all the holy RomanCatholic Church holds and believes, and that I am a mortal enemy of theJews, the historians ought to have mercy on me and treat me well in theirwritings. But let them say what they like; naked was I born, naked I findmyself, I neither lose nor gain; nay, while I see myself put into a bookand passed on from hand to hand over the world, I don&rsquo;t care a fig,let them say what they like of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That, Sancho,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;reminds me ofwhat happened to a famous poet of our own day, who, having written abitter satire against all the courtesan ladies, did not insert or name init a certain lady of whom it was questionable whether she was one or not.She, seeing she was not in the list of the poet, asked him what he hadseen in her that he did not include her in the number of the others,telling him he must add to his satire and put her in the new part, or elselook out for the consequences. The poet did as she bade him, and left herwithout a shred of reputation, and she was satisfied by getting famethough it was infamy. In keeping with this is what they relate of thatshepherd who set fire to the famous temple of Diana, by repute one of theseven wonders of the world, and burned it with the sole object of makinghis name live in after ages; and, though it was forbidden to name him, ormention his name by word of mouth or in writing, lest the object of hisambition should be attained, nevertheless it became known that he wascalled Erostratus. And something of the same sort is what happened in thecase of the great emperor Charles V. and a gentleman in Rome. The emperorwas anxious to see that famous temple of the Rotunda, called in ancienttimes the temple &lsquo;of all the gods,&rsquo; but now-a-days, by abetter nomenclature, &lsquo;of all the saints,&rsquo; which is the bestpreserved building of all those of pagan construction in Rome, and the onewhich best sustains the reputation of mighty works and magnificence of itsfounders. It is in the form of a half orange, of enormous dimensions, andwell lighted, though no light penetrates it save that which is admitted bya window, or rather round skylight, at the top; and it was from this thatthe emperor examined the building. A Roman gentleman stood by his side andexplained to him the skilful construction and ingenuity of the vast fabricand its wonderful architecture, and when they had left the skylight hesaid to the emperor, &lsquo;A thousand times, your Sacred Majesty, theimpulse came upon me to seize your Majesty in my arms and fling myselfdown from yonder skylight, so as to leave behind me in the world a namethat would last for ever.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am thankful to you for notcarrying such an evil thought into effect,&rsquo; said the emperor,&lsquo;and I shall give you no opportunity in future of again putting yourloyalty to the test; and I therefore forbid you ever to speak to me or tobe where I am; and he followed up these words by bestowing a liberalbounty upon him. My meaning is, Sancho, that the desire of acquiring fameis a very powerful motive. What, thinkest thou, was it that flung Horatiusin full armour down from the bridge into the depths of the Tiber? Whatburned the hand and arm of Mutius? What impelled Curtius to plunge intothe deep burning gulf that opened in the midst of Rome? What, inopposition to all the omens that declared against him, made Julius Cæsarcross the Rubicon? And to come to more modern examples, what scuttled theships, and left stranded and cut off the gallant Spaniards under thecommand of the most courteous Cortés in the New World? All these and avariety of other great exploits are, were and will be, the work of famethat mortals desire as a reward and a portion of the immortality theirfamous deeds deserve; though we Catholic Christians and knights-errantlook more to that future glory that is everlasting in the ethereal regionsof heaven than to the vanity of the fame that is to be acquired in thispresent transitory life; a fame that, however long it may last, must afterall end with the world itself, which has its own appointed end. So that, OSancho, in what we do we must not overpass the bounds which the Christianreligion we profess has assigned to us. We have to slay pride in giants,envy by generosity and nobleness of heart, anger by calmness of demeanourand equanimity, gluttony and sloth by the spareness of our diet and thelength of our vigils, lust and lewdness by the loyalty we preserve tothose whom we have made the mistresses of our thoughts, indolence bytraversing the world in all directions seeking opportunities of makingourselves, besides Christians, famous knights. Such, Sancho, are the meansby which we reach those extremes of praise that fair fame carries with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that your worship has said so far,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;Ihave understood quite well; but still I would be glad if your worshipwould dissolve a doubt for me, which has just this minute come into mymind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Solve, thou meanest, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;sayon, in God&rsquo;s name, and I will answer as well as I can.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, señor,&rdquo; Sancho went on to say, &ldquo;those Julys orAugusts, and all those venturous knights that you say are now dead&mdash;whereare they now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The heathens,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;are, no doubt, inhell; the Christians, if they were good Christians, are either inpurgatory or in heaven.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;but now I want to know&mdash;thetombs where the bodies of those great lords are, have they silver lampsbefore them, or are the walls of their chapels ornamented with crutches,winding-sheets, tresses of hair, legs and eyes in wax? Or what are theyornamented with?&rdquo;</p><p>To which Don Quixote made answer: &ldquo;The tombs of the heathens weregenerally sumptuous temples; the ashes of Julius Cæsar&rsquo;s body were placedon the top of a stone pyramid of vast size, which they now call in Rome SaintPeter&rsquo;s needle. The emperor Hadrian had for a tomb a castle as large as agood-sized village, which they called the <i>Moles Adriani</i>, and is now thecastle of St. Angelo in Rome. The queen Artemisia buried her husband Mausolusin a tomb which was reckoned one of the seven wonders of the world; but none ofthese tombs, or of the many others of the heathens, were ornamented withwinding-sheets or any of those other offerings and tokens that show that theywho are buried there are saints.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point I&rsquo;m coming to,&rdquo; said Sancho;&ldquo;and now tell me, which is the greater work, to bring a dead man tolife or to kill a giant?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The answer is easy,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;it is agreater work to bring to life a dead man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now I have got you,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;in that case thefame of them who bring the dead to life, who give sight to the blind, curecripples, restore health to the sick, and before whose tombs there arelamps burning, and whose chapels are filled with devout folk on theirknees adoring their relics be a better fame in this life and in the otherthan that which all the heathen emperors and knights-errant that have everbeen in the world have left or may leave behind them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I grant, too,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Then this fame, these favours, these privileges, or whatever youcall it,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;belong to the bodies and relics of thesaints who, with the approbation and permission of our holy mother Church,have lamps, tapers, winding-sheets, crutches, pictures, eyes and legs, bymeans of which they increase devotion and add to their own Christianreputation. Kings carry the bodies or relics of saints on their shoulders,and kiss bits of their bones, and enrich and adorn their oratories andfavourite altars with them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What wouldst thou have me infer from all thou hast said, Sancho?&rdquo;asked Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;My meaning is,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;let us set about becomingsaints, and we shall obtain more quickly the fair fame we are strivingafter; for you know, señor, yesterday or the day before yesterday (for itis so lately one may say so) they canonised and beatified two littlebarefoot friars, and it is now reckoned the greatest good luck to kiss ortouch the iron chains with which they girt and tortured their bodies, andthey are held in greater veneration, so it is said, than the sword ofRoland in the armoury of our lord the King, whom God preserve. So that,señor, it is better to be an humble little friar of no matter what order,than a valiant knight-errant; with God a couple of dozen of penancelashings are of more avail than two thousand lance-thrusts, be they givento giants, or monsters, or dragons.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that is true,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;but we cannotall be friars, and many are the ways by which God takes his own to heaven;chivalry is a religion, there are sainted knights in glory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but I have heard say that there aremore friars in heaven than knights-errant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;is because those in religiousorders are more numerous than knights.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The errants are many,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Many,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;but few they who deservethe name of knights.&rdquo;</p><p>With these, and other discussions of the same sort, they passed that nightand the following day, without anything worth mention happening to them,whereat Don Quixote was not a little dejected; but at length the next day,at daybreak, they descried the great city of El Toboso, at the sight ofwhich Don Quixote&rsquo;s spirits rose and Sancho&rsquo;s fell, for he didnot know Dulcinea&rsquo;s house, nor in all his life had he ever seen her,any more than his master; so that they were both uneasy, the one to seeher, the other at not having seen her, and Sancho was at a loss to knowwhat he was to do when his master sent him to El Toboso. In the end, DonQuixote made up his mind to enter the city at nightfall, and they waiteduntil the time came among some oak trees that were near El Toboso; andwhen the moment they had agreed upon arrived, they made their entranceinto the city, where something happened them that may fairly be calledsomething.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p08e" id="p08e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p08e.jpg (49K)" src="images/p08e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p08e.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch9b" id="ch9b"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br/>WHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT WILL BE SEEN THERE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p09a" id="p09a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p09a.jpg (79K)" src="images/p09a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p09a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&rsquo;Twas at the very midnight hour&mdash;more or less&mdash;when DonQuixote and Sancho quitted the wood and entered El Toboso. The town was indeep silence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on thebroad of their backs, as the saying is. The night was darkish, thoughSancho would have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find in thedarkness an excuse for his blundering. All over the place nothing was tobe heard except the barking of dogs, which deafened the ears of DonQuixote and troubled the heart of Sancho. Now and then an ass brayed, pigsgrunted, cats mewed, and the various noises they made seemed louder in thesilence of the night; all which the enamoured knight took to be of evilomen; nevertheless he said to Sancho, &ldquo;Sancho, my son, lead on tothe palace of Dulcinea, it may be that we shall find her awake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Body of the sun! what palace am I to lead to,&rdquo; said Sancho,&ldquo;when what I saw her highness in was only a very little house?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Most likely she had then withdrawn into some small apartment of herpalace,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;to amuse herself with damsels, asgreat ladies and princesses are accustomed to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;if your worship will have it inspite of me that the house of my lady Dulcinea is a palace, is this anhour, think you, to find the door open; and will it be right for us to goknocking till they hear us and open the door; making a disturbance andconfusion all through the household? Are we going, do you fancy, to thehouse of our wenches, like gallants who come and knock and go in at anyhour, however late it may be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us first of all find out the palace for certain,&rdquo; repliedDon Quixote, &ldquo;and then I will tell thee, Sancho, what we had bestdo; but look, Sancho, for either I see badly, or that dark mass that onesees from here should be Dulcinea&rsquo;s palace.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then let your worship lead the way,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;perhapsit may be so; though I see it with my eyes and touch it with my hands, I&rsquo;llbelieve it as much as I believe it is daylight now.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote took the lead, and having gone a matter of two hundred paceshe came upon the mass that produced the shade, and found it was a greattower, and then he perceived that the building in question was no palace,but the chief church of the town, and said he, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s thechurch we have lit upon, Sancho.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and God grant we may not lightupon our graves; it is no good sign to find oneself wandering in agraveyard at this time of night; and that, after my telling your worship,if I don&rsquo;t mistake, that the house of this lady will be in an alleywithout an outlet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The curse of God on thee for a blockhead!&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;where hast thou ever heard of castles and royal palaces being builtin alleys without an outlet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;every country has a way of itsown; perhaps here in El Toboso it is the way to build palaces and grandbuildings in alleys; so I entreat your worship to let me search aboutamong these streets or alleys before me, and perhaps, in some corner orother, I may stumble on this palace&mdash;and I wish I saw the dogs eatingit for leading us such a dance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Speak respectfully of what belongs to my lady, Sancho,&rdquo; saidDon Quixote; &ldquo;let us keep the feast in peace, and not throw the ropeafter the bucket.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold my tongue,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but how am Ito take it patiently when your worship wants me, with only once seeing thehouse of our mistress, to know always, and find it in the middle of thenight, when your worship can&rsquo;t find it, who must have seen itthousands of times?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou wilt drive me to desperation, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.&ldquo;Look here, heretic, have I not told thee a thousand times that Ihave never once in my life seen the peerless Dulcinea or crossed thethreshold of her palace, and that I am enamoured solely by hearsay and bythe great reputation she bears for beauty and discretion?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I hear it now,&rdquo; returned Sancho; &ldquo;and I may tell youthat if you have not seen her, no more have I.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That cannot be,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for, at any rate,thou saidst, on bringing back the answer to the letter I sent by thee,that thou sawest her sifting wheat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind that, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I musttell you that my seeing her and the answer I brought you back were byhearsay too, for I can no more tell who the lady Dulcinea is than I canhit the sky.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sancho, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;there are times forjests and times when jests are out of place; if I tell thee that I haveneither seen nor spoken to the lady of my heart, it is no reason why thoushouldst say thou hast not spoken to her or seen her, when the contrary isthe case, as thou well knowest.&rdquo;</p><p>While the two were engaged in this conversation, they perceived someonewith a pair of mules approaching the spot where they stood, and from thenoise the plough made, as it dragged along the ground, they guessed him tobe some labourer who had got up before daybreak to go to his work, and soit proved to be. He came along singing the ballad that says-</p><p class="poem">Ill did ye fare, ye men of France,<br/>In Roncesvalles chase&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;May I die, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, when he heard him,&ldquo;if any good will come to us to-night!

He might just as well be singing the balladof Calainos, for any good or ill that can come to us in our business.&rdquo;</p><p>By this time the labourer had come up, and Don Quixote asked him, &ldquo;Canyou tell me, worthy friend, and God speed you, whereabouts here is thepalace of the peerless princess Doña Dulcinea del Toboso?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; replied the lad, &ldquo;I am a stranger, and I havebeen only a few days in the town, doing farm work for a rich farmer. Inthat house opposite there live the curate of the village and thesacristan, and both or either of them will be able to give your worshipsome account of this lady princess, for they have a list of all the peopleof El Toboso; though it is my belief there is not a princess living in thewhole of it; many ladies there are, of quality, and in her own house eachof them may be a princess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, she I am inquiring for will be one of these, my friend,&rdquo;said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;May be so,&rdquo; replied the lad; &ldquo;God be with you, for herecomes the daylight;&rdquo; and without waiting for any more of hisquestions, he whipped on his mules.</p><p>Sancho, seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied, said to him,&ldquo;Señor, daylight will be here before long, and it will not do for usto let the sun find us in the street; it will be better for us to quit thecity, and for your worship to hide in some forest in the neighbourhood,and I will come back in the daytime, and I won&rsquo;t leave a nook orcorner of the whole village that I won&rsquo;t search for the house,castle, or palace, of my lady, and it will be hard luck for me if I don&rsquo;tfind it; and as soon as I have found it I will speak to her grace, andtell her where and how your worship is waiting for her to arrange someplan for you to see her without any damage to her honour and reputation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;thou hast delivered athousand sentences condensed in the compass of a few words; I thank theefor the advice thou hast given me, and take it most gladly. Come, my son,let us go look for some place where I may hide, while thou dost return, asthou sayest, to seek, and speak with my lady, from whose discretion andcourtesy I look for favours more than miraculous.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho was in a fever to get his master out of the town, lest he shoulddiscover the falsehood of the reply he had brought to him in the SierraMorena on behalf of Dulcinea; so he hastened their departure, which theytook at once, and two miles out of the village they found a forest orthicket wherein Don Quixote ensconced himself, while Sancho returned tothe city to speak to Dulcinea, in which embassy things befell him whichdemand fresh attention and a new chapter.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p09e" id="p09e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p09e.jpg (34K)" src="images/p09e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch10b" id="ch10b"></a>CHAPTER X.<br/>WHEREIN IS RELATED THE CRAFTY DEVICE SANCHO ADOPTED TO ENCHANT THE LADYDULCINEA, AND OTHER INCIDENTS AS LUDICROUS AS THEY ARE TRUE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p10a" id="p10a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p10a.jpg (142K)" src="images/p10a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p10a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>When the author of this great history comes to relate what is set down inthis chapter he says he would have preferred to pass it over in silence,fearing it would not be believed, because here Don Quixote&rsquo;s madnessreaches the confines of the greatest that can be conceived, and even goesa couple of bowshots beyond the greatest. But after all, though stillunder the same fear and apprehension, he has recorded it without adding tothe story or leaving out a particle of the truth, and entirelydisregarding the charges of falsehood that might be brought against him;and he was right, for the truth may run fine but will not break, andalways rises above falsehood as oil above water; and so, going on with hisstory, he says that as soon as Don Quixote had ensconced himself in theforest, oak grove, or wood near El Toboso, he bade Sancho return to thecity, and not come into his presence again without having first spoken onhis behalf to his lady, and begged of her that it might be her goodpleasure to permit herself to be seen by her enslaved knight, and deign tobestow her blessing upon him, so that he might thereby hope for a happyissue in all his encounters and difficult enterprises. Sancho undertook toexecute the task according to the instructions, and to bring back ananswer as good as the one he brought back before.</p><p>&ldquo;Go, my son,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and be not dazed whenthou findest thyself exposed to the light of that sun of beauty thou artgoing to seek.

In short, my son, observe all her actions and motions, for ifthou wilt report them to me as they were, I will gather what she hides inthe recesses of her heart as regards my love; for I would have thee know,Sancho, if thou knowest it not, that with lovers the outward actions andmotions they give way to when their loves are in question are the faithfulmessengers that carry the news of what is going on in the depths of theirhearts. Go, my friend, may better fortune than mine attend thee, and bringthee a happier issue than that which I await in dread in this drearysolitude.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will go and return quickly,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;cheer upthat little heart of yours, master mine, for at the present moment youseem to have got one no bigger than a hazel nut; remember what they say,that a stout heart breaks bad luck, and that where there are no fletchesthere are no pegs; and moreover they say, the hare jumps up where it&rsquo;snot looked for. I say this because, if we could not find my lady&rsquo;spalaces or castles to-night, now that it is daylight I count upon findingthem when I least expect it, and once found, leave it to me to manage her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Verily, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;thou dost alwaysbring in thy proverbs happily, whatever we deal with; may God give mebetter luck in what I am anxious about.&rdquo;</p><p>With this, Sancho wheeled about and gave Dapple the stick, and Don Quixoteremained behind, seated on his horse, resting in his stirrups and leaningon the end of his lance, filled with sad and troubled forebodings; andthere we will leave him, and accompany Sancho, who went off no lessserious and troubled than he left his master; so much so, that as soon ashe had got out of the thicket, and looking round saw that Don Quixote wasnot within sight, he dismounted from his ass, and seating himself at thefoot of a tree began to commune with himself, saying, &ldquo;Now, brotherSancho, let us know where your worship is going. Are you going to look forsome ass that has been lost? Not at all. Then what are you going to lookfor? I am going to look for a princess, that&rsquo;s all; and in her forthe sun of beauty and the whole heaven at once. And where do you expect tofind all this, Sancho? Where? Why, in the great city of El Toboso. Well,and for whom are you going to look for her? For the famous knight DonQuixote of La Mancha, who rights wrongs, gives food to those who thirstand drink to the hungry. That&rsquo;s all very well, but do you know herhouse, Sancho? My master says it will be some royal palace or grandcastle. And have you ever seen her by any chance? Neither I nor my masterever saw her. And does it strike you that it would be just and right ifthe El Toboso people, finding out that you were here with the intention ofgoing to tamper with their princesses and trouble their ladies, were tocome and cudgel your ribs, and not leave a whole bone in you? They would,indeed, have very good reason, if they did not see that I am under orders,and that &lsquo;you are a messenger, my friend, no blame belongs to you.&rsquo;Don&rsquo;t you trust to that, Sancho, for the Manchegan folk are ashot-tempered as they are honest, and won&rsquo;t put up with libertiesfrom anybody. By the Lord, if they get scent of you, it will be worse foryou, I promise you. Be off, you scoundrel! Let the bolt fall. Why should Igo looking for three feet on a cat, to please another man; and what ismore, when looking for Dulcinea will be looking for Marica in Ravena, orthe bachelor in Salamanca? The devil, the devil and nobody else, has mixedme up in this business!&rdquo;</p><p>Such was the soliloquy Sancho held with himself, and all the conclusion hecould come to was to say to himself again, &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;sremedy for everything except death, under whose yoke we have all to pass,whether we like it or not, when life&rsquo;s finished. I have seen by athousand signs that this master of mine is a madman fit to be tied, andfor that matter, I too, am not behind him; for I&rsquo;m a greater foolthan he is when I follow him and serve him, if there&rsquo;s any truth inthe proverb that says, &lsquo;Tell me what company thou keepest, and I&rsquo;lltell thee what thou art,&rsquo; or in that other, &lsquo;Not with whomthou art bred, but with whom thou art fed.&rsquo; Well then, if he be mad,as he is, and with a madness that mostly takes one thing for another, andwhite for black, and black for white, as was seen when he said thewindmills were giants, and the monks&rsquo; mules dromedaries, flocks ofsheep armies of enemies, and much more to the same tune, it will not bevery hard to make him believe that some country girl, the first I comeacross here, is the lady Dulcinea; and if he does not believe it, I&rsquo;llswear it; and if he should swear, I&rsquo;ll swear again; and if hepersists I&rsquo;ll persist still more, so as, come what may, to have myquoit always over the peg. Maybe, by holding out in this way, I may put astop to his sending me on messages of this kind another time; or maybe hewill think, as I suspect he will, that one of those wicked enchanters, whohe says have a spite against him, has changed her form for the sake ofdoing him an ill turn and injuring him.&rdquo;</p><p>With this reflection Sancho made his mind easy, counting the business asgood as settled, and stayed there till the afternoon so as to make DonQuixote think he had time enough to go to El Toboso and return; and thingsturned out so luckily for him that as he got up to mount Dapple, he spied,coming from El Toboso towards the spot where he stood, three peasant girlson three colts, or fillies&mdash;for the author does not make the pointclear, though it is more likely they were she-asses, the usual mount withvillage girls; but as it is of no great consequence, we need not stop toprove it.</p><p>To be brief, the instant Sancho saw the peasant girls, he returned fullspeed to seek his master, and found him sighing and uttering a thousandpassionate lamentations. When Don Quixote saw him he exclaimed, &ldquo;Whatnews, Sancho, my friend? Am I to mark this day with a white stone or ablack?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your worship,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;had better mark it withruddle, like the inscriptions on the walls of class rooms, that those whosee it may see it plain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then thou bringest good news,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;So good,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;that your worship has onlyto spur Rocinante and get out into the open field to see the lady Dulcineadel Toboso, who, with two others, damsels of hers, is coming to see yourworship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Holy God! what art thou saying, Sancho, my friend?&rdquo; exclaimedDon Quixote. &ldquo;Take care thou art not deceiving me, or seeking byfalse joy to cheer my real sadness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What could I get by deceiving your worship,&rdquo; returned Sancho,&ldquo;especially when it will so soon be shown whether I tell the truthor not? Come, señor, push on, and you will see the princess our mistresscoming, robed and adorned&mdash;in fact, like what she is. Her damsels andshe are all one glow of gold, all bunches of pearls, all diamonds, allrubies, all cloth of brocade of more than ten borders; with their hairloose on their shoulders like so many sunbeams playing with the wind; andmoreover, they come mounted on three piebald cackneys, the finest sightever you saw.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hackneys, you mean, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;There is not much difference between cackneys and hackneys,&rdquo;said Sancho; &ldquo;but no matter what they come on, there they are, thefinest ladies one could wish for, especially my lady the princessDulcinea, who staggers one&rsquo;s senses.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us go, Sancho, my son,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and inguerdon of this news, as unexpected as it is good, I bestow upon thee thebest spoil I shall win in the first adventure I may have; or if that doesnot satisfy thee, I promise thee the foals I shall have this year from mythree mares that thou knowest are in foal on our village common.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the foals,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;for it is notquite certain that the spoils of the first adventure will be good ones.&rdquo;</p><p>By this time they had cleared the wood, and saw the three village lassesclose at hand. Don Quixote looked all along the road to El Toboso, and ashe could see nobody except the three peasant girls, he was completelypuzzled, and asked Sancho if it was outside the city he had left them.</p><p>&ldquo;How outside the city?&rdquo; returned Sancho. &ldquo;Are yourworship&rsquo;s eyes in the back of your head, that you can&rsquo;t seethat they are these who are coming here, shining like the very sun atnoonday?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I see nothing, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;but threecountry girls on three jackasses.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now, may God deliver me from the devil!&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;andcan it be that your worship takes three hackneys&mdash;or whatever they&rsquo;recalled&mdash;as white as the driven snow, for jackasses? By the Lord, Icould tear my beard if that was the case!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I can only say, Sancho, my friend,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;that it is as plain they are jackasses&mdash;or jennyasses&mdash;asthat I am Don Quixote, and thou Sancho Panza: at any rate, they seem to meto be so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hush, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk that way,but open your eyes, and come and pay your respects to the lady of yourthoughts, who is close upon us now;&rdquo; and with these words headvanced to receive the three village lasses, and dismounting from Dapple,caught hold of one of the asses of the three country girls by the halter,and dropping on both knees on the ground, he said, &ldquo;Queen andprincess and duchess of beauty, may it please your haughtiness andgreatness to receive into your favour and good-will your captive knightwho stands there turned into marble stone, and quite stupefied andbenumbed at finding himself in your magnificent presence. I am SanchoPanza, his squire, and he the vagabond knight Don Quixote of La Mancha,otherwise called &lsquo;The Knight of the Rueful Countenance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote had by this time placed himself on his knees beside Sancho,and, with eyes starting out of his head and a puzzled gaze, was regardingher whom Sancho called queen and lady; and as he could see nothing in herexcept a village lass, and not a very well-favoured one, for she wasplatter-faced and snub-nosed, he was perplexed and bewildered, and did notventure to open his lips. The country girls, at the same time, wereastonished to see these two men, so different in appearance, on theirknees, preventing their companion from going on. She, however, who hadbeen stopped, breaking silence, said angrily and testily, &ldquo;Get outof the way, bad luck to you, and let us pass, for we are in a hurry.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p10b" id="p10b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p10b.jpg (319K)" src="images/p10b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p10b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>To which Sancho returned, &ldquo;Oh, princess and universal lady of ElToboso, is not your magnanimous heart softened by seeing the pillar andprop of knight-errantry on his knees before your sublimated presence?&rdquo;</p><p>On hearing this, one of the others exclaimed, &ldquo;Woa then! why, I&rsquo;mrubbing thee down, she-ass of my father-in-law! See how the lordlings cometo make game of the village girls now, as if we here could not chaff aswell as themselves. Go your own way, and let us go ours, and it will bebetter for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get up, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote at this; &ldquo;I see thatfortune, &lsquo;with evil done to me unsated still,&rsquo; has takenpossession of all the roads by which any comfort may reach &lsquo;thiswretched soul&rsquo; that I carry in my flesh. And thou, highestperfection of excellence that can be desired, utmost limit of grace inhuman shape, sole relief of this afflicted heart that adores thee, thoughthe malign enchanter that persecutes me has brought clouds and cataractson my eyes, and to them, and them only, transformed thy unparagoned beautyand changed thy features into those of a poor peasant girl, if so be hehas not at the same time changed mine into those of some monster to renderthem loathsome in thy sight, refuse not to look upon me with tendernessand love; seeing in this submission that I make on my knees to thytransformed beauty the humility with which my soul adores thee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey-day! My grandfather!&rdquo; cried the girl, &ldquo;much I carefor your love-making! Get out of the way and let us pass, and we&rsquo;llthank you.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho stood aside and let her go, very well pleased to have got so wellout of the hobble he was in. The instant the village lass who had doneduty for Dulcinea found herself free, prodding her &ldquo;cackney&rdquo;with a spike she had at the end of a stick, she set off at full speedacross the field. The she-ass, however, feeling the point more acutelythan usual, began cutting such capers, that it flung the lady Dulcinea tothe ground; seeing which, Don Quixote ran to raise her up, and Sancho tofix and girth the pack-saddle, which also had slipped under the ass&rsquo;sbelly. The pack-saddle being secured, as Don Quixote was about to lift uphis enchanted mistress in his arms and put her upon her beast, the lady,getting up from the ground, saved him the trouble, for, going back alittle, she took a short run, and putting both hands on the croup of theass she dropped into the saddle more lightly than a falcon, and satastride like a man, whereat Sancho said, &ldquo;Rogue! but our lady islighter than a lanner, and might teach the cleverest Cordovan or Mexicanhow to mount; she cleared the back of the saddle in one jump, and withoutspurs she is making the hackney go like a zebra; and her damsels are noway behind her, for they all fly like the wind;&rdquo; which was thetruth, for as soon as they saw Dulcinea mounted, they pushed on after her,and sped away without looking back, for more than half a league.</p><p>Don Quixote followed them with his eyes, and when they were no longer insight, he turned to Sancho and said, &ldquo;How now, Sancho? thou seesthow I am hated by enchanters! And see to what a length the malice andspite they bear me go, when they seek to deprive me of the happiness itwould give me to see my lady in her own proper form. The fact is I wasborn to be an example of misfortune, and the target and mark at which thearrows of adversity are aimed and directed. Observe too, Sancho, thatthese traitors were not content with changing and transforming myDulcinea, but they transformed and changed her into a shape as mean andill-favoured as that of the village girl yonder; and at the same time theyrobbed her of that which is such a peculiar property of ladies ofdistinction, that is to say, the sweet fragrance that comes of beingalways among perfumes and flowers. For I must tell thee, Sancho, that whenI approached to put Dulcinea upon her hackney (as thou sayest it was,though to me it appeared a she-ass), she gave me a whiff of raw garlicthat made my head reel, and poisoned my very heart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O scum of the earth!&rdquo; cried Sancho at this, &ldquo;Omiserable, spiteful enchanters! O that I could see you all strung by thegills, like sardines on a twig! Ye know a great deal, ye can do a greatdeal, and ye do a great deal more. It ought to have been enough for you,ye scoundrels, to have changed the pearls of my lady&rsquo;s eyes into oakgalls, and her hair of purest gold into the bristles of a red ox&rsquo;stail, and in short, all her features from fair to foul, without meddlingwith her smell; for by that we might somehow have found out what washidden underneath that ugly rind; though, to tell the truth, I neverperceived her ugliness, but only her beauty, which was raised to thehighest pitch of perfection by a mole she had on her right lip, like amoustache, with seven or eight red hairs like threads of gold, and morethan a palm long.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From the correspondence which exists between those of the face andthose of the body,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;Dulcinea must haveanother mole resembling that on the thick of the thigh on that side onwhich she has the one on her face; but hairs of the length thou hastmentioned are very long for moles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say is there they were as plain as could be,&rdquo;replied Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe it, my friend,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote; &ldquo;fornature bestowed nothing on Dulcinea that was not perfect andwell-finished; and so, if she had a hundred moles like the one thou hastdescribed, in her they would not be moles, but moons and shining stars.But tell me, Sancho, that which seemed to me to be a pack-saddle as thouwert fixing it, was it a flat-saddle or a side-saddle?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was neither,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;but a jineta saddle,with a field covering worth half a kingdom, so rich is it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that I could not see all this, Sancho!&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;once more I say, and will say a thousand times, I am the mostunfortunate of men.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho, the rogue, had enough to do to hide his laughter, at hearing thesimplicity of the master he had so nicely befooled. At length, after agood deal more conversation had passed between them, they remounted theirbeasts, and followed the road to Saragossa, which they expected to reachin time to take part in a certain grand festival which is held every yearin that illustrious city; but before they got there things happened tothem, so many, so important, and so strange, that they deserve to berecorded and read, as will be seen farther on.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p10e" id="p10e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p10e.jpg (56K)" src="images/p10e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p10e.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch11b" id="ch11b"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br/>OF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE CAR ORCART OF &ldquo;THE CORTES OF DEATH&rdquo;</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p11a" id="p11a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p11a.jpg (172K)" src="images/p11a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p11a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Dejected beyond measure did Don Quixote pursue his journey, turning overin his mind the cruel trick the enchanters had played him in changing hislady Dulcinea into the vile shape of the village lass, nor could he thinkof any way of restoring her to her original form; and these reflections soabsorbed him, that without being aware of it he let go Rocinante&rsquo;sbridle, and he, perceiving the liberty that was granted him, stopped atevery step to crop the fresh grass with which the plain abounded.</p><p>Sancho recalled him from his reverie. &ldquo;Melancholy, señor,&rdquo;said he, &ldquo;was made, not for beasts, but for men; but if men give wayto it overmuch they turn to beasts; control yourself, your worship; beyourself again; gather up Rocinante&rsquo;s reins; cheer up, rouseyourself and show that gallant spirit that knights-errant ought to have.What the devil is this? What weakness is this? Are we here or in France?The devil fly away with all the Dulcineas in the world; for the well-beingof a single knight-errant is of more consequence than all the enchantmentsand transformations on earth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hush, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote in a weak and faint voice,&ldquo;hush and utter no blasphemies against that enchanted lady; for Ialone am to blame for her misfortune and hard fate; her calamity has comeof the hatred the wicked bear me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So say I,&rdquo; returned Sancho; &ldquo;his heart rend in twain, Itrow, who saw her once, to see her now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou mayest well say that, Sancho,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote,&ldquo;as thou sawest her in the full perfection of her beauty; for theenchantment does not go so far as to pervert thy vision or hide herloveliness from thee; against me alone and against my eyes is the strengthof its venom directed. Nevertheless, there is one thing which has occurredto me, and that is that thou didst ill describe her beauty to me, for, aswell as I recollect, thou saidst that her eyes were pearls; but eyes thatare like pearls are rather the eyes of a sea-bream than of a lady, and Iam persuaded that Dulcinea&rsquo;s must be green emeralds, full and soft,with two rainbows for eyebrows; take away those pearls from her eyes andtransfer them to her teeth; for beyond a doubt, Sancho, thou hast takenthe one for the other, the eyes for the teeth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;for her beauty bewilderedme as much as her ugliness did your worship; but let us leave it all toGod, who alone knows what is to happen in this vale of tears, in this evilworld of ours, where there is hardly a thing to be found without somemixture of wickedness, roguery, and rascality. But one thing, señor,troubles me more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to bedone when your worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, andorders him to go and present himself before the beauty of the ladyDulcinea. Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquishedknight, to find her? I think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso,looking like noddies, and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if theymeet her in the middle of the street they won&rsquo;t know her any morethan they would my father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Sancho,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;theenchantment does not go so far as to deprive conquered and presentedgiants and knights of the power of recognising Dulcinea; we will try byexperiment with one or two of the first I vanquish and send to her,whether they see her or not, by commanding them to return and give me anaccount of what happened to them in this respect.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,&rdquo;said Sancho; &ldquo;and that by this plan we shall find out what we wantto know; and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, themisfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcineais well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on aswell as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his owncourse; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by acart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages andfigures that could be imagined. He who led the mules and acted as carterwas a hideous demon; the cart was open to the sky, without a tilt or caneroof, and the first figure that presented itself to Don Quixote&rsquo;seyes was that of Death itself with a human face; next to it was an angelwith large painted wings, and at one side an emperor, with a crown, to allappearance of gold, on his head. At the feet of Death was the god calledCupid, without his bandage, but with his bow, quiver, and arrows; therewas also a knight in full armour, except that he had no morion or helmet,but only a hat decked with plumes of divers colours; and along with thesethere were others with a variety of costumes and faces. All this,unexpectedly encountered, took Don Quixote somewhat aback, and struckterror into the heart of Sancho; but the next instant Don Quixote was gladof it, believing that some new perilous adventure was presenting itself tohim, and under this impression, and with a spirit prepared to face anydanger, he planted himself in front of the cart, and in a loud andmenacing tone, exclaimed, &ldquo;Carter, or coachman, or devil, orwhatever thou art, tell me at once who thou art, whither thou art going,and who these folk are thou carriest in thy wagon, which looks more likeCharon&rsquo;s boat than an ordinary cart.&rdquo;</p><p>To which the devil, stopping the cart, answered quietly, &ldquo;Señor, weare players of Angulo el Malo&rsquo;s company; we have been acting theplay of &lsquo;The Cortés of Death&rsquo; this morning, which is theoctave of Corpus Christi, in a village behind that hill, and we have toact it this afternoon in that village which you can see from this; and asit is so near, and to save the trouble of undressing and dressing again,we go in the costumes in which we perform. That lad there appears asDeath, that other as an angel, that woman, the manager&rsquo;s wife, playsthe queen, this one the soldier, that the emperor, and I the devil; and Iam one of the principal characters of the play, for in this company I takethe leading parts. If you want to know anything more about us, ask me andI will answer with the utmost exactitude, for as I am a devil I am up toeverything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By the faith of a knight-errant,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote,&ldquo;when I saw this cart I fancied some great adventure was presentingitself to me; but I declare one must touch with the hand what appears tothe eye, if illusions are to be avoided. God speed you, good people; keepyour festival, and remember, if you demand of me ought wherein I canrender you a service, I will do it gladly and willingly, for from a childI was fond of the play, and in my youth a keen lover of the actor&rsquo;sart.&rdquo;</p><p>While they were talking, fate so willed it that one of the company in amummers&rsquo; dress with a great number of bells, and armed with threeblown ox-bladders at the end of a stick, joined them, and thismerry-andrew approaching Don Quixote, began flourishing his stick andbanging the ground with the bladders and cutting capers with greatjingling of the bells, which untoward apparition so startled Rocinantethat, in spite of Don Quixote&rsquo;s efforts to hold him in, taking thebit between his teeth he set off across the plain with greater speed thanthe bones of his anatomy ever gave any promise of.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p11b" id="p11b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p11b.jpg (327K)" src="images/p11b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p11b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Sancho, who thought his master was in danger of being thrown, jumped offDapple, and ran in all haste to help him; but by the time he reached himhe was already on the ground, and beside him was Rocinante, who had comedown with his master, the usual end and upshot of Rocinante&rsquo;svivacity and high spirits. But the moment Sancho quitted his beast to goand help Don Quixote, the dancing devil with the bladders jumped up onDapple, and beating him with them, more by the fright and the noise thanby the pain of the blows, made him fly across the fields towards thevillage where they were going to hold their festival. Sancho witnessedDapple&rsquo;s career and his master&rsquo;s fall, and did not know whichof the two cases of need he should attend to first; but in the end, like agood squire and good servant, he let his love for his master prevail overhis affection for his ass; though every time he saw the bladders rise inthe air and come down on the hind quarters of his Dapple he felt the painsand terrors of death, and he would have rather had the blows fall on theapples of his own eyes than on the least hair of his ass&rsquo;s tail. Inthis trouble and perplexity he came to where Don Quixote lay in a farsorrier plight than he liked, and having helped him to mount Rocinante, hesaid to him, &ldquo;Señor, the devil has carried off my Dapple.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What devil?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;The one with the bladders,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Then I will recover him,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;even if hebe shut up with him in the deepest and darkest dungeons of hell. Followme, Sancho, for the cart goes slowly, and with the mules of it I will makegood the loss of Dapple.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You need not take the trouble, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;keepcool, for as I now see, the devil has let Dapple go and he is coming backto his old quarters;&rdquo; and so it turned out, for, having come downwith Dapple, in imitation of Don Quixote and Rocinante, the devil made offon foot to the town, and the ass came back to his master.</p><p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;it will be well tovisit the discourtesy of that devil upon some of those in the cart, evenif it were the emperor himself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of it, your worship,&rdquo; returned Sancho;&ldquo;take my advice and never meddle with actors, for they are afavoured class; I myself have known an actor taken up for two murders, andyet come off scot-free; remember that, as they are merry folk who givepleasure, everyone favours and protects them, and helps and makes much ofthem, above all when they are those of the royal companies and underpatent, all or most of whom in dress and appearance look like princes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still, for all that,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;the playerdevil must not go off boasting, even if the whole human race favours him.&rdquo;</p><p>So saying, he made for the cart, which was now very near the town,shouting out as he went, &ldquo;Stay! halt! ye merry, jovial crew! I wantto teach you how to treat asses and animals that serve the squires ofknights-errant for steeds.&rdquo;</p><p>So loud were the shouts of Don Quixote, that those in the cart heard andunderstood them, and, guessing by the words what the speaker&rsquo;sintention was, Death in an instant jumped out of the cart, and theemperor, the devil carter and the angel after him, nor did the queen orthe god Cupid stay behind; and all armed themselves with stones and formedin line, prepared to receive Don Quixote on the points of their pebbles.Don Quixote, when he saw them drawn up in such a gallant array withuplifted arms ready for a mighty discharge of stones, checked Rocinanteand began to consider in what way he could attack them with the leastdanger to himself. As he halted Sancho came up, and seeing him disposed toattack this well-ordered squadron, said to him, &ldquo;It would be theheight of madness to attempt such an enterprise; remember, señor, thatagainst sops from the brook, and plenty of them, there is no defensivearmour in the world, except to stow oneself away under a brass bell; andbesides, one should remember that it is rashness, and not valour, for asingle man to attack an army that has Death in it, and where emperorsfight in person, with angels, good and bad, to help them; and if thisreflection will not make you keep quiet, perhaps it will to know forcertain that among all these, though they look like kings, princes, andemperors, there is not a single knight-errant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now indeed thou hast hit the point, Sancho,&rdquo; said DonQuixote, &ldquo;which may and should turn me from the resolution I hadalready formed. I cannot and must not draw sword, as I have many a timebefore told thee, against anyone who is not a dubbed knight; it is forthee, Sancho, if thou wilt, to take vengeance for the wrong done to thyDapple; and I will help thee from here by shouts and salutary counsels.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no occasion to take vengeance on anyone, señor,&rdquo;replied Sancho; &ldquo;for it is not the part of good Christians torevenge wrongs; and besides, I will arrange it with my ass to leave hisgrievance to my good-will and pleasure, and that is to live in peace aslong as heaven grants me life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;if that be thy determination,good Sancho, sensible Sancho, Christian Sancho, honest Sancho, let usleave these phantoms alone and turn to the pursuit of better and worthieradventures; for, from what I see of this country, we cannot fail to findplenty of marvellous ones in it.&rdquo;</p><p>He at once wheeled about, Sancho ran to take possession of his Dapple,Death and his flying squadron returned to their cart and pursued theirjourney, and thus the dread adventure of the cart of Death ended happily,thanks to the advice Sancho gave his master; who had, the following day, afresh adventure, of no less thrilling interest than the last, with anenamoured knight-errant.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p11e" id="p11e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p11e.jpg (20K)" src="images/p11e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch12b" id="ch12b"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br/>OF THE STRANGE ADVENTURE WHICH BEFELL THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE WITH THEBOLD KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p12a" id="p12a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p12a.jpg (98K)" src="images/p12a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p12a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The night succeeding the day of the encounter with Death, Don Quixote andhis squire passed under some tall shady trees, and Don Quixote at Sancho&rsquo;spersuasion ate a little from the store carried by Dapple, and over theirsupper Sancho said to his master, &ldquo;Señor, what a fool I should havelooked if I had chosen for my reward the spoils of the first adventureyour worship achieved, instead of the foals of the three mares.

Come, tell me, hast thou not seen a play actedin which kings, emperors, pontiffs, knights, ladies, and divers otherpersonages were introduced?

He did not remove Rocinante&rsquo;s saddle, ashis master&rsquo;s express orders were, that so long as they were in thefield or not sleeping under a roof Rocinante was not to be stripped&mdash;theancient usage established and observed by knights-errant being to take offthe bridle and hang it on the saddle-bow, but to remove the saddle fromthe horse&mdash;never! Sancho acted accordingly, and gave him the sameliberty he had given Dapple, between whom and Rocinante there was afriendship so unequalled and so strong, that it is handed down bytradition from father to son, that the author of this veracious historydevoted some special chapters to it, which, in order to preserve thepropriety and decorum due to a history so heroic, he did not inserttherein; although at times he forgets this resolution of his and describeshow eagerly the two beasts would scratch one another when they weretogether and how, when they were tired or full, Rocinante would lay hisneck across Dapple&rsquo;s, stretching half a yard or more on the otherside, and the pair would stand thus, gazing thoughtfully on the ground,for three days, or at least so long as they were left alone, or hunger didnot drive them to go and look for food. I may add that they say the authorleft it on record that he likened their friendship to that of Nisus andEuryalus, and Pylades and Orestes; and if that be so, it may be perceived,to the admiration of mankind, how firm the friendship must have beenbetween these two peaceful animals, shaming men, who preserve friendshipswith one another so badly.

Even so it would not be so bad if wehad something to eat, for woes are lighter if there&rsquo;s bread; butsometimes we go a day or two without breaking our fast, except with thewind that blows.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that,&rdquo; said he of the Grove, &ldquo;may be endured andput up with when we have hopes of reward; for, unless the knight-errant heserves is excessively unlucky, after a few turns the squire will at leastfind himself rewarded with a fine government of some island or some faircounty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;have already told my master that Ishall be content with the government of some island, and he is so nobleand generous that he has promised it to me ever so many times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said he of the Grove, &ldquo;shall be satisfied with acanonry for my services, and my master has already assigned me one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your master,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;no doubt is a knight in theChurch line, and can bestow rewards of that sort on his good squire; butmine is only a layman; though I remember some clever, but, to my mind,designing people, strove to persuade him to try and become an archbishop.He, however, would not be anything but an emperor; but I was trembling allthe time lest he should take a fancy to go into the Church, not findingmyself fit to hold office in it; for I may tell you, though I seem a man,I am no better than a beast for the Church.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, you are wrong there,&rdquo; said he of the Grove;&ldquo;for those island governments are not all satisfactory; some areawkward, some are poor, some are dull, and, in short, the highest andchoicest brings with it a heavy burden of cares and troubles which theunhappy wight to whose lot it has fallen bears upon his shoulders. Farbetter would it be for us who have adopted this accursed service to goback to our own houses, and there employ ourselves in pleasanteroccupations&mdash;in hunting or fishing, for instance; for what squire inthe world is there so poor as not to have a hack and a couple ofgreyhounds and a fishingrod to amuse himself with in his own village?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not in want of any of those things,&rdquo; said Sancho;&ldquo;to be sure I have no hack, but I have an ass that is worth mymaster&rsquo;s horse twice over; God send me a bad Easter, and that thenext one I am to see, if I would swap, even if I got four bushels ofbarley to boot. You will laugh at the value I put on my Dapple&mdash;fordapple is the colour of my beast. As to greyhounds, I can&rsquo;t want forthem, for there are enough and to spare in my town; and, moreover, thereis more pleasure in sport when it is at other people&rsquo;s expense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In truth and earnest, sir squire,&rdquo; said he of the Grove,&ldquo;I have made up my mind and determined to have done with thesedrunken vagaries of these knights, and go back to my village, and bring upmy children; for I have three, like three Oriental pearls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have two,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that might be presentedbefore the Pope himself, especially a girl whom I am breeding up for acountess, please God, though in spite of her mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how old is this lady that is being bred up for a countess?&rdquo;asked he of the Grove.</p><p>&ldquo;Fifteen, a couple of years more or less,&rdquo; answered Sancho;&ldquo;but she is as tall as a lance, and as fresh as an April morning,and as strong as a porter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Those are gifts to fit her to be not only a countess but a nymph ofthe greenwood,&rdquo; said he of the Grove; &ldquo;whoreson strumpet! whatpith the rogue must have!&rdquo;</p><p>To which Sancho made answer, somewhat sulkily, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s nostrumpet, nor was her mother, nor will either of them be, please God,while I live; speak more civilly; for one bred up among knights-errant,who are courtesy itself, your words don&rsquo;t seem to me to be verybecoming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O how little you know about compliments, sir squire,&rdquo;returned he of the Grove. &ldquo;What! don&rsquo;t you know that when ahorseman delivers a good lance thrust at the bull in the plaza, or whenanyone does anything very well, the people are wont to say, &lsquo;Ha,whoreson rip! how well he has done it!&rsquo; and that what seems to beabuse in the expression is high praise? Disown sons and daughters, señor,who don&rsquo;t do what deserves that compliments of this sort should bepaid to their parents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do disown them,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;and in this way,and by the same reasoning, you might call me and my children and my wifeall the strumpets in the world, for all they do and say is of a kind thatin the highest degree deserves the same praise; and to see them again Ipray God to deliver me from mortal sin, or, what comes to the same thing,to deliver me from this perilous calling of squire into which I havefallen a second time, decayed and beguiled by a purse with a hundredducats that I found one day in the heart of the Sierra Morena; and thedevil is always putting a bag full of doubloons before my eyes, here,there, everywhere, until I fancy at every stop I am putting my hand on it,and hugging it, and carrying it home with me, and making investments, andgetting interest, and living like a prince; and so long as I think of thisI make light of all the hardships I endure with this simpleton of a masterof mine, who, I well know, is more of a madman than a knight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s why they say that &lsquo;covetousness bursts the bag,&rsquo;&rdquo;said he of the Grove; &ldquo;but if you come to talk of that sort, thereis not a greater one in the world than my master, for he is one of thoseof whom they say, &lsquo;the cares of others kill the ass;&rsquo; for, inorder that another knight may recover the senses he has lost, he makes amadman of himself and goes looking for what, when found, may, for all Iknow, fly in his own face.&rdquo; &ldquo;And is he in love perchance?&rdquo;asked Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said of the Grove, &ldquo;with one Casildea deVandalia, the rawest and best roasted lady the whole world could produce;but that rawness is not the only foot he limps on, for he has greaterschemes rumbling in his bowels, as will be seen before many hours areover.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no road so smooth but it has some hole or hindrancein it,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;in other houses they cook beans, but inmine it&rsquo;s by the potful; madness will have more followers andhangers-on than sound sense; but if there be any truth in the commonsaying, that to have companions in trouble gives some relief, I may takeconsolation from you, inasmuch as you serve a master as crazy as my own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Crazy but valiant,&rdquo; replied he of the Grove, &ldquo;and moreroguish than crazy or valiant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mine is not that,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I mean he has nothingof the rogue in him; on the contrary, he has the soul of a pitcher; he hasno thought of doing harm to anyone, only good to all, nor has he anymalice whatever in him; a child might persuade him that it is night atnoonday; and for this simplicity I love him as the core of my heart, and Ican&rsquo;t bring myself to leave him, let him do ever such foolishthings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that, brother and señor,&rdquo; said he of the Grove,&ldquo;if the blind lead the blind, both are in danger of falling into thepit. It is better for us to beat a quiet retreat and get back to our ownquarters; for those who seek adventures don&rsquo;t always find good ones.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho kept spitting from time to time, and his spittle seemed somewhatropy and dry, observing which the compassionate squire of the Grove said,&ldquo;It seems to me that with all this talk of ours our tongues aresticking to the roofs of our mouths; but I have a pretty good loosenerhanging from the saddle-bow of my horse,&rdquo; and getting up he cameback the next minute with a large bota of wine and a pasty half a yardacross; and this is no exaggeration, for it was made of a house rabbit sobig that Sancho, as he handled it, took it to be made of a goat, not tosay a kid, and looking at it he said, &ldquo;And do you carry this withyou, señor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, what are you thinking about?&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;doyou take me for some paltry squire? I carry a better larder on my horse&rsquo;scroup than a general takes with him when he goes on a march.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho ate without requiring to be pressed, and in the dark boltedmouthfuls like the knots on a tether, and said he, &ldquo;You are a propertrusty squire, one of the right sort, sumptuous and grand, as this banquetshows, which, if it has not come here by magic art, at any rate has thelook of it; not like me, unlucky beggar, that have nothing more in myalforjas than a scrap of cheese, so hard that one might brain a giant withit, and, to keep it company, a few dozen carobs and as many more filbertsand walnuts; thanks to the austerity of my master, and the idea he has andthe rule he follows, that knights-errant must not live or sustainthemselves on anything except dried fruits and the herbs of the field.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By my faith, brother,&rdquo; said he of the Grove, &ldquo;mystomach is not made for thistles, or wild pears, or roots of the woods;let our masters do as they like, with their chivalry notions and laws, andeat what those enjoin; I carry my prog-basket and this bota hanging to thesaddle-bow, whatever they may say; and it is such an object of worshipwith me, and I love it so, that there is hardly a moment but I am kissingand embracing it over and over again;&rdquo; and so saying he thrust itinto Sancho&rsquo;s hands, who raising it aloft pointed to his mouth,gazed at the stars for a quarter of an hour; and when he had done drinkinglet his head fall on one side, and giving a deep sigh, exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah,whoreson rogue, how catholic it is!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There, you see,&rdquo; said he of the Grove, hearing Sancho&rsquo;sexclamation, &ldquo;how you have called this wine whoreson by way ofpraise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;I own it, and I grant it is nodishonour to call anyone whoreson when it is to be understood as praise.But tell me, señor, by what you love best, is this Ciudad Real wine?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O rare wine-taster!&rdquo; said he of the Grove; &ldquo;nowhereelse indeed does it come from, and it has some years&rsquo; age too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave me alone for that,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;never fear butI&rsquo;ll hit upon the place it came from somehow. What would you say,sir squire, to my having such a great natural instinct in judging winesthat you have only to let me smell one and I can tell positively itscountry, its kind, its flavour and soundness, the changes it will undergo,and everything that appertains to a wine? But it is no wonder, for I havehad in my family, on my father&rsquo;s side, the two best wine-tastersthat have been known in La Mancha for many a long year, and to prove it I&rsquo;lltell you now a thing that happened them. They gave the two of them somewine out of a cask, to try, asking their opinion as to the condition,quality, goodness or badness of the wine. One of them tried it with thetip of his tongue, the other did no more than bring it to his nose. Thefirst said the wine had a flavour of iron, the second said it had astronger flavour of cordovan. The owner said the cask was clean, and thatnothing had been added to the wine from which it could have got a flavourof either iron or leather. Nevertheless, these two great wine-tasters heldto what they had said.

I call her peerless because she has no peer, whether it be inbodily stature or in the supremacy of rank and beauty. This same Casildea,then, that I speak of, requited my honourable passion and gentleaspirations by compelling me, as his stepmother did Hercules, to engage inmany perils of various sorts, at the end of each promising me that, withthe end of the next, the object of my hopes should be attained; but mylabours have gone on increasing link by link until they are past counting,nor do I know what will be the last one that is to be the beginning of theaccomplishment of my chaste desires. On one occasion she bade me go andchallenge the famous giantess of Seville, La Giralda by name, who is asmighty and strong as if made of brass, and though never stirring from onespot, is the most restless and changeable woman in the world. I came, Isaw, I conquered, and I made her stay quiet and behave herself, fornothing but north winds blew for more than a week. Another time I wasordered to lift those ancient stones, the mighty bulls of Guisando, anenterprise that might more fitly be entrusted to porters than to knights.Again, she bade me fling myself into the cavern of Cabra&mdash;anunparalleled and awful peril&mdash;and bring her a minute account of allthat is concealed in those gloomy depths. I stopped the motion of theGiralda, I lifted the bulls of Guisando, I flung myself into the cavernand brought to light the secrets of its abyss; and my hopes are as dead asdead can be, and her scorn and her commands as lively as ever. To bebrief, last of all she has commanded me to go through all the provinces ofSpain and compel all the knights-errant wandering therein to confess thatshe surpasses all women alive to-day in beauty, and that I am the mostvaliant and the most deeply enamoured knight on earth; in support of whichclaim I have already travelled over the greater part of Spain, and havethere vanquished several knights who have dared to contradict me; but whatI most plume and pride myself upon is having vanquished in single combatthat so famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, and made him confess thatmy Casildea is more beautiful than his Dulcinea; and in this one victory Ihold myself to have conquered all the knights in the world; for this DonQuixote that I speak of has vanquished them all, and I having vanquishedhim, his glory, his fame, and his honour have passed and are transferredto my person; for</p><p class="poem">The more the vanquished hath of fair renown,<br/>The greater glory gilds the victor&rsquo;s crown.</p><p>Thus the innumerable achievements of the said Don Quixote are now set downto my account and have become mine.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote was amazed when he heard the Knight of the Grove, and was athousand times on the point of telling him he lied, and had the lie directalready on the tip of his tongue; but he restrained himself as well as hecould, in order to force him to confess the lie with his own lips; so hesaid to him quietly, &ldquo;As to what you say, sir knight, about havingvanquished most of the knights of Spain, or even of the whole world, I saynothing; but that you have vanquished Don Quixote of La Mancha I considerdoubtful; it may have been some other that resembled him, although thereare few like him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How! not vanquished?&rdquo; said he of the Grove; &ldquo;by theheaven that is above us I fought Don Quixote and overcame him and made himyield; and he is a man of tall stature, gaunt features, long, lank limbs,with hair turning grey, an aquiline nose rather hooked, and large blackdrooping moustaches; he does battle under the name of &lsquo;TheCountenance,&rsquo; and he has for squire a peasant called Sancho Panza;he presses the loins and rules the reins of a famous steed calledRocinante; and lastly, he has for the mistress of his will a certainDulcinea del Toboso, once upon a time called Aldonza Lorenzo, just as Icall mine Casildea de Vandalia because her name is Casilda and she is ofAndalusia. If all these tokens are not enough to vindicate the truth ofwhat I say, here is my sword, that will compel incredulity itself to givecredence to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, sir knight,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and giveear to what I am about to say to you. I would have you know that this DonQuixote you speak of is the greatest friend I have in the world; so muchso that I may say I regard him in the same light as my own person; andfrom the precise and clear indications you have given I cannot but thinkthat he must be the very one you have vanquished. On the other hand, I seewith my eyes and feel with my hands that it is impossible it can have beenthe same; unless indeed it be that, as he has many enemies who areenchanters, and one in particular who is always persecuting him, someoneof these may have taken his shape in order to allow himself to bevanquished, so as to defraud him of the fame that his exalted achievementsas a knight have earned and acquired for him throughout the known world.And in confirmation of this, I must tell you, too, that it is but tenhours since these said enchanters his enemies transformed the shape andperson of the fair Dulcinea del Toboso into a foul and mean village lass,and in the same way they must have transformed Don Quixote; and if allthis does not suffice to convince you of the truth of what I say, here isDon Quixote himself, who will maintain it by arms, on foot or on horsebackor in any way you please.&rdquo;</p><p>And so saying he stood up and laid his hand on his sword, waiting to seewhat the Knight of the Grove would do, who in an equally calm voice saidin reply, &ldquo;Pledges don&rsquo;t distress a good payer; he who hassucceeded in vanquishing you once when transformed, Sir Don Quixote, mayfairly hope to subdue you in your own proper shape; but as it is notbecoming for knights to perform their feats of arms in the dark, likehighwaymen and bullies, let us wait till daylight, that the sun may beholdour deeds; and the conditions of our combat shall be that the vanquishedshall be at the victor&rsquo;s disposal, to do all that he may enjoin,provided the injunction be such as shall be becoming a knight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am more than satisfied with these conditions and terms,&rdquo;replied Don Quixote; and so saying, they betook themselves to where theirsquires lay, and found them snoring, and in the same posture they were inwhen sleep fell upon them. They roused them up, and bade them get thehorses ready, as at sunrise they were to engage in a bloody and arduoussingle combat; at which intelligence Sancho was aghast and thunderstruck,trembling for the safety of his master because of the mighty deeds he hadheard the squire of the Grove ascribe to his; but without a word the twosquires went in quest of their cattle; for by this time the three horsesand the ass had smelt one another out, and were all together.</p><p>On the way, he of the Grove said to Sancho, &ldquo;You must know, brother,that it is the custom with the fighting men of Andalusia, when they aregodfathers in any quarrel, not to stand idle with folded arms while theirgodsons fight; I say so to remind you that while our masters are fighting,we, too, have to fight, and knock one another to shivers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That custom, sir squire,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;may holdgood among those bullies and fighting men you talk of, but certainly notamong the squires of knights-errant; at least, I have never heard mymaster speak of any custom of the sort, and he knows all the laws ofknight-errantry by heart; but granting it true that there is an expresslaw that squires are to fight while their masters are fighting, I don&rsquo;tmean to obey it, but to pay the penalty that may be laid on peacefullyminded squires like myself; for I am sure it cannot be more than twopounds of wax, and I would rather pay that, for I know it will cost meless than the lint I shall be at the expense of to mend my head, which Ilook upon as broken and split already; there&rsquo;s another thing thatmakes it impossible for me to fight, that I have no sword, for I nevercarried one in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know a good remedy for that,&rdquo; said he of the Grove; &ldquo;Ihave here two linen bags of the same size; you shall take one, and I theother, and we will fight at bag blows with equal arms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the way, so be it with all my heart,&rdquo; saidSancho, &ldquo;for that sort of battle will serve to knock the dust out ofus instead of hurting us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That will not do,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;for we must putinto the bags, to keep the wind from blowing them away, half a dozen nicesmooth pebbles, all of the same weight; and in this way we shall be ableto baste one another without doing ourselves any harm or mischief.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Body of my father!&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;see what marten andsable, and pads of carded cotton he is putting into the bags, that ourheads may not be broken and our bones beaten to jelly! But even if theyare filled with toss silk, I can tell you, señor, I am not going to fight;let our masters fight, that&rsquo;s their lookout, and let us drink andlive; for time will take care to ease us of our lives, without our goingto look for fillips so that they may be finished off before their propertime comes and they drop from ripeness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; returned he of the Grove, &ldquo;we must fight, if itbe only for half an hour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I am not going to be sodiscourteous or so ungrateful as to have any quarrel, be it ever so small,with one I have eaten and drunk with; besides, who the devil could bringhimself to fight in cold blood, without anger or provocation?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can remedy that entirely,&rdquo; said he of the Grove, &ldquo;andin this way: before we begin the battle, I will come up to your worshipfair and softly, and give you three or four buffets, with which I shallstretch you at my feet and rouse your anger, though it were sleepingsounder than a dormouse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To match that plan,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;I have another thatis not a whit behind it; I will take a cudgel, and before your worshipcomes near enough to waken my anger I will send yours so sound to sleepwith whacks, that it won&rsquo;t waken unless it be in the other world,where it is known that I am not a man to let my face be handled by anyone;let each look out for the arrow&mdash;though the surer way would be to leteveryone&rsquo;s anger sleep, for nobody knows the heart of anyone, and aman may come for wool and go back shorn; God gave his blessing to peaceand his curse to quarrels; if a hunted cat, surrounded and hard pressed,turns into a lion, God knows what I, who am a man, may turn into; and sofrom this time forth I warn you, sir squire, that all the harm andmischief that may come of our quarrel will be put down to your account.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said he of the Grove; &ldquo;God will send thedawn and we shall be all right.&rdquo;</p><p>And now gay-plumaged birds of all sorts began to warble in the trees, andwith their varied and gladsome notes seemed to welcome and salute thefresh morn that was beginning to show the beauty of her countenance at thegates and balconies of the east, shaking from her locks a profusion ofliquid pearls; in which dulcet moisture bathed, the plants, too, seemed toshed and shower down a pearly spray, the willows distilled sweet manna,the fountains laughed, the brooks babbled, the woods rejoiced, and themeadows arrayed themselves in all their glory at her coming. But hardlyhad the light of day made it possible to see and distinguish things, whenthe first object that presented itself to the eyes of Sancho Panza was thesquire of the Grove&rsquo;s nose, which was so big that it almostovershadowed his whole body. It is, in fact, stated, that it was ofenormous size, hooked in the middle, covered with warts, and of a mulberrycolour like an egg-plant; it hung down two fingers&rsquo; length below hismouth, and the size, the colour, the warts, and the bend of it, made hisface so hideous, that Sancho, as he looked at him, began to tremble handand foot like a child in convulsions, and he vowed in his heart to lethimself be given two hundred buffets, sooner than be provoked to fightthat monster. Don Quixote examined his adversary, and found that healready had his helmet on and visor lowered, so that he could not see hisface; he observed, however, that he was a sturdily built man, but not verytall in stature. Over his armour he wore a surcoat or cassock of whatseemed to be the finest cloth of gold, all bespangled with glitteringmirrors like little moons, which gave him an extremely gallant andsplendid appearance; above his helmet fluttered a great quantity ofplumes, green, yellow, and white, and his lance, which was leaning againsta tree, was very long and stout, and had a steel point more than a palm inlength.</p><p>Don Quixote observed all, and took note of all, and from what he saw andobserved he concluded that the said knight must be a man of greatstrength, but he did not for all that give way to fear, like Sancho Panza;on the contrary, with a composed and dauntless air, he said to the Knightof the Mirrors, &ldquo;If, sir knight, your great eagerness to fight hasnot banished your courtesy, by it I would entreat you to raise your visora little, in order that I may see if the comeliness of your countenancecorresponds with that of your equipment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whether you come victorious or vanquished out of this emprise, sirknight,&rdquo; replied he of the Mirrors, &ldquo;you will have more thanenough time and leisure to see me; and if now I do not comply with yourrequest, it is because it seems to me I should do a serious wrong to thefair Casildea de Vandalia in wasting time while I stopped to raise myvisor before compelling you to confess what you are already aware Imaintain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;while we are mountingyou can at least tell me if I am that Don Quixote whom you said youvanquished.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To that we answer you,&rdquo; said he of the Mirrors, &ldquo;thatyou are as like the very knight I vanquished as one egg is like another,but as you say enchanters persecute you, I will not venture to saypositively whether you are the said person or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;is enough to convince me thatyou are under a deception; however, entirely to relieve you of it, let ourhorses be brought, and in less time than it would take you to raise yourvisor, if God, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, I shall seeyour face, and you shall see that I am not the vanquished Don Quixote youtake me to be.&rdquo;</p><p>With this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and Don Quixotewheeled Rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to charge backupon his adversary, and he of the Mirrors did the same; but Don Quixotehad not moved away twenty paces when he heard himself called by the other,and, each returning half-way, he of the Mirrors said to him, &ldquo;Remember,sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that the vanquished, as Isaid before, shall be at the victor&rsquo;s disposal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am aware of it already,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;providedwhat is commanded and imposed upon the vanquished be things that do nottransgress the limits of chivalry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is understood,&rdquo; replied he of the Mirrors.</p><p>At this moment the extraordinary nose of the squire presented itself toDon Quixote&rsquo;s view, and he was no less amazed than Sancho at thesight; insomuch that he set him down as a monster of some kind, or a humanbeing of some new species or unearthly breed. Sancho, seeing his masterretiring to run his course, did not like to be left alone with the nosyman, fearing that with one flap of that nose on his own the battle wouldbe all over for him and he would be left stretched on the ground, eitherby the blow or with fright; so he ran after his master, holding on toRocinante&rsquo;s stirrup-leather, and when it seemed to him time to turnabout, he said, &ldquo;I implore of your worship, señor, before you turnto charge, to help me up into this cork tree, from which I will be able towitness the gallant encounter your worship is going to have with thisknight, more to my taste and better than from the ground.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It seems to me rather, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;thatthou wouldst mount a scaffold in order to see the bulls without danger.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To tell the truth,&rdquo; returned Sancho, &ldquo;the monstrousnose of that squire has filled me with fear and terror, and I dare notstay near him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;such a one that were I notwhat I am it would terrify me too; so, come, I will help thee up wherethou wilt.&rdquo;</p><p>While Don Quixote waited for Sancho to mount into the cork tree he of theMirrors took as much ground as he considered requisite, and, supposing DonQuixote to have done the same, without waiting for any sound of trumpet orother signal to direct them, he wheeled his horse, which was not moreagile or better-looking than Rocinante, and at his top speed, which was aneasy trot, he proceeded to charge his enemy; seeing him, however, engagedin putting Sancho up, he drew rein, and halted in mid career, for whichhis horse was very grateful, as he was already unable to go. Don Quixote,fancying that his foe was coming down upon him flying, drove his spursvigorously into Rocinante&rsquo;s lean flanks and made him scud along insuch style that the history tells us that on this occasion only was heknown to make something like running, for on all others it was a simpletrot with him; and with this unparalleled fury he bore down where he ofthe Mirrors stood digging his spurs into his horse up to buttons, withoutbeing able to make him stir a finger&rsquo;s length from the spot where hehad come to a standstill in his course. At this lucky moment and crisis,Don Quixote came upon his adversary, in trouble with his horse, andembarrassed with his lance, which he either could not manage, or had notime to lay in rest. Don Quixote, however, paid no attention to thesedifficulties, and in perfect safety to himself and without any riskencountered him of the Mirrors with such force that he brought him to theground in spite of himself over the haunches of his horse, and with soheavy a fall that he lay to all appearance dead, not stirring hand orfoot. The instant Sancho saw him fall he slid down from the cork tree, andmade all haste to where his master was, who, dismounting from Rocinante,went and stood over him of the Mirrors, and unlacing his helmet to see ifhe was dead, and to give him air if he should happen to be alive, he saw&mdash;whocan say what he saw, without filling all who hear it with astonishment,wonder, and awe? He saw, the history says, the very countenance, the veryface, the very look, the very physiognomy, the very effigy, the very imageof the bachelor Samson Carrasco! As soon as he saw it he called out in aloud voice, &ldquo;Make haste here, Sancho, and behold what thou art tosee but not to believe; quick, my son, and learn what magic can do, andwizards and enchanters are capable of.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho came up, and when he saw the countenance of the bachelor Carrasco,he fell to crossing himself a thousand times, and blessing himself as manymore. All this time the prostrate knight showed no signs of life, andSancho said to Don Quixote, &ldquo;It is my opinion, señor, that in anycase your worship should take and thrust your sword into the mouth of thisone here that looks like the bachelor Samson Carrasco; perhaps in him youwill kill one of your enemies, the enchanters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thy advice is not bad,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for ofenemies the fewer the better;&rdquo; and he was drawing his sword to carryinto effect Sancho&rsquo;s counsel and suggestion, when the squire of theMirrors came up, now without the nose which had made him so hideous, andcried out in a loud voice, &ldquo;Mind what you are about, Señor DonQuixote; that is your friend, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, you have atyour feet, and I am his squire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the nose?&rdquo; said Sancho, seeing him without the hideousfeature he had before; to which he replied, &ldquo;I have it here in mypocket,&rdquo; and putting his hand into his right pocket, he pulled out amasquerade nose of varnished pasteboard of the make already described; andSancho, examining him more and more closely, exclaimed aloud in a voice ofamazement, &ldquo;Holy Mary be good to me! Isn&rsquo;t it Tom Cecial, myneighbour and gossip?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, to be sure I am!&rdquo; returned the now unnosed squire;&ldquo;Tom Cecial I am, gossip and friend Sancho Panza; and I&rsquo;lltell you presently the means and tricks and falsehoods by which I havebeen brought here; but in the meantime, beg and entreat of your master notto touch, maltreat, wound, or slay the Knight of the Mirrors whom he hasat his feet; because, beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advisedbachelor Samson Carrasco, our fellow townsman.&rdquo;</p><p>At this moment he of the Mirrors came to himself, and Don Quixoteperceiving it, held the naked point of his sword over his face, and saidto him, &ldquo;You are a dead man, knight, unless you confess that thepeerless Dulcinea del Toboso excels your Casildea de Vandalia in beauty;and in addition to this you must promise, if you should survive thisencounter and fall, to go to the city of El Toboso and present yourselfbefore her on my behalf, that she deal with you according to her goodpleasure; and if she leaves you free to do yours, you are in like mannerto return and seek me out (for the trail of my mighty deeds will serve youas a guide to lead you to where I may be), and tell me what may havepassed between you and her&mdash;conditions which, in accordance with whatwe stipulated before our combat, do not transgress the just limits ofknight-errantry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said the fallen knight, &ldquo;that the dirtytattered shoe of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso is better than theill-combed though clean beard of Casildea; and I promise to go and toreturn from her presence to yours, and to give you a full and particularaccount of all you demand of me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must also confess and believe,&rdquo; added Don Quixote,&ldquo;that the knight you vanquished was not and could not be Don Quixoteof La Mancha, but someone else in his likeness, just as I confess andbelieve that you, though you seem to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, arenot so, but some other resembling him, whom my enemies have here putbefore me in his shape, in order that I may restrain and moderate thevehemence of my wrath, and make a gentle use of the glory of my victory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I confess, hold, and think everything to be as you believe, hold,and think it,&rdquo; the crippled knight; &ldquo;let me rise, I entreatyou; if, indeed, the shock of my fall will allow me, for it has left me ina sorry plight enough.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote helped him to rise, with the assistance of his squire TomCecial; from whom Sancho never took his eyes, and to whom he putquestions, the replies to which furnished clear proof that he was reallyand truly the Tom Cecial he said; but the impression made on Sancho&rsquo;smind by what his master said about the enchanters having changed the faceof the Knight of the Mirrors into that of the bachelor Samson Carrasco,would not permit him to believe what he saw with his eyes. In fine, bothmaster and man remained under the delusion; and, down in the mouth, andout of luck, he of the Mirrors and his squire parted from Don Quixote andSancho, he meaning to go look for some village where he could plaster andstrap his ribs. Don Quixote and Sancho resumed their journey to Saragossa,and on it the history leaves them in order that it may tell who the Knightof the Mirrors and his long-nosed squire were.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p14e" id="p14e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p14e.jpg (56K)" src="images/p14e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch15b" id="ch15b"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br/>WHEREIN IT IS TOLD AND KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS AND HIS SQUIREWERE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p15a" id="p15a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p15a.jpg (122K)" src="images/p15a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p15a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote went off satisfied, elated, and vain-glorious in the highestdegree at having won a victory over such a valiant knight as he fanciedhim of the Mirrors to be, and one from whose knightly word he expected tolearn whether the enchantment of his lady still continued; inasmuch as thesaid vanquished knight was bound, under the penalty of ceasing to be one,to return and render him an account of what took place between him andher. But Don Quixote was of one mind, he of the Mirrors of another, for hejust then had no thought of anything but finding some village where hecould plaster himself, as has been said already. The history goes on tosay, then, that when the bachelor Samson Carrasco recommended Don Quixoteto resume his knight-errantry which he had laid aside, it was inconsequence of having been previously in conclave with the curate and thebarber on the means to be adopted to induce Don Quixote to stay at home inpeace and quiet without worrying himself with his ill-starred adventures;at which consultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of all, and onthe special advice of Carrasco, that Don Quixote should be allowed to go,as it seemed impossible to restrain him, and that Samson should sallyforth to meet him as a knight-errant, and do battle with him, for therewould be no difficulty about a cause, and vanquish him, that being lookedupon as an easy matter; and that it should be agreed and settled that thevanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor. Then, Don Quixote beingvanquished, the bachelor knight was to command him to return to hisvillage and his house, and not quit it for two years, or until he receivedfurther orders from him; all which it was clear Don Quixote wouldunhesitatingly obey, rather than contravene or fail to observe the laws ofchivalry; and during the period of his seclusion he might perhaps forgethis folly, or there might be an opportunity of discovering some readyremedy for his madness. Carrasco undertook the task, and Tom Cecial, agossip and neighbour of Sancho Panza&rsquo;s, a lively, feather-headedfellow, offered himself as his squire. Carrasco armed himself in thefashion described, and Tom Cecial, that he might not be known by hisgossip when they met, fitted on over his own natural nose the falsemasquerade one that has been mentioned; and so they followed the sameroute Don Quixote took, and almost came up with him in time to be presentat the adventure of the cart of Death and finally encountered them in thegrove, where all that the sagacious reader has been reading about tookplace; and had it not been for the extraordinary fancies of Don Quixote,and his conviction that the bachelor was not the bachelor, señor bachelorwould have been incapacitated for ever from taking his degree oflicentiate, all through not finding nests where he thought to find birds.</p><p>Tom Cecial, seeing how ill they had succeeded, and what a sorry end theirexpedition had come to, said to the bachelor, &ldquo;Sure enough, SeñorSamson Carrasco, we are served right; it is easy enough to plan and setabout an enterprise, but it is often a difficult matter to come well outof it. Don Quixote a madman, and we sane; he goes off laughing, safe, andsound, and you are left sore and sorry! I&rsquo;d like to know now whichis the madder, he who is so because he cannot help it, or he who is so ofhis own choice?&rdquo;</p><p>To which Samson replied, &ldquo;The difference between the two sorts ofmadmen is, that he who is so will he nil he, will be one always, while hewho is so of his own accord can leave off being one whenever he likes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Tom Cecial, &ldquo;I was a madman of myown accord when I volunteered to become your squire, and, of my ownaccord, I&rsquo;ll leave off being one and go home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your affair,&rdquo; returned Samson, &ldquo;but tosuppose that I am going home until I have given Don Quixote a thrashing isabsurd; and it is not any wish that he may recover his senses that willmake me hunt him out now, but a wish for the sore pain I am in with myribs won&rsquo;t let me entertain more charitable thoughts.&rdquo;</p><p>Thus discoursing, the pair proceeded until they reached a town where itwas their good luck to find a bone-setter, with whose help the unfortunateSamson was cured. Tom Cecial left him and went home, while he stayedbehind meditating vengeance; and the history will return to him again atthe proper time, so as not to omit making merry with Don Quixote now.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p15e" id="p15e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p15e.jpg (17K)" src="images/p15e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch16b" id="ch16b"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br/>OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH A DISCREET GENTLEMAN OF LA MANCHA</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p16a" id="p16a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p16a.jpg (85K)" src="images/p16a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p16a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote pursued his journey in the high spirits, satisfaction, andself-complacency already described, fancying himself the most valorousknight-errant of the age in the world because of his late victory. All theadventures that could befall him from that time forth he regarded asalready done and brought to a happy issue; he made light of enchantmentsand enchanters; he thought no more of the countless drubbings that hadbeen administered to him in the course of his knight-errantry, nor of thevolley of stones that had levelled half his teeth, nor of the ingratitudeof the galley slaves, nor of the audacity of the Yanguesans and the showerof stakes that fell upon him; in short, he said to himself that could hediscover any means, mode, or way of disenchanting his lady Dulcinea, hewould not envy the highest fortune that the most fortunate knight-errantof yore ever reached or could reach.</p><p>He was going along entirely absorbed in these fancies, when Sancho said tohim, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it odd, señor, that I have still before my eyesthat monstrous enormous nose of my gossip, Tom Cecial?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And dost thou, then, believe, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;that the Knight of the Mirrors was the bachelor Carrasco, and hissquire Tom Cecial thy gossip?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say to that,&rdquo; replied Sancho;&ldquo;all I know is that the tokens he gave me about my own house, wifeand children, nobody else but himself could have given me; and the face,once the nose was off, was the very face of Tom Cecial, as I have seen itmany a time in my town and next door to my own house; and the sound of thevoice was just the same.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us reason the matter, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote. &ldquo;Comenow, by what process of thinking can it be supposed that the bachelorSamson Carrasco would come as a knight-errant, in arms offensive anddefensive, to fight with me? Have I ever been by any chance his enemy?Have I ever given him any occasion to owe me a grudge? Am I his rival, ordoes he profess arms, that he should envy the fame I have acquired inthem?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, but what are we to say, señor,&rdquo; returned Sancho,&ldquo;about that knight, whoever he is, being so like the bachelorCarrasco, and his squire so like my gossip, Tom Cecial? And if that beenchantment, as your worship says, was there no other pair in the worldfor them to take the likeness of?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is all,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;a scheme and plot of themalignant magicians that persecute me, who, foreseeing that I was to bevictorious in the conflict, arranged that the vanquished knight shoulddisplay the countenance of my friend the bachelor, in order that thefriendship I bear him should interpose to stay the edge of my sword andmight of my arm, and temper the just wrath of my heart; so that he whosought to take my life by fraud and falsehood should save his own. And toprove it, thou knowest already, Sancho, by experience which cannot lie ordeceive, how easy it is for enchanters to change one countenance intoanother, turning fair into foul, and foul into fair; for it is not twodays since thou sawest with thine own eyes the beauty and elegance of thepeerless Dulcinea in all its perfection and natural harmony, while I sawher in the repulsive and mean form of a coarse country wench, withcataracts in her eyes and a foul smell in her mouth; and when the perverseenchanter ventured to effect so wicked a transformation, it is no wonderif he effected that of Samson Carrasco and thy gossip in order to snatchthe glory of victory out of my grasp. For all that, however, I consolemyself, because, after all, in whatever shape he may have been, I havebeen victorious over my enemy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God knows what&rsquo;s the truth of it all,&rdquo; said Sancho; andknowing as he did that the transformation of Dulcinea had been a deviceand imposition of his own, his master&rsquo;s illusions were notsatisfactory to him; but he did not like to reply lest he should saysomething that might disclose his trickery.</p><p>As they were engaged in this conversation they were overtaken by a man whowas following the same road behind them, mounted on a very handsomeflea-bitten mare, and dressed in a gaban of fine green cloth, with tawnyvelvet facings, and a montera of the same velvet. The trappings of themare were of the field and jineta fashion, and of mulberry colour andgreen. He carried a Moorish cutlass hanging from a broad green and goldbaldric; the buskins were of the same make as the baldric; the spurs werenot gilt, but lacquered green, and so brightly polished that, matching asthey did the rest of his apparel, they looked better than if they had beenof pure gold.</p><p>When the traveller came up with them he saluted them courteously, andspurring his mare was passing them without stopping, but Don Quixotecalled out to him, &ldquo;Gallant sir, if so be your worship is going ourroad, and has no occasion for speed, it would be a pleasure to me if wewere to join company.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; replied he on the mare, &ldquo;I would not passyou so hastily but for fear that horse might turn restive in the companyof my mare.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You may safely hold in your mare, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho inreply to this, &ldquo;for our horse is the most virtuous and well-behavedhorse in the world; he never does anything wrong on such occasions, andthe only time he misbehaved, my master and I suffered for it sevenfold; Isay again your worship may pull up if you like; for if she was offered tohim between two plates the horse would not hanker after her.&rdquo;</p><p>The traveller drew rein, amazed at the trim and features of Don Quixote,who rode without his helmet, which Sancho carried like a valise in frontof Dapple&rsquo;s pack-saddle; and if the man in green examined DonQuixote closely, still more closely did Don Quixote examine the man ingreen, who struck him as being a man of intelligence. In appearance he wasabout fifty years of age, with but few grey hairs, an aquiline cast offeatures, and an expression between grave and gay; and his dress andaccoutrements showed him to be a man of good condition. What he in greenthought of Don Quixote of La Mancha was that a man of that sort and shapehe had never yet seen; he marvelled at the length of his hair, his loftystature, the lankness and sallowness of his countenance, his armour, hisbearing and his gravity&mdash;a figure and picture such as had not beenseen in those regions for many a long day.</p><p>Don Quixote saw very plainly the attention with which the traveller wasregarding him, and read his curiosity in his astonishment; and courteousas he was and ready to please everybody, before the other could ask himany question he anticipated him by saying, &ldquo;The appearance I presentto your worship being so strange and so out of the common, I should not besurprised if it filled you with wonder; but you will cease to wonder whenI tell you, as I do, that I am one of those knights who, as people say, goseeking adventures. I have left my home, I have mortgaged my estate, Ihave given up my comforts, and committed myself to the arms of Fortune, tobear me whithersoever she may please. My desire was to bring to life againknight-errantry, now dead, and for some time past, stumbling here, fallingthere, now coming down headlong, now raising myself up again, I havecarried out a great portion of my design, succouring widows, protectingmaidens, and giving aid to wives, orphans, and minors, the proper andnatural duty of knights-errant; and, therefore, because of my many valiantand Christian achievements, I have been already found worthy to make myway in print to well-nigh all, or most, of the nations of the earth.Thirty thousand volumes of my history have been printed, and it is on thehigh-road to be printed thirty thousand thousands of times, if heaven doesnot put a stop to it. In short, to sum up all in a few words, or in asingle one, I may tell you I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called&lsquo;The Knight of the Rueful Countenance;&rsquo; for though self-praiseis degrading, I must perforce sound my own sometimes, that is to say, whenthere is no one at hand to do it for me. So that, gentle sir, neither thishorse, nor this lance, nor this shield, nor this squire, nor all thesearms put together, nor the sallowness of my countenance, nor my gauntleanness, will henceforth astonish you, now that you know who I am andwhat profession I follow.&rdquo;</p><p>With these words Don Quixote held his peace, and, from the time he took toanswer, the man in green seemed to be at a loss for a reply; after a longpause, however, he said to him, &ldquo;You were right when you sawcuriosity in my amazement, sir knight; but you have not succeeded inremoving the astonishment I feel at seeing you; for although you say,señor, that knowing who you are ought to remove it, it has not done so; onthe contrary, now that I know, I am left more amazed and astonished thanbefore. What! is it possible that there are knights-errant in the world inthese days, and histories of real chivalry printed? I cannot realise thefact that there can be anyone on earth now-a-days who aids widows, orprotects maidens, or defends wives, or succours orphans; nor should Ibelieve it had I not seen it in your worship with my own eyes. Blessed beheaven! for by means of this history of your noble and genuine chivalrousdeeds, which you say has been printed, the countless stories of fictitiousknights-errant with which the world is filled, so much to the injury ofmorality and the prejudice and discredit of good histories, will have beendriven into oblivion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is a good deal to be said on that point,&rdquo; said DonQuixote, &ldquo;as to whether the histories of the knights-errant arefiction or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, is there anyone who doubts that those histories are false?&rdquo;said the man in green.</p><p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;but never mind thatjust now; if our journey lasts long enough, I trust in God I shall showyour worship that you do wrong in going with the stream of those whoregard it as a matter of certainty that they are not true.&rdquo;</p><p>From this last observation of Don Quixote&rsquo;s, the traveller began tohave a suspicion that he was some crazy being, and was waiting for him toconfirm it by something further; but before they could turn to any newsubject Don Quixote begged him to tell him who he was, since he himselfhad rendered account of his station and life. To this, he in the greengaban replied &ldquo;I, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, am agentleman by birth, native of the village where, please God, we are goingto dine to-day; I am more than fairly well off, and my name is Don Diego deMiranda. I pass my life with my wife, children, and friends; my pursuitsare hunting and fishing, but I keep neither hawks nor greyhounds, nothingbut a tame partridge or a bold ferret or two; I have six dozen or so ofbooks, some in our mother tongue, some Latin, some of them history, othersdevotional; those of chivalry have not as yet crossed the threshold of mydoor; I am more given to turning over the profane than the devotional, solong as they are books of honest entertainment that charm by their styleand attract and interest by the invention they display, though of thesethere are very few in Spain. Sometimes I dine with my neighbours andfriends, and often invite them; my entertainments are neat and well servedwithout stint of anything. I have no taste for tattle, nor do I allowtattling in my presence; I pry not into my neighbours&rsquo; lives, norhave I lynx-eyes for what others do. I hear mass every day; I share mysubstance with the poor, making no display of good works, lest I lethypocrisy and vainglory, those enemies that subtly take possession of themost watchful heart, find an entrance into mine. I strive to make peacebetween those whom I know to be at variance; I am the devoted servant ofOur Lady, and my trust is ever in the infinite mercy of God our Lord.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho listened with the greatest attention to the account of thegentleman&rsquo;s life and occupation; and thinking it a good and a holylife, and that he who led it ought to work miracles, he threw himself offDapple, and running in haste seized his right stirrup and kissed his footagain and again with a devout heart and almost with tears.</p><p>Seeing this the gentleman asked him, &ldquo;What are you about, brother?What are these kisses for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me kiss,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for I think your worship isthe first saint in the saddle I ever saw all the days of my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am no saint,&rdquo; replied the gentleman, &ldquo;but a greatsinner; but you are, brother, for you must be a good fellow, as yoursimplicity shows.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho went back and regained his pack-saddle, having extracted a laughfrom his master&rsquo;s profound melancholy, and excited fresh amazementin Don Diego. Don Quixote then asked him how many children he had, andobserved that one of the things wherein the ancient philosophers, who werewithout the true knowledge of God, placed the <i>summum bonum</i> was in thegifts of nature, in those of fortune, in having many friends, and many andgood children.</p><p>&ldquo;I, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; answered the gentleman, &ldquo;haveone son, without whom, perhaps, I should count myself happier than I am,not because he is a bad son, but because he is not so good as I couldwish. He is eighteen years of age; he has been for six at Salamancastudying Latin and Greek, and when I wished him to turn to the study ofother sciences I found him so wrapped up in that of poetry (if that can becalled a science) that there is no getting him to take kindly to the law,which I wished him to study, or to theology, the queen of them all. Iwould like him to be an honour to his family, as we live in days when ourkings liberally reward learning that is virtuous and worthy; for learningwithout virtue is a pearl on a dunghill. He spends the whole day insettling whether Homer expressed himself correctly or not in such and sucha line of the Iliad, whether Martial was indecent or not in such and suchan epigram, whether such and such lines of Virgil are to be understood inthis way or in that; in short, all his talk is of the works of thesepoets, and those of Horace, Perseus, Juvenal, and Tibullus; for of themoderns in our own language he makes no great account; but with all hisseeming indifference to Spanish poetry, just now his thoughts are absorbedin making a gloss on four lines that have been sent him from Salamanca,which I suspect are for some poetical tournament.&rdquo;</p><p>To all this Don Quixote said in reply, &ldquo;Children, señor, are portions oftheir parents&rsquo; bowels, and therefore, be they good or bad, are to beloved as we love the souls that give us life; it is for the parents to guidethem from infancy in the ways of virtue, propriety, and worthy Christianconduct, so that when grown up they may be the staff of their parents&rsquo;old age, and the glory of their posterity; and to force them to study this orthat science I do not think wise, though it may be no harm to persuade them;and when there is no need to study for the sake of <i>pane lucrando</i>, and itis the student&rsquo;s good fortune that heaven has given him parents whoprovide him with it, it would be my advice to them to let him pursue whateverscience they may see him most inclined to; and though that of poetry is lessuseful than pleasurable, it is not one of those that bring discredit upon thepossessor. Poetry, gentle sir, is, as I take it, like a tender young maiden ofsupreme beauty, to array, bedeck, and adorn whom is the task of several othermaidens, who are all the rest of the sciences; and she must avail herself ofthe help of all, and all derive their lustre from her. But this maiden will notbear to be handled, nor dragged through the streets, nor exposed either at thecorners of the market-places, or in the closets of palaces. She is the productof an Alchemy of such virtue that he who is able to practise it, will turn herinto pure gold of inestimable worth. He that possesses her must keep her withinbounds, not permitting her to break out in ribald satires or soulless sonnets.She must on no account be offered for sale, unless, indeed, it be in heroicpoems, moving tragedies, or sprightly and ingenious comedies. She must not betouched by the buffoons, nor by the ignorant vulgar, incapable of comprehendingor appreciating her hidden treasures. And do not suppose, señor, that I applythe term vulgar here merely to plebeians and the lower orders; for everyone whois ignorant, be he lord or prince, may and should be included among the vulgar.He, then, who shall embrace and cultivate poetry under the conditions I havenamed, shall become famous, and his name honoured throughout all the civilisednations of the earth. And with regard to what you say, señor, of your sonhaving no great opinion of Spanish poetry, I am inclined to think that he isnot quite right there, and for this reason: the great poet Homer did not writein Latin, because he was a Greek, nor did Virgil write in Greek, because he wasa Latin; in short, all the ancient poets wrote in the language they imbibedwith their mother&rsquo;s milk, and never went in quest of foreign ones toexpress their sublime conceptions; and that being so, the usage should injustice extend to all nations, and the German poet should not be undervaluedbecause he writes in his own language, nor the Castilian, nor even theBiscayan, for writing in his. But your son, señor, I suspect, is not prejudicedagainst Spanish poetry, but against those poets who are mere Spanish versewriters, without any knowledge of other languages or sciences to adorn and givelife and vigour to their natural inspiration; and yet even in this he may bewrong; for, according to a true belief, a poet is born one; that is to say, thepoet by nature comes forth a poet from his mother&rsquo;s womb; and followingthe bent that heaven has bestowed upon him, without the aid of study or art, heproduces things that show how truly he spoke who said, &lsquo;<i>Est Deus innobis</i>,&rsquo; etc. At the same time, I say that the poet by nature whocalls in art to his aid will be a far better poet, and will surpass him whotries to be one relying upon his knowledge of art alone. The reason is, thatart does not surpass nature, but only brings it to perfection; and thus, naturecombined with art, and art with nature, will produce a perfect poet. To bringmy argument to a close, I would say then, gentle sir, let your son go on as hisstar leads him, for being so studious as he seems to be, and having alreadysuccessfully surmounted the first step of the sciences, which is that of thelanguages, with their help he will by his own exertions reach the summit ofpolite literature, which so well becomes an independent gentleman, and adorns,honours, and distinguishes him, as much as the mitre does the bishop, or thegown the learned counsellor. If your son write satires reflecting on the honourof others, chide and correct him, and tear them up; but if he composediscourses in which he rebukes vice in general, in the style of Horace, andwith elegance like his, commend him; for it is legitimate for a poet to writeagainst envy and lash the envious in his verse, and the other vices too,provided he does not single out individuals; there are, however, poets who, forthe sake of saying something spiteful, would run the risk of being banished tothe coast of Pontus. If the poet be pure in his morals, he will be pure in hisverses too; the pen is the tongue of the mind, and as the thought engenderedthere, so will be the things that it writes down. And when kings and princesobserve this marvellous science of poetry in wise, virtuous, and thoughtfulsubjects, they honour, value, exalt them, and even crown them with the leavesof that tree which the thunderbolt strikes not, as if to show that they whosebrows are honoured and adorned with such a crown are not to be assailed byanyone.&rdquo;</p><p>He of the green gaban was filled with astonishment at Don Quixote&rsquo;sargument, so much so that he began to abandon the notion he had taken upabout his being crazy. But in the middle of the discourse, it being notvery much to his taste, Sancho had turned aside out of the road to beg alittle milk from some shepherds, who were milking their ewes hard by; andjust as the gentleman, highly pleased, was about to renew theconversation, Don Quixote, raising his head, perceived a cart covered withroyal flags coming along the road they were travelling; and persuaded thatthis must be some new adventure, he called aloud to Sancho to come andbring him his helmet. Sancho, hearing himself called, quitted theshepherds, and, prodding Dapple vigorously, came up to his master, to whomthere fell a terrific and desperate adventure.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p16e" id="p16e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p16e.jpg (49K)" src="images/p16e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch17b" id="ch17b"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br/>WHEREIN IS SHOWN THE FURTHEST AND HIGHEST POINT WHICH THE UNEXAMPLEDCOURAGE OF DON QUIXOTE REACHED OR COULD REACH; TOGETHER WITH THE HAPPILYACHIEVED ADVENTURE OF THE LIONS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p17a" id="p17a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p17a.jpg (137K)" src="images/p17a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p17a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The history tells that when Don Quixote called out to Sancho to bring himhis helmet, Sancho was buying some curds the shepherds agreed to sell him,and flurried by the great haste his master was in did not know what to dowith them or what to carry them in; so, not to lose them, for he hadalready paid for them, he thought it best to throw them into his master&rsquo;shelmet, and acting on this bright idea he went to see what his masterwanted with him. He, as he approached, exclaimed to him:</p><p>&ldquo;Give me that helmet, my friend, for either I know little ofadventures, or what I observe yonder is one that will, and does, call uponme to arm myself.&rdquo;</p><p>He of the green gaban, on hearing this, looked in all directions, butcould perceive nothing, except a cart coming towards them with two orthree small flags, which led him to conclude it must be carrying treasureof the King&rsquo;s, and he said so to Don Quixote. He, however, would notbelieve him, being always persuaded and convinced that all that happenedto him must be adventures and still more adventures; so he replied to thegentleman, &ldquo;He who is prepared has his battle half fought; nothingis lost by my preparing myself, for I know by experience that I haveenemies, visible and invisible, and I know not when, or where, or at whatmoment, or in what shapes they will attack me;&rdquo; and turning toSancho, he called for his helmet; and Sancho, as he had no time to takeout the curds, had to give it just as it was. Don Quixote took it, andwithout perceiving what was in it thrust it down in hot haste upon hishead; but as the curds were pressed and squeezed the whey began to run allover his face and beard, whereat he was so startled that he cried out toSancho:</p><p>&ldquo;Sancho, what&rsquo;s this? I think my head is softening, or mybrains are melting, or I am sweating from head to foot! If I am sweatingit is not indeed from fear. I am convinced beyond a doubt that theadventure which is about to befall me is a terrible one. Give me somethingto wipe myself with, if thou hast it, for this profuse sweat is blindingme.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho held his tongue, and gave him a cloth, and gave thanks to God atthe same time that his master had not found out what was the matter. DonQuixote then wiped himself, and took off his helmet to see what it wasthat made his head feel so cool, and seeing all that white mash inside hishelmet he put it to his nose, and as soon as he had smelt it he exclaimed:</p><p>&ldquo;By the life of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, but it is curds thouhast put here, thou treacherous, impudent, ill-mannered squire!&rdquo;</p><p>To which, with great composure and pretended innocence, Sancho replied,&ldquo;If they are curds let me have them, your worship, and I&rsquo;lleat them; but let the devil eat them, for it must have been he who putthem there. I dare to dirty your helmet! You have guessed the offenderfinely! Faith, sir, by the light God gives me, it seems I must haveenchanters too, that persecute me as a creature and limb of your worship,and they must have put that nastiness there in order to provoke yourpatience to anger, and make you baste my ribs as you are wont to do. Well,this time, indeed, they have missed their aim, for I trust to my master&rsquo;sgood sense to see that I have got no curds or milk, or anything of thesort; and that if I had it is in my stomach I would put it and not in thehelmet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May be so,&rdquo; said Don Quixote. All this the gentleman wasobserving, and with astonishment, more especially when, after having wipedhimself clean, his head, face, beard, and helmet, Don Quixote put it on,and settling himself firmly in his stirrups, easing his sword in thescabbard, and grasping his lance, he cried, &ldquo;Now, come who will,here am I, ready to try conclusions with Satan himself in person!&rdquo;</p><p>By this time the cart with the flags had come up, unattended by anyoneexcept the carter on a mule, and a man sitting in front. Don Quixoteplanted himself before it and said, &ldquo;Whither are you going,brothers? What cart is this? What have you got in it? What flags arethose?&rdquo;</p><p>To this the carter replied, &ldquo;The cart is mine; what is in it is apair of wild caged lions, which the governor of Oran is sending to courtas a present to his Majesty; and the flags are our lord the King&rsquo;s,to show that what is here is his property.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And are the lions large?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;So large,&rdquo; replied the man who sat at the door of the cart,&ldquo;that larger, or as large, have never crossed from Africa to Spain;I am the keeper, and I have brought over others, but never any like these.They are male and female; the male is in that first cage and the female inthe one behind, and they are hungry now, for they have eaten nothingto-day, so let your worship stand aside, for we must make haste to theplace where we are to feed them.&rdquo;</p><p>Hereupon, smiling slightly, Don Quixote exclaimed, &ldquo;Lion-whelps tome! to me whelps of lions, and at such a time! Then, by God! thosegentlemen who send them here shall see if I am a man to be frightened bylions. Get down, my good fellow, and as you are the keeper open the cages,and turn me out those beasts, and in the midst of this plain I will letthem know who Don Quixote of La Mancha is, in spite and in the teeth ofthe enchanters who send them to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, so,&rdquo; said the gentleman to himself at this; &ldquo;ourworthy knight has shown of what sort he is; the curds, no doubt, havesoftened his skull and brought his brains to a head.&rdquo;</p><p>At this instant Sancho came up to him, saying, &ldquo;Señor, for God&rsquo;ssake do something to keep my master, Don Quixote, from tackling theselions; for if he does they&rsquo;ll tear us all to pieces here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is your master then so mad,&rdquo; asked the gentleman, &ldquo;thatyou believe and are afraid he will engage such fierce animals?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is not mad,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but he is venturesome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will prevent it,&rdquo; said the gentleman; and going over to DonQuixote, who was insisting upon the keeper&rsquo;s opening the cages, hesaid to him, &ldquo;Sir knight, knights-errant should attempt adventureswhich encourage the hope of a successful issue, not those which entirelywithhold it; for valour that trenches upon temerity savours rather ofmadness than of courage; moreover, these lions do not come to oppose you,nor do they dream of such a thing; they are going as presents to hisMajesty, and it will not be right to stop them or delay their journey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gentle sir,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;you go and mind yourtame partridge and your bold ferret, and leave everyone to manage his ownbusiness; this is mine, and I know whether these gentlemen the lions cometo me or not;&rdquo; and then turning to the keeper he exclaimed, &ldquo;Byall that&rsquo;s good, sir scoundrel, if you don&rsquo;t open the cagesthis very instant, I&rsquo;ll pin you to the cart with this lance.&rdquo;</p><p>The carter, seeing the determination of this apparition in armour, said tohim, &ldquo;Please your worship, for charity&rsquo;s sake, señor, let meunyoke the mules and place myself in safety along with them before thelions are turned out; for if they kill them on me I am ruined for life,for all I possess is this cart and mules.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O man of little faith,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;get downand unyoke; you will soon see that you are exerting yourself for nothing,and that you might have spared yourself the trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>The carter got down and with all speed unyoked the mules, and the keepercalled out at the top of his voice, &ldquo;I call all here to witness thatagainst my will and under compulsion I open the cages and let the lionsloose, and that I warn this gentleman that he will be accountable for allthe harm and mischief which these beasts may do, and for my salary anddues as well. You, gentlemen, place yourselves in safety before I open,for I know they will do me no harm.&rdquo;</p><p>Once more the gentleman strove to persuade Don Quixote not to do such amad thing, as it was tempting God to engage in such a piece of folly. Tothis, Don Quixote replied that he knew what he was about. The gentleman inreturn entreated him to reflect, for he knew he was under a delusion.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, señor,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;if you do not liketo be a spectator of this tragedy, as in your opinion it will be, spuryour flea-bitten mare, and place yourself in safety.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing this, Sancho with tears in his eyes entreated him to give up anenterprise compared with which the one of the windmills, and the awful oneof the fulling mills, and, in fact, all the feats he had attempted in thewhole course of his life, were cakes and fancy bread. &ldquo;Look ye,señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no enchantment here, noranything of the sort, for between the bars and chinks of the cage I haveseen the paw of a real lion, and judging by that I reckon the lion such apaw could belong to must be bigger than a mountain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fear at any rate,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;will make himlook bigger to thee than half the world. Retire, Sancho, and leave me; andif I die here thou knowest our old compact; thou wilt repair to Dulcinea&mdash;Isay no more.&rdquo; To these he added some further words that banished allhope of his giving up his insane project. He of the green gaban would haveoffered resistance, but he found himself ill-matched as to arms, and didnot think it prudent to come to blows with a madman, for such Don Quixotenow showed himself to be in every respect; and the latter, renewing hiscommands to the keeper and repeating his threats, gave warning to thegentleman to spur his mare, Sancho his Dapple, and the carter his mules,all striving to get away from the cart as far as they could before thelions broke loose. Sancho was weeping over his master&rsquo;s death, forthis time he firmly believed it was in store for him from the claws of thelions; and he cursed his fate and called it an unlucky hour when hethought of taking service with him again; but with all his tears andlamentations he did not forget to thrash Dapple so as to put a good spacebetween himself and the cart. The keeper, seeing that the fugitives werenow some distance off, once more entreated and warned him as before; buthe replied that he heard him, and that he need not trouble himself withany further warnings or entreaties, as they would be fruitless, and badehim make haste.</p><p>During the delay that occurred while the keeper was opening the firstcage, Don Quixote was considering whether it would not be well to dobattle on foot, instead of on horseback, and finally resolved to fight onfoot, fearing that Rocinante might take fright at the sight of the lions;he therefore sprang off his horse, flung his lance aside, braced hisbuckler on his arm, and drawing his sword, advanced slowly with marvellousintrepidity and resolute courage, to plant himself in front of the cart,commending himself with all his heart to God and to his lady Dulcinea.</p><p>It is to be observed, that on coming to this passage, the author of thisveracious history breaks out into exclamations. &ldquo;O doughty DonQuixote! high-mettled past extolling! Mirror, wherein all the heroes ofthe world may see themselves! Second modern Don Manuel de Leon, once theglory and honour of Spanish knighthood! In what words shall I describethis dread exploit, by what language shall I make it credible to ages tocome, what eulogies are there unmeet for thee, though they be hyperbolespiled on hyperboles! On foot, alone, undaunted, high-souled, with but asimple sword, and that no trenchant blade of the Perrillo brand, a shield,but no bright polished steel one, there stoodst thou, biding and awaitingthe two fiercest lions that Africa&rsquo;s forests ever bred! Thy owndeeds be thy praise, valiant Manchegan, and here I leave them as theystand, wanting the words wherewith to glorify them!&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p17b" id="p17b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p17b.jpg (352K)" src="images/p17b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p17b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Here the author&rsquo;s outburst came to an end, and he proceeded to takeup the thread of his story, saying that the keeper, seeing that DonQuixote had taken up his position, and that it was impossible for him toavoid letting out the male without incurring the enmity of the fiery anddaring knight, flung open the doors of the first cage, containing, as hasbeen said, the lion, which was now seen to be of enormous size, and grimand hideous mien. The first thing he did was to turn round in the cage inwhich he lay, and protrude his claws, and stretch himself thoroughly; henext opened his mouth, and yawned very leisurely, and with near two palms&rsquo;length of tongue that he had thrust forth, he licked the dust out of hiseyes and washed his face; having done this, he put his head out of thecage and looked all round with eyes like glowing coals, a spectacle anddemeanour to strike terror into temerity itself. Don Quixote merelyobserved him steadily, longing for him to leap from the cart and come toclose quarters with him, when he hoped to hew him in pieces.</p><p>So far did his unparalleled madness go; but the noble lion, more courteousthan arrogant, not troubling himself about silly bravado, after havinglooked all round, as has been said, turned about and presented hishind-quarters to Don Quixote, and very coolly and tranquilly lay downagain in the cage. Seeing this, Don Quixote ordered the keeper to take astick to him and provoke him to make him come out.</p><p>&ldquo;That I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the keeper; &ldquo;for if I angerhim, the first he&rsquo;ll tear in pieces will be myself. Be satisfied,sir knight, with what you have done, which leaves nothing more to be saidon the score of courage, and do not seek to tempt fortune a second time.The lion has the door open; he is free to come out or not to come out; butas he has not come out so far, he will not come out to-day. Your worship&rsquo;sgreat courage has been fully manifested already; no brave champion, so itstrikes me, is bound to do more than challenge his enemy and wait for himon the field; if his adversary does not come, on him lies the disgrace,and he who waits for him carries off the crown of victory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;close the door, myfriend, and let me have, in the best form thou canst, what thou hast seenme do, by way of certificate; to wit, that thou didst open for the lion,that I waited for him, that he did not come out, that I still waited forhim, and that still he did not come out, and lay down again. I am notbound to do more; enchantments avaunt, and God uphold the right, thetruth, and true chivalry! Close the door as I bade thee, while I makesignals to the fugitives that have left us, that they may learn thisexploit from thy lips.&rdquo;</p><p>The keeper obeyed, and Don Quixote, fixing on the point of his lance thecloth he had wiped his face with after the deluge of curds, proceeded torecall the others, who still continued to fly, looking back at every step,all in a body, the gentleman bringing up the rear. Sancho, however,happening to observe the signal of the white cloth, exclaimed, &ldquo;MayI die, if my master has not overcome the wild beasts, for he is calling tous.&rdquo;</p><p>They all stopped, and perceived that it was Don Quixote who was makingsignals, and shaking off their fears to some extent, they approachedslowly until they were near enough to hear distinctly Don Quixote&rsquo;svoice calling to them. They returned at length to the cart, and as theycame up, Don Quixote said to the carter, &ldquo;Put your mules to oncemore, brother, and continue your journey; and do thou, Sancho, give himtwo gold crowns for himself and the keeper, to compensate for the delaythey have incurred through me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That will I give with all my heart,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;butwhat has become of the lions? Are they dead or alive?&rdquo;</p><p>The keeper, then, in full detail, and bit by bit, described the end of thecontest, exalting to the best of his power and ability the valour of DonQuixote, at the sight of whom the lion quailed, and would not and darednot come out of the cage, although he had held the door open ever so long;and showing how, in consequence of his having represented to the knightthat it was tempting God to provoke the lion in order to force him out,which he wished to have done, he very reluctantly, and altogether againsthis will, had allowed the door to be closed.</p><p>&ldquo;What dost thou think of this, Sancho?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.&ldquo;Are there any enchantments that can prevail against true valour?The enchanters may be able to rob me of good fortune, but of fortitude andcourage they cannot.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho paid the crowns, the carter put to, the keeper kissed Don Quixote&rsquo;shands for the bounty bestowed upon him, and promised to give an account ofthe valiant exploit to the King himself, as soon as he saw him at court.</p><p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;if his Majesty should happento ask who performed it, you must say THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS; for it ismy desire that into this the name I have hitherto borne of Knight of theRueful Countenance be from this time forward changed, altered,transformed, and turned; and in this I follow the ancient usage ofknights-errant, who changed their names when they pleased, or when itsuited their purpose.&rdquo;</p><p>The cart went its way, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and he of the green gabanwent theirs. All this time, Don Diego de Miranda had not spoken a word,being entirely taken up with observing and noting all that Don Quixote didand said, and the opinion he formed was that he was a man of brains gonemad, and a madman on the verge of rationality. The first part of hishistory had not yet reached him, for, had he read it, the amazement withwhich his words and deeds filled him would have vanished, as he would thenhave understood the nature of his madness; but knowing nothing of it, hetook him to be rational one moment, and crazy the next, for what he saidwas sensible, elegant, and well expressed, and what he did, absurd, rash,and foolish; and said he to himself, &ldquo;What could be madder thanputting on a helmet full of curds, and then persuading oneself thatenchanters are softening one&rsquo;s skull; or what could be greaterrashness and folly than wanting to fight lions tooth and nail?&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote roused him from these reflections and this soliloquy bysaying, &ldquo;No doubt, Señor Don Diego de Miranda, you set me down inyour mind as a fool and a madman, and it would be no wonder if you did,for my deeds do not argue anything else. But for all that, I would haveyou take notice that I am neither so mad nor so foolish as I must haveseemed to you. A gallant knight shows to advantage bringing his lance tobear adroitly upon a fierce bull under the eyes of his sovereign, in themidst of a spacious plaza; a knight shows to advantage arrayed inglittering armour, pacing the lists before the ladies in some joyoustournament, and all those knights show to advantage that entertain,divert, and, if we may say so, honour the courts of their princes bywarlike exercises, or what resemble them; but to greater advantage thanall these does a knight-errant show when he traverses deserts, solitudes,cross-roads, forests, and mountains, in quest of perilous adventures, benton bringing them to a happy and successful issue, all to win a gloriousand lasting renown. To greater advantage, I maintain, does theknight-errant show bringing aid to some widow in some lonely waste, thanthe court knight dallying with some city damsel. All knights have theirown special parts to play; let the courtier devote himself to the ladies,let him add lustre to his sovereign&rsquo;s court by his liveries, let himentertain poor gentlemen with the sumptuous fare of his table, let himarrange joustings, marshal tournaments, and prove himself noble, generous,and magnificent, and above all a good Christian, and so doing he willfulfil the duties that are especially his; but let the knight-errantexplore the corners of the earth and penetrate the most intricatelabyrinths, at each step let him attempt impossibilities, on desolateheaths let him endure the burning rays of the midsummer sun, and thebitter inclemency of the winter winds and frosts; let no lions daunt him,no monsters terrify him, no dragons make him quail; for to seek these, toattack those, and to vanquish all, are in truth his main duties. I, then,as it has fallen to my lot to be a member of knight-errantry, cannot avoidattempting all that to me seems to come within the sphere of my duties;thus it was my bounden duty to attack those lions that I just nowattacked, although I knew it to be the height of rashness; for I know wellwhat valour is, that it is a virtue that occupies a place between twovicious extremes, cowardice and temerity; but it will be a lesser evil forhim who is valiant to rise till he reaches the point of rashness, than tosink until he reaches the point of cowardice; for, as it is easier for theprodigal than for the miser to become generous, so it is easier for a rashman to prove truly valiant than for a coward to rise to true valour; andbelieve me, Señor Don Diego, in attempting adventures it is better to loseby a card too many than by a card too few; for to hear it said, &lsquo;sucha knight is rash and daring,&rsquo; sounds better than &lsquo;such aknight is timid and cowardly.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I protest, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; said Don Diego, &ldquo;everythingyou have said and done is proved correct by the test of reason itself; andI believe, if the laws and ordinances of knight-errantry should be lost,they might be found in your worship&rsquo;s breast as in their own properdepository and muniment-house; but let us make haste, and reach myvillage, where you shall take rest after your late exertions; for if theyhave not been of the body they have been of the spirit, and thesesometimes tend to produce bodily fatigue.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I take the invitation as a great favour and honour, Señor DonDiego,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; and pressing forward at a better pacethan before, at about two in the afternoon they reached the village andhouse of Don Diego, or, as Don Quixote called him, &ldquo;The Knight ofthe Green Gaban.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p17e" id="p17e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p17e.jpg (76K)" src="images/p17e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch18b" id="ch18b"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br/>OF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE IN THE CASTLE OR HOUSE OF THE KNIGHT OF THEGREEN GABAN, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS OUT OF THE COMMON</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p18a" id="p18a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p18a.jpg (133K)" src="images/p18a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p18a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote found Don Diego de Miranda&rsquo;s house built in villagestyle, with his arms in rough stone over the street door; in the patio wasthe store-room, and at the entrance the cellar, with plenty of wine-jarsstanding round, which, coming from El Toboso, brought back to his memoryhis enchanted and transformed Dulcinea; and with a sigh, and not thinkingof what he was saying, or in whose presence he was, he exclaimed-</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;O ye sweet treasures, to my sorrow found!<br/>Once sweet and welcome when &rsquo;twas heaven&rsquo;s good-will.<br/><br/>&ldquo;O ye Tobosan jars, how ye bring back to my memory the<br/>sweet object of my bitter regrets!&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p18b" id="p18b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p18b.jpg (300K)" src="images/p18b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p18b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The student poet, Don Diego&rsquo;s son, who had come out with his motherto receive him, heard this exclamation, and both mother and son werefilled with amazement at the extraordinary figure he presented; he,however, dismounting from Rocinante, advanced with great politeness to askpermission to kiss the lady&rsquo;s hand, while Don Diego said, &ldquo;Señora,pray receive with your wonted kindness Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha,whom you see before you, a knight-errant, and the bravest and wisest inthe world.&rdquo;</p><p>The lady, whose name was Doña Christina, received him with every sign ofgood-will and great courtesy, and Don Quixote placed himself at herservice with an abundance of well-chosen and polished phrases. Almost thesame civilities were exchanged between him and the student, who listeningto Don Quixote, took him to be a sensible, clear-headed person.</p><p>Here the author describes minutely everything belonging to Don Diego&rsquo;smansion, putting before us in his picture the whole contents of a richgentleman-farmer&rsquo;s house; but the translator of the history thoughtit best to pass over these and other details of the same sort in silence,as they are not in harmony with the main purpose of the story, the strongpoint of which is truth rather than dull digressions.</p><p>They led Don Quixote into a room, and Sancho removed his armour, leavinghim in loose Walloon breeches and chamois-leather doublet, all stainedwith the rust of his armour; his collar was a falling one of scholasticcut, without starch or lace, his buskins buff-coloured, and his shoespolished. He wore his good sword, which hung in a baldric of sea-wolf&rsquo;sskin, for he had suffered for many years, they say, from an ailment of thekidneys; and over all he threw a long cloak of good grey cloth. But firstof all, with five or six buckets of water (for as regard the number ofbuckets there is some dispute), he washed his head and face, and still thewater remained whey-coloured, thanks to Sancho&rsquo;s greediness andpurchase of those unlucky curds that turned his master so white. Thusarrayed, and with an easy, sprightly, and gallant air, Don Quixote passedout into another room, where the student was waiting to entertain himwhile the table was being laid; for on the arrival of so distinguished aguest, Doña Christina was anxious to show that she knew how and was ableto give a becoming reception to those who came to her house.</p><p>While Don Quixote was taking off his armour, Don Lorenzo (for so Don Diego&rsquo;sson was called) took the opportunity to say to his father, &ldquo;What arewe to make of this gentleman you have brought home to us, sir? For hisname, his appearance, and your describing him as a knight-errant havecompletely puzzled my mother and me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say, my son,&rdquo; replied. Don Diego;&ldquo;all I can tell thee is that I have seen him act the acts of thegreatest madman in the world, and heard him make observations so sensiblethat they efface and undo all he does; do thou talk to him and feel thepulse of his wits, and as thou art shrewd, form the most reasonableconclusion thou canst as to his wisdom or folly; though, to tell thetruth, I am more inclined to take him to be mad than sane.&rdquo;</p><p>With this Don Lorenzo went away to entertain Don Quixote as has been said,and in the course of the conversation that passed between them Don Quixotesaid to Don Lorenzo, &ldquo;Your father, Señor Don Diego de Miranda, hastold me of the rare abilities and subtle intellect you possess, and, aboveall, that you are a great poet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A poet, it may be,&rdquo; replied Don Lorenzo, &ldquo;but a greatone, by no means. It is true that I am somewhat given to poetry and toreading good poets, but not so much so as to justify the title of &lsquo;great&rsquo;which my father gives me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not dislike that modesty,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;forthere is no poet who is not conceited and does not think he is the bestpoet in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no rule without an exception,&rdquo; said Don Lorenzo;&ldquo;there may be some who are poets and yet do not think they are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very few,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but tell me, what versesare those which you have now in hand, and which your father tells me keepyou somewhat restless and absorbed? If it be some gloss, I know somethingabout glosses, and I should like to hear them; and if they are for apoetical tournament, contrive to carry off the second prize; for the firstalways goes by favour or personal standing, the second by simple justice;and so the third comes to be the second, and the first, reckoning in thisway, will be third, in the same way as licentiate degrees are conferred atthe universities; but, for all that, the title of first is a greatdistinction.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So far,&rdquo; said Don Lorenzo to himself, &ldquo;I should nottake you to be a madman; but let us go on.&rdquo; So he said to him,&ldquo;Your worship has apparently attended the schools; what scienceshave you studied?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That of knight-errantry,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;which isas good as that of poetry, and even a finger or two above it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not know what science that is,&rdquo; said Don Lorenzo,&ldquo;and until now I have never heard of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is a science,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that comprehendsin itself all or most of the sciences in the world, for he who professesit must be a jurist, and must know the rules of justice, distributive andequitable, so as to give to each one what belongs to him and is due tohim. He must be a theologian, so as to be able to give a clear anddistinctive reason for the Christian faith he professes, wherever it maybe asked of him. He must be a physician, and above all a herbalist, so asin wastes and solitudes to know the herbs that have the property ofhealing wounds, for a knight-errant must not go looking for someone tocure him at every step. He must be an astronomer, so as to know by thestars how many hours of the night have passed, and what clime and quarterof the world he is in. He must know mathematics, for at every turn someoccasion for them will present itself to him; and, putting it aside thathe must be adorned with all the virtues, cardinal and theological, to comedown to minor particulars, he must, I say, be able to swim as well asNicholas or Nicolao the Fish could, as the story goes; he must know how toshoe a horse, and repair his saddle and bridle; and, to return to highermatters, he must be faithful to God and to his lady; he must be pure inthought, decorous in words, generous in works, valiant in deeds, patientin suffering, compassionate towards the needy, and, lastly, an upholder ofthe truth though its defence should cost him his life. Of all thesequalities, great and small, is a true knight-errant made up; judge then,Señor Don Lorenzo, whether it be a contemptible science which the knightwho studies and professes it has to learn, and whether it may not comparewith the very loftiest that are taught in the schools.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If that be so,&rdquo; replied Don Lorenzo, &ldquo;this science, Iprotest, surpasses all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How, if that be so?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;What I mean to say,&rdquo; said Don Lorenzo, &ldquo;is, that Idoubt whether there are now, or ever were, any knights-errant, and adornedwith such virtues.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Many a time,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;have I said what Inow say once more, that the majority of the world are of opinion thatthere never were any knights-errant in it; and as it is my opinion that,unless heaven by some miracle brings home to them the truth that therewere and are, all the pains one takes will be in vain (as experience hasoften proved to me), I will not now stop to disabuse you of the error youshare with the multitude. All I shall do is to pray to heaven to deliveryou from it, and show you how beneficial and necessary knights-errant werein days of yore, and how useful they would be in these days were they butin vogue; but now, for the sins of the people, sloth and indolence,gluttony and luxury are triumphant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our guest has broken out on our hands,&rdquo; said Don Lorenzo tohimself at this point; &ldquo;but, for all that, he is a glorious madman,and I should be a dull blockhead to doubt it.&rdquo;</p><p>Here, being summoned to dinner, they brought their colloquy to a close.Don Diego asked his son what he had been able to make out as to the witsof their guest. To which he replied, &ldquo;All the doctors and cleverscribes in the world will not make sense of the scrawl of his madness; heis a madman full of streaks, full of lucid intervals.&rdquo;</p><p>They went in to dinner, and the repast was such as Don Diego said on theroad he was in the habit of giving to his guests, neat, plentiful, andtasty; but what pleased Don Quixote most was the marvellous silence thatreigned throughout the house, for it was like a Carthusian monastery.</p><p>When the cloth had been removed, grace said and their hands washed, DonQuixote earnestly pressed Don Lorenzo to repeat to him his verses for thepoetical tournament, to which he replied, &ldquo;Not to be like thosepoets who, when they are asked to recite their verses, refuse, and whenthey are not asked for them vomit them up, I will repeat my gloss, forwhich I do not expect any prize, having composed it merely as an exerciseof ingenuity.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A discerning friend of mine,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;was ofopinion that no one ought to waste labour in glossing verses; and thereason he gave was that the gloss can never come up to the text, and thatoften or most frequently it wanders away from the meaning and purposeaimed at in the glossed lines; and besides, that the laws of the glosswere too strict, as they did not allow interrogations, nor &lsquo;said he,&rsquo;nor &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; nor turning verbs into nouns, or altering theconstruction, not to speak of other restrictions and limitations thatfetter gloss-writers, as you no doubt know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Verily, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; said Don Lorenzo, &ldquo;I wish Icould catch your worship tripping at a stretch, but I cannot, for you slipthrough my fingers like an eel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you say, or mean by slipping,&rdquo;said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;I will explain myself another time,&rdquo; said Don Lorenzo;&ldquo;for the present pray attend to the glossed verses and the gloss,which run thus:</p><p class="poem">Could &lsquo;was&rsquo; become an &lsquo;is&rsquo; for me,<br/>Then would I ask no more than this;<br/>Or could, for me, the time that is<br/>Become the time that is to be!&mdash;<br/><br/><br/><br/>GLOSS<br/><br/>Dame Fortune once upon a day<br/>To me was bountiful and kind;<br/>But all things change; she changed her mind,<br/>And what she gave she took away.<br/>O Fortune, long I&rsquo;ve sued to thee;<br/>The gifts thou gavest me restore,<br/>For, trust me, I would ask no more,<br/>Could &lsquo;was&rsquo; become an &lsquo;is&rsquo; for me.<br/><br/>No other prize I seek to gain,<br/>No triumph, glory, or success,<br/>Only the long-lost happiness,<br/>The memory whereof is pain.<br/>One taste, methinks, of bygone bliss<br/>The heart-consuming fire might stay;<br/>And, so it come without delay,<br/>Then would I ask no more than this.<br/><br/>I ask what cannot be, alas!<br/>That time should ever be, and then<br/>Come back to us, and be again,<br/>No power on earth can bring to pass;<br/>For fleet of foot is he, I wis,<br/>And idly, therefore, do we pray<br/>That what for aye hath left us may<br/>Become for us the time that is.<br/><br/>Perplexed, uncertain, to remain<br/>&rsquo;Twixt hope and fear, is death, not life;<br/>&rsquo;Twere better, sure, to end the strife,<br/>And dying, seek release from pain.<br/>And yet, thought were the best for me.<br/>Anon the thought aside I fling,<br/>And to the present fondly cling,<br/>And dread the time that is to be.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>When Don Lorenzo had finished reciting his gloss, Don Quixote stood up,and in a loud voice, almost a shout, exclaimed as he grasped Don Lorenzo&rsquo;sright hand in his, &ldquo;By the highest heavens, noble youth, but you arethe best poet on earth, and deserve to be crowned with laurel, not byCyprus or by Gaeta&mdash;as a certain poet, God forgive him, said&mdash;butby the Academies of Athens, if they still flourished, and by those thatflourish now, Paris, Bologna, Salamanca. Heaven grant that the judges whorob you of the first prize&mdash;that Phœbus may pierce them with hisarrows, and the Muses never cross the thresholds of their doors. Repeat mesome of your long-measure verses, señor, if you will be so good, for Iwant thoroughly to feel the pulse of your rare genius.&rdquo;</p><p>Is there any need to say that Don Lorenzo enjoyed hearing himself praisedby Don Quixote, albeit he looked upon him as a madman? power of flattery,how far-reaching art thou, and how wide are the bounds of thy pleasantjurisdiction! Don Lorenzo gave a proof of it, for he complied with DonQuixote&rsquo;s request and entreaty, and repeated to him this sonnet onthe fable or story of Pyramus and Thisbe.</p><p class="poem">SONNET<br/><br/>The lovely maid, she pierces now the wall;<br/>Heart-pierced by her young Pyramus doth lie;<br/>And Love spreads wing from Cyprus isle to fly,<br/>A chink to view so wondrous great and small.<br/>There silence speaketh, for no voice at all<br/>Can pass so strait a strait; but love will ply<br/>Where to all other power &rsquo;twere vain to try;<br/>For love will find a way whate&rsquo;er befall.<br/>Impatient of delay, with reckless pace<br/>The rash maid wins the fatal spot where she<br/>Sinks not in lover&rsquo;s arms but death&rsquo;s embrace.<br/>So runs the strange tale, how the lovers twain<br/>One sword, one sepulchre, one memory,<br/>Slays, and entombs, and brings to life again.<br/></p><p>&ldquo;Blessed be God,&rdquo; said Don Quixote when he had heard DonLorenzo&rsquo;s sonnet, &ldquo;that among the hosts there are of irritablepoets I have found one consummate one, which, señor, the art of thissonnet proves to me that you are!&rdquo;</p><p>For four days was Don Quixote most sumptuously entertained in Don Diego&rsquo;shouse, at the end of which time he asked his permission to depart, tellinghim he thanked him for the kindness and hospitality he had received in hishouse, but that, as it did not become knights-errant to give themselves upfor long to idleness and luxury, he was anxious to fulfill the duties ofhis calling in seeking adventures, of which he was informed there was anabundance in that neighbourhood, where he hoped to employ his time untilthe day came round for the jousts at Saragossa, for that was his properdestination; and that, first of all, he meant to enter the cave ofMontesinos, of which so many marvellous things were reported all throughthe country, and at the same time to investigate and explore the originand true source of the seven lakes commonly called the lakes of Ruidera.</p><p>Don Diego and his son commended his laudable resolution, and bade himfurnish himself with all he wanted from their house and belongings, asthey would most gladly be of service to him; which, indeed, his personalworth and his honourable profession made incumbent upon them.</p><p>The day of his departure came at length, as welcome to Don Quixote as itwas sad and sorrowful to Sancho Panza, who was very well satisfied withthe abundance of Don Diego&rsquo;s house, and objected to return to thestarvation of the woods and wilds and the short-commons of his ill-stockedalforjas; these, however, he filled and packed with what he consideredneedful. On taking leave, Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, &ldquo;I knownot whether I have told you already, but if I have I tell you once more,that if you wish to spare yourself fatigue and toil in reaching theinaccessible summit of the temple of fame, you have nothing to do but toturn aside out of the somewhat narrow path of poetry and take the stillnarrower one of knight-errantry, wide enough, however, to make you anemperor in the twinkling of an eye.&rdquo;</p><p>In this speech Don Quixote wound up the evidence of his madness, but stillbetter in what he added when he said, &ldquo;God knows, I would gladlytake Don Lorenzo with me to teach him how to spare the humble, and tramplethe proud under foot, virtues that are part and parcel of the profession Ibelong to; but since his tender age does not allow of it, nor hispraiseworthy pursuits permit it, I will simply content myself withimpressing it upon your worship that you will become famous as a poet ifyou are guided by the opinion of others rather than by your own; becauseno fathers or mothers ever think their own children ill-favoured, and thissort of deception prevails still more strongly in the case of the childrenof the brain.&rdquo;</p><p>Both father and son were amazed afresh at the strange medley Don Quixotetalked, at one moment sense, at another nonsense, and at the pertinacityand persistence he displayed in going through thick and thin in quest ofhis unlucky adventures, which he made the end and aim of his desires.There was a renewal of offers of service and civilities, and then, withthe gracious permission of the lady of the castle, they took theirdeparture, Don Quixote on Rocinante, and Sancho on Dapple.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p18e" id="p18e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p18e.jpg (18K)" src="images/p18e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch19b" id="ch19b"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br/>IN WHICH IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENAMOURED SHEPHERD, TOGETHER WITHOTHER TRULY DROLL INCIDENTS</h3><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p19a.jpg (131K)" src="images/p19a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p19a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote had gone but a short distance beyond Don Diego&rsquo;svillage, when he fell in with a couple of either priests or students, anda couple of peasants, mounted on four beasts of the ass kind. One of thestudents carried, wrapped up in a piece of green buckram by way of aportmanteau, what seemed to be a little linen and a couple of pairs ofribbed stockings; the other carried nothing but a pair of newfencing-foils with buttons. The peasants carried divers articles thatshowed they were on their way from some large town where they had boughtthem, and were taking them home to their village; and both students andpeasants were struck with the same amazement that everybody felt who sawDon Quixote for the first time, and were dying to know who this man, sodifferent from ordinary men, could be. Don Quixote saluted them, and afterascertaining that their road was the same as his, made them an offer ofhis company, and begged them to slacken their pace, as their young assestravelled faster than his horse; and then, to gratify them, he told themin a few words who he was and the calling and profession he followed,which was that of a knight-errant seeking adventures in all parts of theworld. He informed them that his own name was Don Quixote of La Mancha,and that he was called, by way of surname, the Knight of the Lions.</p><p>All this was Greek or gibberish to the peasants, but not so to thestudents, who very soon perceived the crack in Don Quixote&rsquo;s pate;for all that, however, they regarded him with admiration and respect, andone of them said to him, &ldquo;If you, sir knight, have no fixed road, asit is the way with those who seek adventures not to have any, let yourworship come with us; you will see one of the finest and richest weddingsthat up to this day have ever been celebrated in La Mancha, or for many aleague round.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote asked him if it was some prince&rsquo;s, that he spoke of it inthis way. &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the student; &ldquo;it is the weddingof a farmer and a farmer&rsquo;s daughter, he the richest in all this country,and she the fairest mortal ever set eyes on. The display with which it is to beattended will be something rare and out of the common, for it will becelebrated in a meadow adjoining the town of the bride, who is called, <i>parexcellence</i>, Quiteria the fair, as the bridegroom is called Camacho therich. She is eighteen, and he twenty-two, and they are fairly matched, thoughsome knowing ones, who have all the pedigrees in the world by heart, will haveit that the family of the fair Quiteria is better than Camacho&rsquo;s; but noone minds that now-a-days, for wealth can solder a great many flaws. At anyrate, Camacho is free-handed, and it is his fancy to screen the whole meadowwith boughs and cover it in overhead, so that the sun will have hard work if hetries to get in to reach the grass that covers the soil. He has provideddancers too, not only sword but also bell-dancers, for in his own town thereare those who ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection; ofshoe-dancers I say nothing, for of them he has engaged a host. But none ofthese things, nor of the many others I have omitted to mention, will do more tomake this a memorable wedding than the part which I suspect the despairingBasilio will play in it. This Basilio is a youth of the same village asQuiteria, and he lived in the house next door to that of her parents, of whichcircumstance Love took advantage to reproduce to the word the long-forgottenloves of Pyramus and Thisbe; for Basilio loved Quiteria from his earliestyears, and she responded to his passion with countless modest proofs ofaffection, so that the loves of the two children, Basilio and Quiteria, werethe talk and the amusement of the town. As they grew up, the father of Quiteriamade up his mind to refuse Basilio his wonted freedom of access to the house,and to relieve himself of constant doubts and suspicions, he arranged a matchfor his daughter with the rich Camacho, as he did not approve of marrying herto Basilio, who had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature;for if the truth be told ungrudgingly, he is the most agile youth we know, amighty thrower of the bar, a first-rate wrestler, and a great ball-player; heruns like a deer, and leaps better than a goat, bowls over the nine-pins as ifby magic, sings like a lark, plays the guitar so as to make it speak, and,above all, handles a sword as well as the best.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For that excellence alone,&rdquo; said Don Quixote at this, &ldquo;theyouth deserves to marry, not merely the fair Quiteria, but Queen Guinevereherself, were she alive now, in spite of Launcelot and all who would tryto prevent it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say that to my wife,&rdquo; said Sancho, who had until now listenedin silence, &ldquo;for she won&rsquo;t hear of anything but each onemarrying his equal, holding with the proverb &lsquo;each ewe to her like.&rsquo;What I would like is that this good Basilio (for I am beginning to take afancy to him already) should marry this lady Quiteria; and a blessing andgood luck&mdash;I meant to say the opposite&mdash;on people who wouldprevent those who love one another from marrying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If all those who love one another were to marry,&rdquo; said DonQuixote, &ldquo;it would deprive parents of the right to choose, and marrytheir children to the proper person and at the proper time; and if it wasleft to daughters to choose husbands as they pleased, one would be forchoosing her father&rsquo;s servant, and another, someone she has seenpassing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing, though he may be adrunken bully; for love and fancy easily blind the eyes of the judgment,so much wanted in choosing one&rsquo;s way of life; and the matrimonialchoice is very liable to error, and it needs great caution and the specialfavour of heaven to make it a good one. He who has to make a long journey,will, if he is wise, look out for some trusty and pleasant companion toaccompany him before he sets out. Why, then, should not he do the same whohas to make the whole journey of life down to the final halting-place ofdeath, more especially when the companion has to be his companion in bed,at board, and everywhere, as the wife is to her husband? The companionshipof one&rsquo;s wife is no article of merchandise, that, after it has beenbought, may be returned, or bartered, or changed; for it is an inseparableaccident that lasts as long as life lasts; it is a noose that, once youput it round your neck, turns into a Gordian knot, which, if the scythe ofDeath does not cut it, there is no untying. I could say a great deal moreon this subject, were I not prevented by the anxiety I feel to know if theseñor licentiate has anything more to tell about the story of Basilio.&rdquo;</p><p>To this the student, bachelor, or, as Don Quixote called him, licentiate,replied, &ldquo;I have nothing whatever to say further, but that from themoment Basilio learned that the fair Quiteria was to be married to Camachothe rich, he has never been seen to smile, or heard to utter rationalword, and he always goes about moody and dejected, talking to himself in away that shows plainly he is out of his senses. He eats little and sleepslittle, and all he eats is fruit, and when he sleeps, if he sleeps at all,it is in the field on the hard earth like a brute beast. Sometimes hegazes at the sky, at other times he fixes his eyes on the earth in such anabstracted way that he might be taken for a clothed statue, with itsdrapery stirred by the wind. In short, he shows such signs of a heartcrushed by suffering, that all we who know him believe that when to-morrowthe fair Quiteria says &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; it will be his sentence ofdeath.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God will guide it better,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for God whogives the wound gives the salve; nobody knows what will happen; there area good many hours between this and to-morrow, and any one of them, or anymoment, the house may fall; I have seen the rain coming down and the sunshining all at one time; many a one goes to bed in good health who can&rsquo;tstir the next day. And tell me, is there anyone who can boast of havingdriven a nail into the wheel of fortune? No, faith; and between a woman&rsquo;s&lsquo;yes&rsquo; and &lsquo;no&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t venture to put thepoint of a pin, for there would not be room for it; if you tell meQuiteria loves Basilio heart and soul, then I&rsquo;ll give him a bag ofgood luck; for love, I have heard say, looks through spectacles that makecopper seem gold, poverty wealth, and bleary eyes pearls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What art thou driving at, Sancho? curses on thee!&rdquo; said DonQuixote; &ldquo;for when thou takest to stringing proverbs and sayingstogether, no one can understand thee but Judas himself, and I wish he hadthee. Tell me, thou animal, what dost thou know about nails or wheels, oranything else?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, if you don&rsquo;t understand me,&rdquo; replied Sancho,&ldquo;it is no wonder my words are taken for nonsense; but no matter; Iunderstand myself, and I know I have not said anything very foolish inwhat I have said; only your worship, señor, is always gravelling ateverything I say, nay, everything I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cavilling, not gravelling,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;thouprevaricator of honest language, God confound thee!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t find fault with me, your worship,&rdquo; returnedSancho, &ldquo;for you know I have not been bred up at court or trained atSalamanca, to know whether I am adding or dropping a letter or so in mywords. Why! God bless me, it&rsquo;s not fair to force a Sayago-man tospeak like a Toledan; maybe there are Toledans who do not hit it off whenit comes to polished talk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the licentiate, &ldquo;for those who havebeen bred up in the Tanneries and the Zocodover cannot talk like those whoare almost all day pacing the cathedral cloisters, and yet they are allToledans. Pure, correct, elegant and lucid language will be met with inmen of courtly breeding and discrimination, though they may have been bornin Majalahonda; I say of discrimination, because there are many who arenot so, and discrimination is the grammar of good language, if it beaccompanied by practice. I, sirs, for my sins have studied canon law atSalamanca, and I rather pique myself on expressing my meaning in clear,plain, and intelligible language.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you did not pique yourself more on your dexterity with thosefoils you carry than on dexterity of tongue,&rdquo; said the otherstudent, &ldquo;you would have been head of the degrees, where you are nowtail.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look here, bachelor Corchuelo,&rdquo; returned the licentiate,&ldquo;you have the most mistaken idea in the world about skill with thesword, if you think it useless.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is no idea on my part, but an established truth,&rdquo; repliedCorchuelo; &ldquo;and if you wish me to prove it to you by experiment, youhave swords there, and it is a good opportunity; I have a steady hand anda strong arm, and these joined with my resolution, which is not small,will make you confess that I am not mistaken. Dismount and put in practiceyour positions and circles and angles and science, for I hope to make yousee stars at noonday with my rude raw swordsmanship, in which, next toGod, I place my trust that the man is yet to be born who will make me turnmy back, and that there is not one in the world I will not compel to giveground.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As to whether you turn your back or not, I do not concern myself,&rdquo;replied the master of fence; &ldquo;though it might be that your gravewould be dug on the spot where you planted your foot the first time; Imean that you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with thesword.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We shall soon see,&rdquo; replied Corchuelo, and getting off hisass briskly, he drew out furiously one of the swords the licentiatecarried on his beast.</p><p>&ldquo;It must not be that way,&rdquo; said Don Quixote at this point;&ldquo;I will be the director of this fencing match, and judge of thisoften disputed question;&rdquo; and dismounting from Rocinante andgrasping his lance, he planted himself in the middle of the road, just asthe licentiate, with an easy, graceful bearing and step, advanced towardsCorchuelo, who came on against him, darting fire from his eyes, as thesaying is. The other two of the company, the peasants, without dismountingfrom their asses, served as spectators of the mortal tragedy. The cuts,thrusts, down strokes, back strokes and doubles, that Corchuelo deliveredwere past counting, and came thicker than hops or hail. He attacked likean angry lion, but he was met by a tap on the mouth from the button of thelicentiate&rsquo;s sword that checked him in the midst of his furiousonset, and made him kiss it as if it were a relic, though not as devoutlyas relics are and ought to be kissed. The end of it was that thelicentiate reckoned up for him by thrusts every one of the buttons of theshort cassock he wore, tore the skirts into strips, like the tails of acuttlefish, knocked off his hat twice, and so completely tired him out,that in vexation, anger, and rage, he took the sword by the hilt and flungit away with such force, that one of the peasants that were there, who wasa notary, and who went for it, made an affidavit afterwards that he sentit nearly three-quarters of a league, which testimony will serve, and hasserved, to show and establish with all certainty that strength is overcomeby skill.</p><p>Corchuelo sat down wearied, and Sancho approaching him said, &ldquo;By myfaith, señor bachelor, if your worship takes my advice, you will neverchallenge anyone to fence again, only to wrestle and throw the bar, foryou have the youth and strength for that; but as for these fencers as theycall them, I have heard say they can put the point of a sword through theeye of a needle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am satisfied with having tumbled off my donkey,&rdquo; saidCorchuelo, &ldquo;and with having had the truth I was so ignorant ofproved to me by experience;&rdquo; and getting up he embraced thelicentiate, and they were better friends than ever; and not caring to waitfor the notary who had gone for the sword, as they saw he would be a longtime about it, they resolved to push on so as to reach the village ofQuiteria, to which they all belonged, in good time.</p><p>During the remainder of the journey the licentiate held forth to them onthe excellences of the sword, with such conclusive arguments, and suchfigures and mathematical proofs, that all were convinced of the value ofthe science, and Corchuelo cured of his dogmatism.</p><p>It grew dark; but before they reached the town it seemed to them all as ifthere was a heaven full of countless glittering stars in front of it. Theyheard, too, the pleasant mingled notes of a variety of instruments,flutes, drums, psalteries, pipes, tabors, and timbrels, and as they drewnear they perceived that the trees of a leafy arcade that had beenconstructed at the entrance of the town were filled with lights unaffectedby the wind, for the breeze at the time was so gentle that it had notpower to stir the leaves on the trees. The musicians were the life of thewedding, wandering through the pleasant grounds in separate bands, somedancing, others singing, others playing the various instruments alreadymentioned. In short, it seemed as though mirth and gaiety were friskingand gambolling all over the meadow. Several other persons were engaged inerecting raised benches from which people might conveniently see the playsand dances that were to be performed the next day on the spot dedicated tothe celebration of the marriage of Camacho the rich and the obsequies ofBasilio. Don Quixote would not enter the village, although the peasant aswell as the bachelor pressed him; he excused himself, however, on thegrounds, amply sufficient in his opinion, that it was the custom ofknights-errant to sleep in the fields and woods in preference to towns,even were it under gilded ceilings; and so turned aside a little out ofthe road, very much against Sancho&rsquo;s will, as the good quarters hehad enjoyed in the castle or house of Don Diego came back to his mind.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p19e" id="p19e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p19e.jpg (29K)" src="images/p19e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch20b" id="ch20b"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br/>WHEREIN AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE WEDDING OF CAMACHO THE RICH, TOGETHERWITH THE INCIDENT OF BASILIO THE POOR</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p20a" id="p20a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p20a.jpg (125K)" src="images/p20a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p20a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Scarce had the fair Aurora given bright Phœbus time to dry the liquidpearls upon her golden locks with the heat of his fervent rays, when DonQuixote, shaking off sloth from his limbs, sprang to his feet and calledto his squire Sancho, who was still snoring; seeing which Don Quixote erehe roused him thus addressed him: &ldquo;Happy thou, above all thedwellers on the face of the earth, that, without envying or being envied,sleepest with tranquil mind, and that neither enchanters persecute norenchantments affright. Sleep, I say, and will say a hundred times, withoutany jealous thoughts of thy mistress to make thee keep ceaseless vigils,or any cares as to how thou art to pay the debts thou owest, or findto-morrow&rsquo;s food for thyself and thy needy little family, tointerfere with thy repose. Ambition breaks not thy rest, nor doth thisworld&rsquo;s empty pomp disturb thee, for the utmost reach of thy anxietyis to provide for thy ass, since upon my shoulders thou hast laid thesupport of thyself, the counterpoise and burden that nature and customhave imposed upon masters. The servant sleeps and the master lies awakethinking how he is to feed him, advance him, and reward him. The distressof seeing the sky turn brazen, and withhold its needful moisture from theearth, is not felt by the servant but by the master, who in time ofscarcity and famine must support him who has served him in times of plentyand abundance.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p20b" id="p20b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p20b.jpg (365K)" src="images/p20b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p20b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>To all this Sancho made no reply because he was asleep, nor would he havewakened up so soon as he did had not Don Quixote brought him to his senseswith the butt of his lance. He awoke at last, drowsy and lazy, and castinghis eyes about in every direction, observed, &ldquo;There comes, if I don&rsquo;tmistake, from the quarter of that arcade a steam and a smell a great dealmore like fried rashers than galingale or thyme; a wedding that beginswith smells like that, by my faith, ought to be plentiful and unstinting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have done, thou glutton,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;come, letus go and witness this bridal, and see what the rejected Basilio does.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let him do what he likes,&rdquo; returned Sancho; &ldquo;be he notpoor, he would marry Quiteria. To make a grand match for himself, and hewithout a farthing; is there nothing else? Faith, señor, it&rsquo;s myopinion the poor man should be content with what he can get, and not golooking for dainties in the bottom of the sea. I will bet my arm thatCamacho could bury Basilio in reals; and if that be so, as no doubt it is,what a fool Quiteria would be to refuse the fine dresses and jewelsCamacho must have given her and will give her, and take Basilio&rsquo;sbar-throwing and sword-play. They won&rsquo;t give a pint of wine at thetavern for a good cast of the bar or a neat thrust of the sword. Talentsand accomplishments that can&rsquo;t be turned into money, let CountDirlos have them; but when such gifts fall to one that has hard cash, Iwish my condition of life was as becoming as they are. On a goodfoundation you can raise a good building, and the best foundation in theworld is money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote here, &ldquo;stopthat harangue; it is my belief, if thou wert allowed to continue all thoubeginnest every instant, thou wouldst have no time left for eating orsleeping; for thou wouldst spend it all in talking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If your worship had a good memory,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;youwould remember the articles of our agreement before we started from homethis last time; one of them was that I was to be let say all I liked, solong as it was not against my neighbour or your worship&rsquo;s authority;and so far, it seems to me, I have not broken the said article.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I remember no such article, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;and even if it were so, I desire you to hold your tongue and comealong; for the instruments we heard last night are already beginning toenliven the valleys again, and no doubt the marriage will take place inthe cool of the morning, and not in the heat of the afternoon.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho did as his master bade him, and putting the saddle on Rocinante andthe pack-saddle on Dapple, they both mounted and at a leisurely paceentered the arcade. The first thing that presented itself to Sancho&rsquo;seyes was a whole ox spitted on a whole elm tree, and in the fire at whichit was to be roasted there was burning a middling-sized mountain offaggots, and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had not been made inthe ordinary mould of common pots, for they were six half wine-jars, eachfit to hold the contents of a slaughter-house; they swallowed up wholesheep and hid them away in their insides without showing any more sign ofthem than if they were pigeons. Countless were the hares ready skinned andthe plucked fowls that hung on the trees for burial in the pots,numberless the wildfowl and game of various sorts suspended from thebranches that the air might keep them cool. Sancho counted more than sixtywine skins of over six gallons each, and all filled, as it provedafterwards, with generous wines. There were, besides, piles of the whitestbread, like the heaps of corn one sees on the threshing-floors. There wasa wall made of cheeses arranged like open brick-work, and two cauldronsfull of oil, bigger than those of a dyer&rsquo;s shop, served for cookingfritters, which when fried were taken out with two mighty shovels, andplunged into another cauldron of prepared honey that stood close by. Ofcooks and cook-maids there were over fifty, all clean, brisk, and blithe.In the capacious belly of the ox were a dozen soft little sucking-pigs,which, sewn up there, served to give it tenderness and flavour.

Thefirst to captivate and take his fancy were the pots, out of which he wouldhave very gladly helped himself to a moderate pipkinful; then the wineskins secured his affections; and lastly, the produce of the frying-pans,if, indeed, such imposing cauldrons may be called frying-pans; and unableto control himself or bear it any longer, he approached one of the busycooks and civilly but hungrily begged permission to soak a scrap of breadin one of the pots; to which the cook made answer, &ldquo;Brother, this isnot a day on which hunger is to have any sway, thanks to the rich Camacho;get down and look about for a ladle and skim off a hen or two, and muchgood may they do you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see one,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; said the cook; &ldquo;sinner that I am! howparticular and bashful you are!&rdquo; and so saying, he seized a bucketand plunging it into one of the half jars took up three hens and a coupleof geese, and said to Sancho, &ldquo;Fall to, friend, and take the edgeoff your appetite with these skimmings until dinner-time comes.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p20d" id="p20d"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p20d.jpg (351K)" src="images/p20d.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p20d.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;I have nothing to put them in,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said the cook, &ldquo;take spoon and all; forCamacho&rsquo;s wealth and happiness furnish everything.&rdquo;</p><p>While Sancho fared thus, Don Quixote was watching the entrance, at one endof the arcade, of some twelve peasants, all in holiday and gala dress,mounted on twelve beautiful mares with rich handsome field trappings and anumber of little bells attached to their petrals, who, marshalled inregular order, ran not one but several courses over the meadow, withjubilant shouts and cries of &ldquo;Long live Camacho and Quiteria! he asrich as she is fair; and she the fairest on earth!&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing this, Don Quixote said to himself, &ldquo;It is easy to see thesefolk have never seen my Dulcinea del Toboso; for if they had they would bemore moderate in their praises of this Quiteria of theirs.&rdquo;</p><p>Shortly after this, several bands of dancers of various sorts began toenter the arcade at different points, and among them one of sword-dancerscomposed of some four-and-twenty lads of gallant and high-spirited mien,clad in the finest and whitest of linen, and with handkerchiefsembroidered in various colours with fine silk; and one of those on themares asked an active youth who led them if any of the dancers had beenwounded. &ldquo;As yet, thank God, no one has been wounded,&rdquo; saidhe, &ldquo;we are all safe and sound;&rdquo; and he at once began toexecute complicated figures with the rest of his comrades, with so manyturns and so great dexterity, that although Don Quixote was well used tosee dances of the same kind, he thought he had never seen any so good asthis. He also admired another that came in composed of fair young maidens,none of whom seemed to be under fourteen or over eighteen years of age,all clad in green stuff, with their locks partly braided, partly flowingloose, but all of such bright gold as to vie with the sunbeams, and overthem they wore garlands of jessamine, roses, amaranth, and honeysuckle. Attheir head were a venerable old man and an ancient dame, more brisk andactive, however, than might have been expected from their years. The notesof a Zamora bagpipe accompanied them, and with modesty in theircountenances and in their eyes, and lightness in their feet, they lookedthe best dancers in the world.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p20e" id="p20e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p20e.jpg (361K)" src="images/p20e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p20e.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Following these there came an artistic dance of the sort they call &ldquo;speakingdances.&rdquo; It was composed of eight nymphs in two files, with the godCupid leading one and Interest the other, the former furnished with wings,bow, quiver and arrows, the latter in a rich dress of gold and silk ofdivers colours. The nymphs that followed Love bore their names written onwhite parchment in large letters on their backs. &ldquo;Poetry&rdquo; wasthe name of the first, &ldquo;Wit&rdquo; of the second, &ldquo;Birth&rdquo;of the third, and &ldquo;Valour&rdquo; of the fourth. Those that followedInterest were distinguished in the same way; the badge of the firstannounced &ldquo;Liberality,&rdquo; that of the second &ldquo;Largess,&rdquo;the third &ldquo;Treasure,&rdquo; and the fourth &ldquo;PeacefulPossession.&rdquo; In front of them all came a wooden castle drawn by fourwild men, all clad in ivy and hemp stained green, and looking so naturalthat they nearly terrified Sancho. On the front of the castle and on eachof the four sides of its frame it bore the inscription &ldquo;Castle ofCaution.&rdquo; Four skillful tabor and flute players accompanied them,and the dance having been opened, Cupid, after executing two figures,raised his eyes and bent his bow against a damsel who stood between theturrets of the castle, and thus addressed her:</p><p class="poem">I am the mighty God whose sway<br/>Is potent over land and sea.<br/>The heavens above us own me; nay,<br/>The shades below acknowledge me.<br/>I know not fear, I have my will,<br/>Whate&rsquo;er my whim or fancy be;<br/>For me there&rsquo;s no impossible,<br/>I order, bind, forbid, set free.</p><p>Having concluded the stanza he discharged an arrow at the top of thecastle, and went back to his place. Interest then came forward and wentthrough two more figures, and as soon as the tabors ceased, he said:</p><p class="poem">But mightier than Love am I,<br/>Though Love it be that leads me on,<br/>Than mine no lineage is more high,<br/>Or older, underneath the sun.<br/>To use me rightly few know how,<br/>To act without me fewer still,<br/>For I am Interest, and I vow<br/>For evermore to do thy will.</p><p>Interest retired, and Poetry came forward, and when she had gone throughher figures like the others, fixing her eyes on the damsel of the castle,she said:</p><p class="poem">With many a fanciful conceit,<br/>Fair Lady, winsome Poesy<br/>Her soul, an offering at thy feet,<br/>Presents in sonnets unto thee.<br/>If thou my homage wilt not scorn,<br/>Thy fortune, watched by envious eyes,<br/>On wings of poesy upborne<br/>Shall be exalted to the skies.</p><p>Poetry withdrew, and on the side of Interest Liberality advanced, andafter having gone through her figures, said:</p><p class="poem">To give, while shunning each extreme,<br/>The sparing hand, the over-free,<br/>Therein consists, so wise men deem,<br/>The virtue Liberality.<br/>But thee, fair lady, to enrich,<br/>Myself a prodigal I&rsquo;ll prove,<br/>A vice not wholly shameful, which<br/>May find its fair excuse in love.</p><p>In the same manner all the characters of the two bands advanced andretired, and each executed its figures, and delivered its verses, some ofthem graceful, some burlesque, but Don Quixote&rsquo;s memory (though hehad an excellent one) only carried away those that have been just quoted.All then mingled together, forming chains and breaking off again withgraceful, unconstrained gaiety; and whenever Love passed in front of thecastle he shot his arrows up at it, while Interest broke gilded pelletsagainst it. At length, after they had danced a good while, Interest drewout a great purse, made of the skin of a large brindled cat and to allappearance full of money, and flung it at the castle, and with the forceof the blow the boards fell asunder and tumbled down, leaving the damselexposed and unprotected. Interest and the characters of his band advanced,and throwing a great chain of gold over her neck pretended to take her andlead her away captive, on seeing which, Love and his supporters made asthough they would release her, the whole action being to the accompanimentof the tabors and in the form of a regular dance. The wild men made peacebetween them, and with great dexterity readjusted and fixed the boards ofthe castle, and the damsel once more ensconced herself within; and withthis the dance wound up, to the great enjoyment of the beholders.</p><p>Don Quixote asked one of the nymphs who it was that had composed andarranged it. She replied that it was a beneficiary of the town who had anice taste in devising things of the sort. &ldquo;I will lay a wager,&rdquo;said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that the same bachelor or beneficiary is agreater friend of Camacho&rsquo;s than of Basilio&rsquo;s, and that he isbetter at satire than at vespers; he has introduced the accomplishments ofBasilio and the riches of Camacho very neatly into the dance.&rdquo;Sancho Panza, who was listening to all this, exclaimed, &ldquo;The king ismy cock; I stick to Camacho.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is easy to see thou art aclown, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and one of that sort thatcry &lsquo;Long life to the conqueror.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of what sort I am,&rdquo; returned Sancho,&ldquo;but I know very well I&rsquo;ll never get such elegant skimmingsoff Basilio&rsquo;s pots as these I have got off Camacho&rsquo;s;&rdquo;and he showed him the bucketful of geese and hens, and seizing one beganto eat with great gaiety and appetite, saying, &ldquo;A fig for theaccomplishments of Basilio! As much as thou hast so much art thou worth,and as much as thou art worth so much hast thou. As a grandmother of mineused to say, there are only two families in the world, the Haves and theHaven&rsquo;ts; and she stuck to the Haves; and to this day, Señor DonQuixote, people would sooner feel the pulse of &lsquo;Have,&rsquo; than of&lsquo;Know;&rsquo; an ass covered with gold looks better than a horsewith a pack-saddle. So once more I say I stick to Camacho, the bountifulskimmings of whose pots are geese and hens, hares and rabbits; but ofBasilio&rsquo;s, if any ever come to hand, or even to foot, they&rsquo;llbe only rinsings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hast thou finished thy harangue, Sancho?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.&ldquo;Of course I have finished it,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;becauseI see your worship takes offence at it; but if it was not for that, therewas work enough cut out for three days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God grant I may see thee dumb before I die, Sancho,&rdquo; said DonQuixote.</p><p>&ldquo;At the rate we are going,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bechewing clay before your worship dies; and then, maybe, I&rsquo;ll be sodumb that I&rsquo;ll not say a word until the end of the world, or, atleast, till the day of judgment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even should that happen, O Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;thysilence will never come up to all thou hast talked, art talking, and wilttalk all thy life; moreover, it naturally stands to reason, that my deathwill come before thine; so I never expect to see thee dumb, not even whenthou art drinking or sleeping, and that is the utmost I can say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In good faith, señor,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;there&rsquo;sno trusting that fleshless one, I mean Death, who devours the lamb as soonas the sheep, and, as I have heard our curate say, treads with equal footupon the lofty towers of kings and the lowly huts of the poor. That ladyis more mighty than dainty, she is in no way squeamish, she devours all andis ready for all, and fills her alforjas with people of all sorts, ages,and ranks. She is no reaper that sleeps out the noontide; at all times sheis reaping and cutting down, as well the dry grass as the green; she neverseems to chew, but bolts and swallows all that is put before her, for shehas a canine appetite that is never satisfied; and though she has nobelly, she shows she has a dropsy and is athirst to drink the lives of allthat live, as one would drink a jug of cold water.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say no more, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote at this; &ldquo;don&rsquo;ttry to better it, and risk a fall; for in truth what thou hast said aboutdeath in thy rustic phrase is what a good preacher might have said. I tellthee, Sancho, if thou hadst discretion equal to thy mother wit, thoumightst take a pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching finesermons.&rdquo; &ldquo;He preaches well who lives well,&rdquo; saidSancho, &ldquo;and I know no more theology than that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nor needst thou,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;but I cannotconceive or make out how it is that, the fear of God being the beginningof wisdom, thou, who art more afraid of a lizard than of him, knowest somuch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pass judgment on your chivalries, señor,&rdquo; returned Sancho,&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t set yourself up to judge of other men&rsquo;s fearsor braveries, for I am as good a fearer of God as my neighbours; but leaveme to despatch these skimmings, for all the rest is only idle talk that weshall be called to account for in the other world;&rdquo; and so saying,he began a fresh attack on the bucket, with such a hearty appetite that hearoused Don Quixote&rsquo;s, who no doubt would have helped him had he notbeen prevented by what must be told farther on.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p20f" id="p20f"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p20f.jpg (41K)" src="images/p20f.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch21b" id="ch21b"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br/>IN WHICH CAMACHO&rsquo;S WEDDING IS CONTINUED, WITH OTHER DELIGHTFULINCIDENTS</h3><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p21a" id="p21a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p21a.jpg (118K)" src="images/p21a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p21a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>While Don Quixote and Sancho were engaged in the discussion set forth thelast chapter, they heard loud shouts and a great noise, which were utteredand made by the men on the mares as they went at full gallop, shouting, toreceive the bride and bridegroom, who were approaching with musicalinstruments and pageantry of all sorts around them, and accompanied by thepriest and the relatives of both, and all the most distinguished people ofthe surrounding villages. When Sancho saw the bride, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Bymy faith, she is not dressed like a country girl, but like some fine courtlady; egad, as well as I can make out, the patena she wears rich coral,and her green Cuenca stuff is thirty-pile velvet; and then the white linentrimming&mdash;by my oath, but it&rsquo;s satin! Look at her hands&mdash;jetrings on them! May I never have luck if they&rsquo;re not gold rings, andreal gold, and set with pearls as white as a curdled milk, and every oneof them worth an eye of one&rsquo;s head! Whoreson baggage, what hair shehas! if it&rsquo;s not a wig, I never saw longer or fairer all the days ofmy life. See how bravely she bears herself&mdash;and her shape! Wouldn&rsquo;tyou say she was like a walking palm tree loaded with clusters of dates?for the trinkets she has hanging from her hair and neck look just likethem. I swear in my heart she is a brave lass, and fit &lsquo;to pass overthe banks of Flanders.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote laughed at Sancho&rsquo;s boorish eulogies and thought that,saving his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he had never seen a more beautifulwoman. The fair Quiteria appeared somewhat pale, which was, no doubt,because of the bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out fortheir wedding on the morrow. They advanced towards a theatre that stood onone side of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs, where they were toplight their troth, and from which they were to behold the dances andplays; but at the moment of their arrival at the spot they heard a loudoutcry behind them, and a voice exclaiming, &ldquo;Wait a little, ye, asinconsiderate as ye are hasty!&rdquo; At these words all turned round, andperceived that the speaker was a man clad in what seemed to be a looseblack coat garnished with crimson patches like flames. He was crowned (aswas presently seen) with a crown of gloomy cypress, and in his hand heheld a long staff. As he approached he was recognised by everyone as thegay Basilio, and all waited anxiously to see what would come of his words,in dread of some catastrophe in consequence of his appearance at such amoment. He came up at last weary and breathless, and planting himself infront of the bridal pair, drove his staff, which had a steel spike at theend, into the ground, and, with a pale face and eyes fixed on Quiteria, hethus addressed her in a hoarse, trembling voice:</p><p>&ldquo;Well dost thou know, ungrateful Quiteria, that according to theholy law we acknowledge, so long as live thou canst take no husband; norart thou ignorant either that, in my hopes that time and my own exertionswould improve my fortunes, I have never failed to observe the respect dueto thy honour; but thou, casting behind thee all thou owest to my truelove, wouldst surrender what is mine to another whose wealth serves tobring him not only good fortune but supreme happiness; and now to completeit (not that I think he deserves it, but inasmuch as heaven is pleased tobestow it upon him), I will, with my own hands, do away with the obstaclethat may interfere with it, and remove myself from between you. Long livethe rich Camacho! many a happy year may he live with the ungratefulQuiteria! and let the poor Basilio die, Basilio whose poverty clipped thewings of his happiness, and brought him to the grave!&rdquo;</p><p>And so saying, he seized the staff he had driven into the ground, andleaving one half of it fixed there, showed it to be a sheath thatconcealed a tolerably long rapier; and, what may be called its hilt beingplanted in the ground, he swiftly, coolly, and deliberately threw himselfupon it, and in an instant the bloody point and half the steel bladeappeared at his back, the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed in hisblood, and transfixed by his own weapon.</p><p>His friends at once ran to his aid, filled with grief at his misery andsad fate, and Don Quixote, dismounting from Rocinante, hastened to supporthim, and took him in his arms, and found he had not yet ceased to breathe.They were about to draw out the rapier, but the priest who was standing byobjected to its being withdrawn before he had confessed him, as theinstant of its withdrawal would be that of this death. Basilio, however,reviving slightly, said in a weak voice, as though in pain, &ldquo;If thouwouldst consent, cruel Quiteria, to give me thy hand as my bride in thislast fatal moment, I might still hope that my rashness would find pardon,as by its means I attained the bliss of being thine.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing this the priest bade him think of the welfare of his soul ratherthan of the cravings of the body, and in all earnestness implore God&rsquo;spardon for his sins and for his rash resolve; to which Basilio repliedthat he was determined not to confess unless Quiteria first gave him herhand in marriage, for that happiness would compose his mind and give himcourage to make his confession.</p><p>Don Quixote hearing the wounded man&rsquo;s entreaty, exclaimed aloud thatwhat Basilio asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request thatmight be easily complied with; and that it would be as much to SeñorCamacho&rsquo;s honour to receive the lady Quiteria as the widow of thebrave Basilio as if he received her direct from her father.</p><p>&ldquo;In this case,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it will be only to say &lsquo;yes,&rsquo;and no consequences can follow the utterance of the word, for the nuptialcouch of this marriage must be the grave.&rdquo;</p><p>Camacho was listening to all this, perplexed and bewildered and notknowing what to say or do; but so urgent were the entreaties of Basilio&rsquo;sfriends, imploring him to allow Quiteria to give him her hand, so that hissoul, quitting this life in despair, should not be lost, that they moved,nay, forced him, to say that if Quiteria were willing to give it he wassatisfied, as it was only putting off the fulfillment of his wishes for amoment. At once all assailed Quiteria and pressed her, some with prayers,and others with tears, and others with persuasive arguments, to give herhand to poor Basilio; but she, harder than marble and more unmoved thanany statue, seemed unable or unwilling to utter a word, nor would she havegiven any reply had not the priest bade her decide quickly what she meantto do, as Basilio now had his soul at his teeth, and there was no time forhesitation.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p21b" id="p21b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p21b.jpg (374K)" src="images/p21b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p21b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>On this the fair Quiteria, to all appearance distressed, grieved, andrepentant, advanced without a word to where Basilio lay, his eyes alreadyturned in his head, his breathing short and painful, murmuring the name ofQuiteria between his teeth, and apparently about to die like a heathen andnot like a Christian. Quiteria approached him, and kneeling, demanded hishand by signs without speaking. Basilio opened his eyes and gazing fixedlyat her, said, &ldquo;O Quiteria, why hast thou turned compassionate at amoment when thy compassion will serve as a dagger to rob me of life, for Ihave not now the strength left either to bear the happiness thou givest mein accepting me as thine, or to suppress the pain that is rapidly drawingthe dread shadow of death over my eyes? What I entreat of thee, O thoufatal star to me, is that the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst giveme, be not given out of complaisance or to deceive me afresh, but thatthou confess and declare that without any constraint upon thy will thougivest it to me as to thy lawful husband; for it is not meet that thoushouldst trifle with me at such a moment as this, or have recourse tofalsehoods with one who has dealt so truly by thee.&rdquo;</p><p>While uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystandersexpected each return of faintness would take his life with it. ThenQuiteria, overcome with modesty and shame, holding in her right hand thehand of Basilio, said, &ldquo;No force would bend my will; as freely,therefore, as it is possible for me to do so, I give thee the hand of alawful wife, and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own freewill, untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has broughtupon thee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I give it,&rdquo; said Basilio, &ldquo;not agitated ordistracted, but with unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant me,thus do I give myself to be thy husband.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I give myself to be thy wife,&rdquo; said Quiteria, &ldquo;whetherthou livest many years, or they carry thee from my arms to the grave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For one so badly wounded,&rdquo; observed Sancho at this point,&ldquo;this young man has a great deal to say; they should make him leaveoff billing and cooing, and attend to his soul; for to my thinking he hasit more on his tongue than at his teeth.&rdquo;</p><p>Basilio and Quiteria having thus joined hands, the priest, deeply movedand with tears in his eyes, pronounced the blessing upon them, andimplored heaven to grant an easy passage to the soul of the newly weddedman, who, the instant he received the blessing, started nimbly to his feetand with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that had beensheathed in his body. All the bystanders were astounded, and some, moresimple than inquiring, began shouting, &ldquo;A miracle, a miracle!&rdquo;But Basilio replied, &ldquo;No miracle, no miracle; only a trick, a trick!&rdquo;The priest, perplexed and amazed, made haste to examine the wound withboth hands, and found that the blade had passed, not through Basilio&rsquo;sflesh and ribs, but through a hollow iron tube full of blood, which he hadadroitly fixed at the place, the blood, as was afterwards ascertained,having been so prepared as not to congeal. In short, the priest andCamacho and most of those present saw they were tricked and made fools of.The bride showed no signs of displeasure at the deception; on thecontrary, hearing them say that the marriage, being fraudulent, would notbe valid, she said that she confirmed it afresh, whence they all concludedthat the affair had been planned by agreement and understanding betweenthe pair, whereat Camacho and his supporters were so mortified that theyproceeded to revenge themselves by violence, and a great number of themdrawing their swords attacked Basilio, in whose protection as many moreswords were in an instant unsheathed, while Don Quixote taking the lead onhorseback, with his lance over his arm and well covered with his shield,made all give way before him. Sancho, who never found any pleasure orenjoyment in such doings, retreated to the wine-jars from which he hadtaken his delectable skimmings, considering that, as a holy place, thatspot would be respected.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold, sirs, hold!&rdquo; cried Don Quixote in a loud voice; &ldquo;wehave no right to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us:remember love and war are the same thing, and as in war it is allowableand common to make use of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy, soin the contests and rivalries of love the tricks and devices employed toattain the desired end are justifiable, provided they be not to thediscredit or dishonour of the loved object. Quiteria belonged to Basilioand Basilio to Quiteria by the just and beneficent disposal of heaven.Camacho is rich, and can purchase his pleasure when, where, and as itpleases him. Basilio has but this ewe-lamb, and no one, however powerfulhe may be, shall take her from him; these two whom God hath joined mancannot separate; and he who attempts it must first pass the point of thislance;&rdquo; and so saying he brandished it so stoutly and dexterouslythat he overawed all who did not know him.</p><p>But so deep an impression had the rejection of Quiteria made on Camacho&rsquo;smind that it banished her at once from his thoughts; and so the counselsof the priest, who was a wise and kindly disposed man, prevailed with him,and by their means he and his partisans were pacified and tranquillised,and to prove it put up their swords again, inveighing against the pliancyof Quiteria rather than the craftiness of Basilio; Camacho maintainingthat, if Quiteria as a maiden had such a love for Basilio, she would haveloved him too as a married woman, and that he ought to thank heaven morefor having taken her than for having given her.</p><p>Camacho and those of his following, therefore, being consoled andpacified, those on Basilio&rsquo;s side were appeased; and the richCamacho, to show that he felt no resentment for the trick, and did notcare about it, desired the festival to go on just as if he were married inreality. Neither Basilio, however, nor his bride, nor their followerswould take any part in it, and they withdrew to Basilio&rsquo;s village;for the poor, if they are persons of virtue and good sense, have those whofollow, honour, and uphold them, just as the rich have those who flatterand dance attendance on them. With them they carried Don Quixote,regarding him as a man of worth and a stout one. Sancho alone had a cloudon his soul, for he found himself debarred from waiting for Camacho&rsquo;ssplendid feast and festival, which lasted until night; and thus draggedaway, he moodily followed his master, who accompanied Basilio&rsquo;sparty, and left behind him the flesh-pots of Egypt; though in his heart hetook them with him, and their now nearly finished skimmings that hecarried in the bucket conjured up visions before his eyes of the glory andabundance of the good cheer he was losing. And so, vexed and dejectedthough not hungry, without dismounting from Dapple he followed in thefootsteps of Rocinante.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p21c" id="p21c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p21c.jpg (417K)" src="images/p21c.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p21c.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p21e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p21e.jpg (49K)" src="images/p21e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch22b" id="ch22b"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br/>WHEREIN IS RELATED THE GRAND ADVENTURE OF THE CAVE OF MONTESINOS IN THEHEART OF LA MANCHA, WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE BROUGHT TO A HAPPYTERMINATION</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p22a" id="p22a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p22a.jpg (112K)" src="images/p22a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p22a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Many and great were the attentions shown to Don Quixote by the newlymarried couple, who felt themselves under an obligation to him for comingforward in defence of their cause; and they exalted his wisdom to the samelevel with his courage, rating him as a Cid in arms, and a Cicero ineloquence. Worthy Sancho enjoyed himself for three days at the expense ofthe pair, from whom they learned that the sham wound was not a schemearranged with the fair Quiteria, but a device of Basilio&rsquo;s, whocounted on exactly the result they had seen; he confessed, it is true,that he had confided his idea to some of his friends, so that at theproper time they might aid him in his purpose and insure the success ofthe deception.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p22b" id="p22b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p22b.jpg (344K)" src="images/p22b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p22b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;is not and ought not to becalled deception which aims at virtuous ends;&rdquo; and the marriage oflovers he maintained to be a most excellent end, reminding them, however,that love has no greater enemy than hunger and constant want; for love isall gaiety, enjoyment, and happiness, especially when the lover is in thepossession of the object of his love, and poverty and want are thedeclared enemies of all these; which he said to urge Señor Basilio toabandon the practice of those accomplishments he was skilled in, forthough they brought him fame, they brought him no money, and apply himselfto the acquisition of wealth by legitimate industry, which will never failthose who are prudent and persevering. The poor man who is a man of honour(if indeed a poor man can be a man of honour) has a jewel when he has afair wife, and if she is taken from him, his honour is taken from him andslain. The fair woman who is a woman of honour, and whose husband is poor,deserves to be crowned with the laurels and crowns of victory and triumph.Beauty by itself attracts the desires of all who behold it, and the royaleagles and birds of towering flight stoop on it as on a dainty lure; butif beauty be accompanied by want and penury, then the ravens and the kitesand other birds of prey assail it, and she who stands firm against suchattacks well deserves to be called the crown of her husband. &ldquo;Remember,O prudent Basilio,&rdquo; added Don Quixote, &ldquo;it was the opinion ofa certain sage, I know not whom, that there was not more than one goodwoman in the whole world; and his advice was that each one should thinkand believe that this one good woman was his own wife, and in this way hewould live happy. I myself am not married, nor, so far, has it everentered my thoughts to be so; nevertheless I would venture to give adviceto anyone who might ask it, as to the mode in which he should seek a wifesuch as he would be content to marry. The first thing I would recommendhim, would be to look to good name rather than to wealth, for a good womandoes not win a good name merely by being good, but by letting it be seenthat she is so, and open looseness and freedom do much more damage to awoman&rsquo;s honour than secret depravity. If you take a good woman intoyour house it will be an easy matter to keep her good, and even to makeher still better; but if you take a bad one you will find it hard work tomend her, for it is no very easy matter to pass from one extreme toanother. I do not say it is impossible, but I look upon it as difficult.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho, listening to all this, said to himself, &ldquo;This master ofmine, when I say anything that has weight and substance, says I might takea pulpit in hand, and go about the world preaching fine sermons; but I sayof him that, when he begins stringing maxims together and giving advicenot only might he take a pulpit in hand, but two on each finger, and gointo the market-places to his heart&rsquo;s content. Devil take you for aknight-errant, what a lot of things you know! I used to think in my heartthat the only thing he knew was what belonged to his chivalry; but thereis nothing he won&rsquo;t have a finger in.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho muttered this somewhat aloud, and his master overheard him, andasked, &ldquo;What art thou muttering there, Sancho?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying anything or muttering anything,&rdquo; saidSancho; &ldquo;I was only saying to myself that I wish I had heard whatyour worship has said just now before I married; perhaps I&rsquo;d saynow, &lsquo;The ox that&rsquo;s loose licks himself well.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is thy Teresa so bad then, Sancho?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is not very bad,&rdquo; replied Sancho; &ldquo;but she is notvery good; at least she is not as good as I could wish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou dost wrong, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;to speakill of thy wife; for after all she is the mother of thy children.&rdquo;&ldquo;We are quits,&rdquo; returned Sancho; &ldquo;for she speaks ill ofme whenever she takes it into her head, especially when she is jealous;and Satan himself could not put up with her then.&rdquo;</p><p>In fine, they remained three days with the newly married couple, by whomthey were entertained and treated like kings. Don Quixote begged thefencing licentiate to find him a guide to show him the way to the cave ofMontesinos, as he had a great desire to enter it and see with his own eyesif the wonderful tales that were told of it all over the country weretrue. The licentiate said he would get him a cousin of his own, a famousscholar, and one very much given to reading books of chivalry, who wouldhave great pleasure in conducting him to the mouth of the very cave, andwould show him the lakes of Ruidera, which were likewise famous all overLa Mancha, and even all over Spain; and he assured him he would find himentertaining, for he was a youth who could write books good enough to beprinted and dedicated to princes. The cousin arrived at last, leading anass in foal, with a pack-saddle covered with a parti-coloured carpet orsackcloth; Sancho saddled Rocinante, got Dapple ready, and stocked hisalforjas, along with which went those of the cousin, likewise well filled;and so, commending themselves to God and bidding farewell to all, they setout, taking the road for the famous cave of Montesinos.</p><p>On the way Don Quixote asked the cousin of what sort and character hispursuits, avocations, and studies were, to which he replied that he was byprofession a humanist, and that his pursuits and studies were making booksfor the press, all of great utility and no less entertainment to thenation. One was called &ldquo;The Book of Liveries,&rdquo; in which hedescribed seven hundred and three liveries, with their colours, mottoes,and ciphers, from which gentlemen of the court might pick and choose anythey fancied for festivals and revels, without having to go a-begging forthem from anyone, or puzzling their brains, as the saying is, to have themappropriate to their objects and purposes; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said he,&ldquo;I give the jealous, the rejected, the forgotten, the absent, whatwill suit them, and fit them without fail. I have another book, too, whichI shall call &lsquo;Metamorphoses, or the Spanish Ovid,&rsquo; one of rareand original invention, for imitating Ovid in burlesque style, I show init who the Giralda of Seville and the Angel of the Magdalena were, whatthe sewer of Vecinguerra at Cordova was, what the bulls of Guisando, theSierra Morena, the Leganitos and Lavapies fountains at Madrid, notforgetting those of the Piojo, of the Cano Dorado, and of the Priora; andall with their allegories, metaphors, and changes, so that they areamusing, interesting, and instructive, all at once. Another book I havewhich I call &lsquo;The Supplement to Polydore Vergil,&rsquo; which treatsof the invention of things, and is a work of great erudition and research,for I establish and elucidate elegantly some things of great importancewhich Polydore omitted to mention. He forgot to tell us who was the firstman in the world that had a cold in his head, and who was the first to trysalivation for the French disease, but I give it accurately set forth, andquote more than five-and-twenty authors in proof of it, so you mayperceive I have laboured to good purpose and that the book will be ofservice to the whole world.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho, who had been very attentive to the cousin&rsquo;s words, said tohim, &ldquo;Tell me, señor&mdash;and God give you luck in printing yourbooks&mdash;can you tell me (for of course you know, as you knoweverything) who was the first man that scratched his head? For to mythinking it must have been our father Adam.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it must,&rdquo; replied the cousin; &ldquo;for there is no doubtbut Adam had a head and hair; and being the first man in the world hewould have scratched himself sometimes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I think,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;but now tell me, who was thefirst tumbler in the world?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really, brother,&rdquo; answered the cousin, &ldquo;I could not atthis moment say positively without having investigated it; I will look itup when I go back to where I have my books, and will satisfy you the nexttime we meet, for this will not be the last time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look here, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t giveyourself any trouble about it, for I have just this minute hit upon what Iasked you. The first tumbler in the world, you must know, was Lucifer,when they cast or pitched him out of heaven; for he came tumbling into thebottomless pit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are right, friend,&rdquo; said the cousin; and said DonQuixote, &ldquo;Sancho, that question and answer are not thine own; thouhast heard them from someone else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold your peace, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;faith, if I taketo asking questions and answering, I&rsquo;ll go on from this tillto-morrow morning. Nay! to ask foolish things and answer nonsense I needn&rsquo;tgo looking for help from my neighbours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou hast said more than thou art aware of, Sancho,&rdquo; said DonQuixote; &ldquo;for there are some who weary themselves out in learningand proving things that, after they are known and proved, are not worth afarthing to the understanding or memory.&rdquo;</p><p>In this and other pleasant conversation the day went by, and that nightthey put up at a small hamlet whence it was not more than two leagues tothe cave of Montesinos, so the cousin told Don Quixote, adding, that if hewas bent upon entering it, it would be requisite for him to providehimself with ropes, so that he might be tied and lowered into its depths.Don Quixote said that even if it reached to the bottomless pit he meant tosee where it went to; so they bought about a hundred fathoms of rope, andnext day at two in the afternoon they arrived at the cave, the mouth ofwhich is spacious and wide, but full of thorn and wild-fig bushes andbrambles and briars, so thick and matted that they completely close it upand cover it over.</p><p>On coming within sight of it the cousin, Sancho, and Don Quixotedismounted, and the first two immediately tied the latter very firmly withthe ropes, and as they were girding and swathing him Sancho said to him,&ldquo;Mind what you are about, master mine; don&rsquo;t go buryingyourself alive, or putting yourself where you&rsquo;ll be like a bottleput to cool in a well; it&rsquo;s no affair or business of your worship&rsquo;sto become the explorer of this, which must be worse than a Moorishdungeon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tie me and hold thy peace,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for anemprise like this, friend Sancho, was reserved for me;&rdquo; and said theguide, &ldquo;I beg of you, Señor Don Quixote, to observe carefully andexamine with a hundred eyes everything that is within there; perhaps theremay be some things for me to put into my book of &lsquo;Transformations.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The drum is in hands that will know how to beat it well enough,&rdquo;said Sancho Panza.</p><p>When he had said this and finished the tying (which was not over thearmour but only over the doublet) Don Quixote observed, &ldquo;It wascareless of us not to have provided ourselves with a small cattle-bell tobe tied on the rope close to me, the sound of which would show that I wasstill descending and alive; but as that is out of the question now, in God&rsquo;shand be it to guide me;&rdquo; and forthwith he fell on his knees and in alow voice offered up a prayer to heaven, imploring God to aid him andgrant him success in this to all appearance perilous and untriedadventure, and then exclaimed aloud, &ldquo;O mistress of my actions andmovements, illustrious and peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, if so be theprayers and supplications of this fortunate lover can reach thy ears, bythy incomparable beauty I entreat thee to listen to them, for they but askthee not to refuse me thy favour and protection now that I stand in suchneed of them. I am about to precipitate, to sink, to plunge myself intothe abyss that is here before me, only to let the world know that whilethou dost favour me there is no impossibility I will not attempt andaccomplish.&rdquo; With these words he approached the cavern, andperceived that it was impossible to let himself down or effect an entranceexcept by sheer force or cleaving a passage; so drawing his sword he beganto demolish and cut away the brambles at the mouth of the cave, at thenoise of which a vast multitude of crows and choughs flew out of it sothick and so fast that they knocked Don Quixote down; and if he had beenas much of a believer in augury as he was a Catholic Christian he wouldhave taken it as a bad omen and declined to bury himself in such a place.He got up, however, and as there came no more crows, or night-birds likethe bats that flew out at the same time with the crows, the cousin andSancho giving him rope, he lowered himself into the depths of the dreadcavern; and as he entered it Sancho sent his blessing after him, making athousand crosses over him and saying, &ldquo;God, and the Peña de Francia,and the Trinity of Gaeta guide thee, flower and cream of knights-errant.There thou goest, thou dare-devil of the earth, heart of steel, arm ofbrass; once more, God guide thee and send thee back safe, sound, andunhurt to the light of this world thou art leaving to bury thyself in thedarkness thou art seeking there;&rdquo; and the cousin offered up almostthe same prayers and supplications.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p22c" id="p22c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p22c.jpg (365K)" src="images/p22c.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p22c.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote kept calling to them to give him rope and more rope, and theygave it out little by little, and by the time the calls, which came out ofthe cave as out of a pipe, ceased to be heard they had let down thehundred fathoms of rope. They were inclined to pull Don Quixote up again,as they could give him no more rope; however, they waited about half anhour, at the end of which time they began to gather in the rope again withgreat ease and without feeling any weight, which made them fancy DonQuixote was remaining below; and persuaded that it was so, Sancho weptbitterly, and hauled away in great haste in order to settle the question.When, however, they had come to, as it seemed, rather more than eightyfathoms they felt a weight, at which they were greatly delighted; and atlast, at ten fathoms more, they saw Don Quixote distinctly, and Sanchocalled out to him, saying, &ldquo;Welcome back, señor, for we had begun tothink you were going to stop there to found a family.&rdquo; But DonQuixote answered not a word, and drawing him out entirely they perceivedhe had his eyes shut and every appearance of being fast asleep.</p><p>They stretched him on the ground and untied him, but still he did notawake; however, they rolled him back and forwards and shook and pulled himabout, so that after some time he came to himself, stretching himself justas if he were waking up from a deep and sound sleep, and looking about himhe said, &ldquo;God forgive you, friends; ye have taken me away from thesweetest and most delightful existence and spectacle that ever human beingenjoyed or beheld. Now indeed do I know that all the pleasures of thislife pass away like a shadow and a dream, or fade like the flower of thefield. O ill-fated Montesinos! O sore-wounded Durandarte! O unhappyBelerma!

A little light reaches itthrough some chinks or crevices, communicating with it and open to thesurface of the earth. This recess or space I perceived when I was alreadygrowing weary and disgusted at finding myself hanging suspended by therope, travelling downwards into that dark region without any certainty orknowledge of where I was going, so I resolved to enter it and rest myselffor a while. I called out, telling you not to let out more rope until Ibade you, but you cannot have heard me. I then gathered in the rope youwere sending me, and making a coil or pile of it I seated myself upon it,ruminating and considering what I was to do to lower myself to the bottom,having no one to hold me up; and as I was thus deep in thought andperplexity, suddenly and without provocation a profound sleep fell uponme, and when I least expected it, I know not how, I awoke and found myselfin the midst of the most beautiful, delightful meadow that nature couldproduce or the most lively human imagination conceive. I opened my eyes, Irubbed them, and found I was not asleep but thoroughly awake.Nevertheless, I felt my head and breast to satisfy myself whether it was Imyself who was there or some empty delusive phantom; but touch, feeling,the collected thoughts that passed through my mind, all convinced me thatI was the same then and there that I am this moment. Next there presenteditself to my sight a stately royal palace or castle, with walls thatseemed built of clear transparent crystal; and through two great doorsthat opened wide therein, I saw coming forth and advancing towards me avenerable old man, clad in a long gown of mulberry-coloured serge thattrailed upon the ground. On his shoulders and breast he had a green satincollegiate hood, and covering his head a black Milanese bonnet, and hissnow-white beard fell below his girdle. He carried no arms whatever,nothing but a rosary of beads bigger than fair-sized filberts, each tenthbead being like a moderate ostrich egg; his bearing, his gait, his dignityand imposing presence held me spellbound and wondering. He approached me,and the first thing he did was to embrace me closely, and then he said tome, &lsquo;For a long time now, O valiant knight Don Quixote of La Mancha,we who are here enchanted in these solitudes have been hoping to see thee,that thou mayest make known to the world what is shut up and concealed inthis deep cave, called the cave of Montesinos, which thou hast entered, anachievement reserved for thy invincible heart and stupendous courage aloneto attempt. Come with me, illustrious sir, and I will show thee themarvels hidden within this transparent castle, whereof I am the alcaideand perpetual warden; for I am Montesinos himself, from whom the cavetakes its name.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The instant he told me he was Montesinos, I asked him if the storythey told in the world above here was true, that he had taken out theheart of his great friend Durandarte from his breast with a little dagger,and carried it to the lady Belerma, as his friend when at the point ofdeath had commanded him. He said in reply that they spoke the truth inevery respect except as to the dagger, for it was not a dagger, norlittle, but a burnished poniard sharper than an awl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That poniard must have been made by Ramon de Hoces the Sevillian,&rdquo;said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;it could not havebeen by that poniard maker, however, because Ramon de Hoces was a man ofyesterday, and the affair of Roncesvalles, where this mishap occurred, waslong ago; but the question is of no great importance, nor does it affector make any alteration in the truth or substance of the story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the cousin; &ldquo;continue, Señor DonQuixote, for I am listening to you with the greatest pleasure in theworld.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And with no less do I tell the tale,&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;and so, to proceed&mdash;the venerable Montesinos led me into thepalace of crystal, where, in a lower chamber, strangely cool and entirelyof alabaster, was an elaborately wrought marble tomb, upon which I beheld,stretched at full length, a knight, not of bronze, or marble, or jasper,as are seen on other tombs, but of actual flesh and bone. His right hand(which seemed to me somewhat hairy and sinewy, a sign of great strength inits owner) lay on the side of his heart; but before I could put anyquestion to Montesinos, he, seeing me gazing at the tomb in amazement,said to me, &lsquo;This is my friend Durandarte, flower and mirror of thetrue lovers and valiant knights of his time. He is held enchanted here, asI myself and many others are, by that French enchanter Merlin, who, theysay, was the devil&rsquo;s son; but my belief is, not that he was thedevil&rsquo;s son, but that he knew, as the saying is, a point more thanthe devil. How or why he enchanted us, no one knows, but time will tell,and I suspect that time is not far off. What I marvel at is, that I knowit to be as sure as that it is now day, that Durandarte ended his life inmy arms, and that, after his death, I took out his heart with my ownhands; and indeed it must have weighed more than two pounds, for,according to naturalists, he who has a large heart is more largely endowedwith valour than he who has a small one. Then, as this is the case, and asthe knight did really die, how comes it that he now moans and sighs fromtime to time, as if he were still alive?&rsquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p23b" id="p23b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p23b.jpg (243K)" src="images/p23b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p23b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;As he said this, the wretched Durandarte cried out in a loud voice:</p><p class="poem">O cousin Montesinos!<br/>&rsquo;Twas my last request of thee,<br/>When my soul hath left the body,<br/>And that lying dead I be,<br/>With thy poniard or thy dagger<br/>Cut the heart from out my breast,<br/>And bear it to Belerma.<br/>This was my last request.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>&ldquo;On hearing which, the venerable Montesinos fell on his knees beforethe unhappy knight, and with tearful eyes exclaimed, &lsquo;Long since,Señor Durandarte, my beloved cousin, long since have I done what you bademe on that sad day when I lost you; I took out your heart as well as Icould, not leaving an atom of it in your breast, I wiped it with a lacehandkerchief, and I took the road to France with it, having first laid youin the bosom of the earth with tears enough to wash and cleanse my handsof the blood that covered them after wandering among your bowels; and moreby token, O cousin of my soul, at the first village I came to afterleaving Roncesvalles, I sprinkled a little salt upon your heart to keep itsweet, and bring it, if not fresh, at least pickled, into the presence ofthe lady Belerma, whom, together with you, myself, Guadiana your squire,the duenna Ruidera and her seven daughters and two nieces, and many moreof your friends and acquaintances, the sage Merlin has been keepingenchanted here these many years; and although more than five hundred havegone by, not one of us has died; Ruidera and her daughters and niecesalone are missing, and these, because of the tears they shed, Merlin, outof the compassion he seems to have felt for them, changed into so manylakes, which to this day in the world of the living, and in the provinceof La Mancha, are called the Lakes of Ruidera. The seven daughters belongto the kings of Spain and the two nieces to the knights of a very holyorder called the Order of St. John. Guadiana your squire, likewisebewailing your fate, was changed into a river of his own name, but when hecame to the surface and beheld the sun of another heaven, so great was hisgrief at finding he was leaving you, that he plunged into the bowels ofthe earth; however, as he cannot help following his natural course, hefrom time to time comes forth and shows himself to the sun and the world.The lakes aforesaid send him their waters, and with these, and others thatcome to him, he makes a grand and imposing entrance into Portugal; but forall that, go where he may, he shows his melancholy and sadness, and takesno pride in breeding dainty choice fish, only coarse and tasteless sorts,very different from those of the golden Tagus. All this that I tell younow, O cousin mine, I have told you many times before, and as you make noanswer, I fear that either you believe me not, or do not hear me, whereatI feel God knows what grief. I have now news to give you, which, if itserves not to alleviate your sufferings, will not in any wise increasethem. Know that you have here before you (open your eyes and you will see)that great knight of whom the sage Merlin has prophesied such greatthings; that Don Quixote of La Mancha I mean, who has again, and to betterpurpose than in past times, revived in these days knight-errantry, longsince forgotten, and by whose intervention and aid it may be we shall bedisenchanted; for great deeds are reserved for great men.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And if that may not be,&rsquo; said the wretched Durandartein a low and feeble voice, &lsquo;if that may not be, then, my cousin, Isay &ldquo;patience and shuffle;&rdquo;&rsquo; and turning over on hisside, he relapsed into his former silence without uttering another word.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p23c" id="p23c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p23c.jpg (331K)" src="images/p23c.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p23c.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;And now there was heard a great outcry and lamentation, accompaniedby deep sighs and bitter sobs. I looked round, and through the crystalwall I saw passing through another chamber a procession of two lines offair damsels all clad in mourning, and with white turbans of Turkishfashion on their heads. Behind, in the rear of these, there came a lady,for so from her dignity she seemed to be, also clad in black, with a whiteveil so long and ample that it swept the ground. Her turban was twice aslarge as the largest of any of the others; her eyebrows met, her nose wasrather flat, her mouth was large but with ruddy lips, and her teeth, ofwhich at times she allowed a glimpse, were seen to be sparse and ill-set,though as white as peeled almonds. She carried in her hands a fine cloth,and in it, as well as I could make out, a heart that had been mummied, soparched and dried was it. Montesinos told me that all those forming theprocession were the attendants of Durandarte and Belerma, who wereenchanted there with their master and mistress, and that the last, she whocarried the heart in the cloth, was the lady Belerma, who, with herdamsels, four days in the week went in procession singing, or ratherweeping, dirges over the body and miserable heart of his cousin; and thatif she appeared to me somewhat ill-favoured or not so beautiful as famereported her, it was because of the bad nights and worse days that shepassed in that enchantment, as I could see by the great dark circles roundher eyes, and her sickly complexion; &lsquo;her sallowness, and the ringsround her eyes,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;are not caused by the periodicalailment usual with women, for it is many months and even years since shehas had any, but by the grief her own heart suffers because of that whichshe holds in her hand perpetually, and which recalls and brings back toher memory the sad fate of her lost lover; were it not for this, hardlywould the great Dulcinea del Toboso, so celebrated in all these parts, andeven in the world, come up to her for beauty, grace, and gaiety.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hold hard!&rsquo; said I at this, &lsquo;tell your story as youought, Señor Don Montesinos, for you know very well that all comparisons areodious, and there is no occasion to compare one person with another; thepeerless Dulcinea del Toboso is what she is, and the lady Doña Belerma is what<i>she</i> is and has been, and that&rsquo;s enough.&rsquo; To which he madeanswer, &lsquo;Forgive me, Señor Don Quixote; I own I was wrong and spokeunadvisedly in saying that the lady Dulcinea could scarcely come up to the ladyBelerma; for it were enough for me to have learned, by what means I know not,that you are her knight, to make me bite my tongue out before I compared her toanything save heaven itself.&rsquo; After this apology which the greatMontesinos made me, my heart recovered itself from the shock I had received inhearing my lady compared with Belerma.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still I wonder,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that your worship didnot get upon the old fellow and bruise every bone of him with kicks, andpluck his beard until you didn&rsquo;t leave a hair in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nay, Sancho, my friend,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;it wouldnot have been right in me to do that, for we are all bound to pay respectto the aged, even though they be not knights, but especially to those whoare, and who are enchanted; I only know I gave him as good as he broughtin the many other questions and answers we exchanged.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot understand, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; remarked the cousinhere, &ldquo;how it is that your worship, in such a short space of time asyou have been below there, could have seen so many things, and said andanswered so much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How long is it since I went down?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Little better than an hour,&rdquo; replied Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;That cannot be,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;because nightovertook me while I was there, and day came, and it was night again andday again three times; so that, by my reckoning, I have been three days inthose remote regions beyond our ken.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My master must be right,&rdquo; replied Sancho; &ldquo;for aseverything that has happened to him is by enchantment, maybe what seems tous an hour would seem three days and nights there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;And did your worship eat anything all that time, señor?&rdquo;asked the cousin.</p><p>&ldquo;I never touched a morsel,&rdquo; answered Don Quixote, &ldquo;nordid I feel hunger, or think of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And do the enchanted eat?&rdquo; said the cousin.</p><p>&ldquo;They neither eat,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;nor are theysubject to the greater excrements, though it is thought that their nails,beards, and hair grow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And do the enchanted sleep, now, señor?&rdquo; asked Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;at least, duringthose three days I was with them not one of them closed an eye, nor did Ieither.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The proverb, &lsquo;Tell me what company thou keepest and I&rsquo;lltell thee what thou art,&rsquo; is to the point here,&rdquo; said Sancho;&ldquo;your worship keeps company with enchanted people that are alwaysfasting and watching; what wonder is it, then, that you neither eat norsleep while you are with them? But forgive me, señor, if I say that of allthis you have told us now, may God take me&mdash;I was just going to saythe devil&mdash;if I believe a single particle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the cousin, &ldquo;has Señor Don Quixote, then,been lying? Why, even if he wished it he has not had time to imagine andput together such a host of lies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe my master lies,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;If not, what dost thou believe?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;that this Merlin, or thoseenchanters who enchanted the whole crew your worship says you saw anddiscoursed with down there, stuffed your imagination or your mind with allthis rigmarole you have been treating us to, and all that is still tocome.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that might be, Sancho,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;butit is not so, for everything that I have told you I saw with my own eyes,and touched with my own hands. But what will you say when I tell you nowhow, among the countless other marvellous things Montesinos showed me (ofwhich at leisure and at the proper time I will give thee an account in thecourse of our journey, for they would not be all in place here), he showedme three country girls who went skipping and capering like goats over thepleasant fields there, and the instant I beheld them I knew one to be thepeerless Dulcinea del Toboso, and the other two those same country girlsthat were with her and that we spoke to on the road from El Toboso! Iasked Montesinos if he knew them, and he told me he did not, but hethought they must be some enchanted ladies of distinction, for it was onlya few days before that they had made their appearance in those meadows;but I was not to be surprised at that, because there were a great manyother ladies there of times past and present, enchanted in various strangeshapes, and among them he had recognised Queen Guinevere and her dameQuintañona, she who poured out the wine for Lancelot when he came fromBritain.&rdquo;</p><p>When Sancho Panza heard his master say this he was ready to take leave ofhis senses, or die with laughter; for, as he knew the real truth about thepretended enchantment of Dulcinea, in which he himself had been theenchanter and concocter of all the evidence, he made up his mind at lastthat, beyond all doubt, his master was out of his wits and stark mad, sohe said to him, &ldquo;It was an evil hour, a worse season, and asorrowful day, when your worship, dear master mine, went down to the otherworld, and an unlucky moment when you met with Señor Montesinos, who hassent you back to us like this. You were well enough here above in yourfull senses, such as God had given you, delivering maxims and givingadvice at every turn, and not as you are now, talking the greatestnonsense that can be imagined.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As I know thee, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;I heed notthy words.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nor I your worship&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;whether youbeat me or kill me for those I have spoken, and will speak if you don&rsquo;tcorrect and mend your own. But tell me, while we are still at peace, howor by what did you recognise the lady our mistress; and if you spoke toher, what did you say, and what did she answer?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I recognised her,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;by her wearingthe same garments she wore when thou didst point her out to me. I spoke toher, but she did not utter a word in reply; on the contrary, she turnedher back on me and took to flight, at such a pace that crossbow bolt couldnot have overtaken her. I wished to follow her, and would have done so hadnot Montesinos recommended me not to take the trouble as it would beuseless, particularly as the time was drawing near when it would benecessary for me to quit the cavern. He told me, moreover, that in courseof time he would let me know how he and Belerma, and Durandarte, and allwho were there, were to be disenchanted. But of all I saw and observeddown there, what gave me most pain was, that while Montesinos was speakingto me, one of the two companions of the hapless Dulcinea approached me onone without my having seen her coming, and with tears in her eyes said tome, in a low, agitated voice, &lsquo;My lady Dulcinea del Toboso kissesyour worship&rsquo;s hands, and entreats you to do her the favour ofletting her know how you are; and, being in great need, she also entreatsyour worship as earnestly as she can to be so good as to lend her half adozen reals, or as much as you may have about you, on this new dimitypetticoat that I have here; and she promises to repay them very speedily.&rsquo;I was amazed and taken aback by such a message, and turning to SeñorMontesinos I asked him, &lsquo;Is it possible, Señor Montesinos, thatpersons of distinction under enchantment can be in need?&rsquo; To whichhe replied, &lsquo;Believe me, Señor Don Quixote, that which is calledneed is to be met with everywhere, and penetrates all quarters and reacheseveryone, and does not spare even the enchanted; and as the lady Dulcineadel Toboso sends to beg those six reals, and the pledge is to allappearance a good one, there is nothing for it but to give them to her,for no doubt she must be in some great strait.&rsquo; &lsquo;I will takeno pledge of her,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;nor yet can I give her what sheasks, for all I have is four reals; which I gave (they were those whichthou, Sancho, gavest me the other day to bestow in alms upon the poor Imet along the road), and I said, &lsquo;Tell your mistress, my dear, thatI am grieved to the heart because of her distresses, and wish I was aFucar to remedy them, and that I would have her know that I cannot be, andought not be, in health while deprived of the happiness of seeing her andenjoying her discreet conversation, and that I implore her as earnestly asI can, to allow herself to be seen and addressed by this her captiveservant and forlorn knight. Tell her, too, that when she least expects itshe will hear it announced that I have made an oath and vow after thefashion of that which the Marquis of Mantua made to avenge his nephewBaldwin, when he found him at the point of death in the heart of themountains, which was, not to eat bread off a tablecloth, and othertrifling matters which he added, until he had avenged him; and I will makethe same to take no rest, and to roam the seven regions of the earth morethoroughly than the Infante Don Pedro of Portugal ever roamed them, untilI have disenchanted her.&rsquo; &lsquo;All that and more, you owe my lady,&rsquo;the damsel&rsquo;s answer to me, and taking the four reals, instead ofmaking me a curtsey she cut a caper, springing two full yards into theair.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O blessed God!&rdquo; exclaimed Sancho aloud at this, &ldquo;is itpossible that such things can be in the world, and that enchanters andenchantments can have such power in it as to have changed my master&rsquo;sright senses into a craze so full of absurdity! O señor, señor, for God&rsquo;ssake, consider yourself, have a care for your honour, and give no creditto this silly stuff that has left you scant and short of wits.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou talkest in this way because thou lovest me, Sancho,&rdquo;said Don Quixote; &ldquo;and not being experienced in the things of theworld, everything that has some difficulty about it seems to theeimpossible; but time will pass, as I said before, and I will tell theesome of the things I saw down there which will make thee believe what Ihave related now, the truth of which admits of neither reply nor question.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p23e" id="p23e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p23e.jpg (54K)" src="images/p23e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch24b" id="ch24b"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br/>WHEREIN ARE RELATED A THOUSAND TRIFLING MATTERS, AS TRIVIAL AS THEY ARENECESSARY TO THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF THIS GREAT HISTORY</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p24a" id="p24a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p24a.jpg (137K)" src="images/p24a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p24a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>He who translated this great history from the original written by itsfirst author, Cide Hamete Benengeli, says that on coming to the chaptergiving the adventures of the cave of Montesinos he found written on themargin of it, in Hamete&rsquo;s own hand, these exact words:</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot convince or persuade myself that everything that iswritten in the preceding chapter could have precisely happened to thevaliant Don Quixote; and for this reason, that all the adventures thathave occurred up to the present have been possible and probable; but asfor this one of the cave, I see no way of accepting it as true, as itpasses all reasonable bounds. For me to believe that Don Quixote couldlie, he being the most truthful gentleman and the noblest knight of histime, is impossible; he would not have told a lie though he were shot todeath with arrows. On the other hand, I reflect that he related and toldthe story with all the circumstances detailed, and that he could not in soshort a space have fabricated such a vast complication of absurdities; if,then, this adventure seems apocryphal, it is no fault of mine; and so,without affirming its falsehood or its truth, I write it down. Decide forthyself in thy wisdom, reader; for I am not bound, nor is it in my power,to do more; though certain it is they say that at the time of his death heretracted, and said he had invented it, thinking it matched and talliedwith the adventures he had read of in his histories.&rdquo; And then hegoes on to say:</p><p>The cousin was amazed as well at Sancho&rsquo;s boldness as at thepatience of his master, and concluded that the good temper the latterdisplayed arose from the happiness he felt at having seen his ladyDulcinea, even enchanted as she was; because otherwise the words andlanguage Sancho had addressed to him deserved a thrashing; for indeed heseemed to him to have been rather impudent to his master, to whom he nowobserved, &ldquo;I, Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, look upon the time Ihave spent in travelling with your worship as very well employed, for Ihave gained four things in the course of it; the first is that I have madeyour acquaintance, which I consider great good fortune; the second, that Ihave learned what the cave of Montesinos contains, together with thetransformations of Guadiana and of the lakes of Ruidera; which will be ofuse to me for the Spanish Ovid that I have in hand; the third, to havediscovered the antiquity of cards, that they were in use at least in thetime of Charlemagne, as may be inferred from the words you say Durandarteuttered when, at the end of that long spell while Montesinos was talkingto him, he woke up and said, &lsquo;Patience and shuffle.&rsquo; Thisphrase and expression he could not have learned while he was enchanted,but only before he had become so, in France, and in the time of theaforesaid emperor Charlemagne. And this demonstration is just the thingfor me for that other book I am writing, the &lsquo;Supplement to PolydoreVergil on the Invention of Antiquities;&rsquo; for I believe he neverthought of inserting that of cards in his book, as I mean to do in mine,and it will be a matter of great importance, particularly when I can citeso grave and veracious an authority as Señor Durandarte. And the fourththing is, that I have ascertained the source of the river Guadiana,heretofore unknown to mankind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but I should like toknow, if by God&rsquo;s favour they grant you a licence to print thosebooks of yours&mdash;which I doubt&mdash;to whom do you mean to dedicatethem?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are lords and grandees in Spain to whom they can bededicated,&rdquo; said the cousin.</p><p>&ldquo;Not many,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;not that they areunworthy of it, but because they do not care to accept books and incur theobligation of making the return that seems due to the author&rsquo;slabour and courtesy. One prince I know who makes up for all the rest, andmore&mdash;how much more, if I ventured to say, perhaps I should stir upenvy in many a noble breast; but let this stand over for some moreconvenient time, and let us go and look for some place to shelterourselves in to-night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not far from this,&rdquo; said the cousin, &ldquo;there is ahermitage, where there lives a hermit, who they say was a soldier, and whohas the reputation of being a good Christian and a very intelligent andcharitable man. Close to the hermitage he has a small house which he builtat his own cost, but though small it is large enough for the reception ofguests.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Has this hermit any hens, do you think?&rdquo; asked Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Few hermits are without them,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;forthose we see now-a-days are not like the hermits of the Egyptian desertswho were clad in palm-leaves, and lived on the roots of the earth. But donot think that by praising these I am disparaging the others; all I meanto say is that the penances of those of the present day do not come up tothe asceticism and austerity of former times; but it does not follow fromthis that they are not all worthy; at least I think them so; and at theworst the hypocrite who pretends to be good does less harm than the opensinner.&rdquo;</p><p>At this point they saw approaching the spot where they stood a man onfoot, proceeding at a rapid pace, and beating a mule loaded with lancesand halberds. When he came up to them, he saluted them and passed onwithout stopping. Don Quixote called to him, &ldquo;Stay, good fellow; youseem to be making more haste than suits that mule.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot stop, señor,&rdquo; answered the man; &ldquo;for the armsyou see I carry here are to be used to-morrow, so I must not delay; God bewith you. But if you want to know what I am carrying them for, I mean tolodge to-night at the inn that is beyond the hermitage, and if you begoing the same road you will find me there, and I will tell you somecurious things; once more God be with you;&rdquo; and he urged on his muleat such a pace that Don Quixote had no time to ask him what these curiousthings were that he meant to tell them; and as he was somewhatinquisitive, and always tortured by his anxiety to learn something new, hedecided to set out at once, and go and pass the night at the inn insteadof stopping at the hermitage, where the cousin would have had them halt.Accordingly they mounted and all three took the direct road for the inn,which they reached a little before nightfall. On the road the cousinproposed they should go up to the hermitage to drink a sup. The instantSancho heard this he steered his Dapple towards it, and Don Quixote andthe cousin did the same; but it seems Sancho&rsquo;s bad luck so orderedit that the hermit was not at home, for so a sub-hermit they found in thehermitage told them. They called for some of the best. She replied thather master had none, but that if they liked cheap water she would give itwith great pleasure.</p><p>&ldquo;If I found any in water,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;there are wellsalong the road where I could have had enough of it. Ah, Camacho&rsquo;swedding, and plentiful house of Don Diego, how often do I miss you!&rdquo;</p><p>Leaving the hermitage, they pushed on towards the inn, and a littlefarther they came upon a youth who was pacing along in front of them at nogreat speed, so that they overtook him. He carried a sword over hisshoulder, and slung on it a budget or bundle of his clothes apparently,probably his breeches or pantaloons, and his cloak and a shirt or two; forhe had on a short jacket of velvet with a gloss like satin on it inplaces, and had his shirt out; his stockings were of silk, and his shoessquare-toed as they wear them at court. His age might have been eighteenor nineteen; he was of a merry countenance, and to all appearance of anactive habit, and he went along singing seguidillas to beguile thewearisomeness of the road. As they came up with him he was just finishingone, which the cousin got by heart and they say ran thus&mdash;</p><p class="poem">I&rsquo;m off to the wars<br/>For the want of pence,<br/>Oh, had I but money<br/>I&rsquo;d show more sense.</p><p>The first to address him was Don Quixote, who said, &ldquo;You travel veryairily, sir gallant; whither bound, may we ask, if it is your pleasure totell us?&rdquo;</p><p>To which the youth replied, &ldquo;The heat and my poverty are the reasonof my travelling so airily, and it is to the wars that I am bound.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How poverty?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote; &ldquo;the heat one canunderstand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; replied the youth, &ldquo;in this bundle I carryvelvet pantaloons to match this jacket; if I wear them out on the road, Ishall not be able to make a decent appearance in them in the city, and Ihave not the wherewithal to buy others; and so for this reason, as well asto keep myself cool, I am making my way in this fashion to overtake somecompanies of infantry that are not twelve leagues off, in which I shallenlist, and there will be no want of baggage trains to travel with afterthat to the place of embarkation, which they say will be Carthagena; Iwould rather have the King for a master, and serve him in the wars, thanserve a court pauper.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And did you get any bounty, now?&rdquo; asked the cousin.</p><p>&ldquo;If I had been in the service of some grandee of Spain or personageof distinction,&rdquo; replied the youth, &ldquo;I should have been safeto get it; for that is the advantage of serving good masters, that out ofthe servants&rsquo; hall men come to be ancients or captains, or get agood pension. But I, to my misfortune, always served place-hunters andadventurers, whose keep and wages were so miserable and scanty that halfwent in paying for the starching of one&rsquo;s collars; it would be amiracle indeed if a page volunteer ever got anything like a reasonablebounty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And tell me, for heaven&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; asked Don Quixote,&ldquo;is it possible, my friend, that all the time you served you nevergot any livery?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They gave me two,&rdquo; replied the page; &ldquo;but just as whenone quits a religious community before making profession, they strip himof the dress of the order and give him back his own clothes, so did mymasters return me mine; for as soon as the business on which they came tocourt was finished, they went home and took back the liveries they hadgiven merely for show.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What spilorceria!&mdash;as an Italian would say,&rdquo; said DonQuixote; &ldquo;but for all that, consider yourself happy in having leftcourt with as worthy an object as you have, for there is nothing on earthmore honourable or profitable than serving, first of all God, and then one&rsquo;sking and natural lord, particularly in the profession of arms, by which,if not more wealth, at least more honour is to be won than by letters, asI have said many a time; for though letters may have founded more greathouses than arms, still those founded by arms have I know not whatsuperiority over those founded by letters, and a certain splendourbelonging to them that distinguishes them above all. And bear in mind whatI am now about to say to you, for it will be of great use and comfort toyou in time of trouble; it is, not to let your mind dwell on the adversechances that may befall you; for the worst of all is death, and if it be agood death, the best of all is to die. They asked Julius Cæsar, thevaliant Roman emperor, what was the best death. He answered, that which isunexpected, which comes suddenly and unforeseen; and though he answeredlike a pagan, and one without the knowledge of the true God, yet, as faras sparing our feelings is concerned, he was right; for suppose you arekilled in the first engagement or skirmish, whether by a cannon ball orblown up by mine, what matters it? It is only dying, and all is over; andaccording to Terence, a soldier shows better dead in battle, than aliveand safe in flight; and the good soldier wins fame in proportion as he isobedient to his captains and those in command over him. And remember, myson, that it is better for the soldier to smell of gunpowder than ofcivet, and that if old age should come upon you in this honourablecalling, though you may be covered with wounds and crippled and lame, itwill not come upon you without honour, and that such as poverty cannotlessen; especially now that provisions are being made for supporting andrelieving old and disabled soldiers; for it is not right to deal with themafter the fashion of those who set free and get rid of their black slaveswhen they are old and useless, and, turning them out of their houses underthe pretence of making them free, make them slaves to hunger, from whichthey cannot expect to be released except by death. But for the present Iwon&rsquo;t say more than get ye up behind me on my horse as far as theinn, and sup with me there, and to-morrow you shall pursue your journey,and God give you as good speed as your intentions deserve.&rdquo;</p><p>The page did not accept the invitation to mount, though he did that tosupper at the inn; and here they say Sancho said to himself, &ldquo;God bewith you for a master; is it possible that a man who can say things somany and so good as he has said just now, can say that he saw theimpossible absurdities he reports about the cave of Montesinos? Well,well, we shall see.&rdquo;</p><p>And now, just as night was falling, they reached the inn, and it was notwithout satisfaction that Sancho perceived his master took it for a realinn, and not for a castle as usual. The instant they entered Don Quixoteasked the landlord after the man with the lances and halberds, and wastold that he was in the stable seeing to his mule; which was what Sanchoand the cousin proceeded to do for their beasts, giving the best mangerand the best place in the stable to Rocinante.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p24e" id="p24e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p24e.jpg (61K)" src="images/p24e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch25b" id="ch25b"></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br/>WHEREIN IS SET DOWN THE BRAYING ADVENTURE, AND THE DROLL ONE OF THEPUPPET-SHOWMAN, TOGETHER WITH THE MEMORABLE DIVINATIONS OF THE DIVININGAPE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p25a" id="p25a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p25a.jpg (154K)" src="images/p25a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p25a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote&rsquo;s bread would not bake, as the common saying is, untilhe had heard and learned the curious things promised by the man whocarried the arms. He went to seek him where the innkeeper said he was andhaving found him, bade him say now at any rate what he had to say inanswer to the question he had asked him on the road. &ldquo;The tale of mywonders must be taken more leisurely and not standing,&rdquo; said theman; &ldquo;let me finish foddering my beast, good sir; and then I&rsquo;lltell you things that will astonish you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait for that,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;I&rsquo;llhelp you in everything,&rdquo; and so he did, sifting the barley for himand cleaning out the manger; a degree of humility which made the otherfeel bound to tell him with a good grace what he had asked; so seatinghimself on a bench, with Don Quixote beside him, and the cousin, the page,Sancho Panza, and the landlord, for a senate and an audience, he began hisstory in this way:</p><p>&ldquo;You must know that in a village four leagues and a half from thisinn, it so happened that one of the regidors, by the tricks and roguery ofa servant girl of his (it&rsquo;s too long a tale to tell), lost an ass;and though he did all he possibly could to find it, it was all to nopurpose. A fortnight might have gone by, so the story goes, since the asshad been missing, when, as the regidor who had lost it was standing in theplaza, another regidor of the same town said to him, &lsquo;Pay me forgood news, gossip; your ass has turned up.&rsquo; &lsquo;That I will, andwell, gossip,&rsquo; said the other; &lsquo;but tell us, where has heturned up?&rsquo; &lsquo;In the forest,&rsquo; said the finder; &lsquo;Isaw him this morning without pack-saddle or harness of any sort, and solean that it went to one&rsquo;s heart to see him. I tried to drive himbefore me and bring him to you, but he is already so wild and shy thatwhen I went near him he made off into the thickest part of the forest. Ifyou have a mind that we two should go back and look for him, let me put upthis she-ass at my house and I&rsquo;ll be back at once.&rsquo; &lsquo;Youwill be doing me a great kindness,&rsquo; said the owner of the ass,&lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll try to pay it back in the same coin.&rsquo; It iswith all these circumstances, and in the very same way I am telling itnow, that those who know all about the matter tell the story. Well then,the two regidors set off on foot, arm in arm, for the forest, and comingto the place where they hoped to find the ass they could not find him, norwas he to be seen anywhere about, search as they might. Seeing, then, thatthere was no sign of him, the regidor who had seen him said to the other,&lsquo;Look here, gossip; a plan has occurred to me, by which, beyond adoubt, we shall manage to discover the animal, even if he is stowed awayin the bowels of the earth, not to say the forest. Here it is. I can brayto perfection, and if you can ever so little, the thing&rsquo;s as good asdone.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ever so little did you say, gossip?&rsquo; said theother; &lsquo;by God, I&rsquo;ll not give in to anybody, not even to theasses themselves.&rsquo; &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll soon see,&rsquo; said thesecond regidor, &lsquo;for my plan is that you should go one side of theforest, and I the other, so as to go all round about it; and every now andthen you will bray and I will bray; and it cannot be but that the ass willhear us, and answer us if he is in the forest.&rsquo; To which the ownerof the ass replied, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s an excellent plan, I declare,gossip, and worthy of your great genius;&rsquo; and the two separating asagreed, it so fell out that they brayed almost at the same moment, andeach, deceived by the braying of the other, ran to look, fancying the asshad turned up at last. When they came in sight of one another, said theloser, &lsquo;Is it possible, gossip, that it was not my ass that brayed?&rsquo;&lsquo;No, it was I,&rsquo; said the other. &lsquo;Well then, I can tellyou, gossip,&rsquo; said the ass&rsquo;s owner, &lsquo;that between youand an ass there is not an atom of difference as far as braying goes, forI never in all my life saw or heard anything more natural.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thosepraises and compliments belong to you more justly than to me, gossip,&rsquo;said the inventor of the plan; &lsquo;for, by the God that made me, youmight give a couple of brays odds to the best and most finished brayer inthe world; the tone you have got is deep, your voice is well kept up as totime and pitch, and your finishing notes come thick and fast; in fact, Iown myself beaten, and yield the palm to you, and give in to you in thisrare accomplishment.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well then,&rsquo; said the owner,&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll set a higher value on myself for the future, andconsider that I know something, as I have an excellence of some sort; forthough I always thought I brayed well, I never supposed I came up to thepitch of perfection you say.&rsquo; &lsquo;And I say too,&rsquo; said thesecond, &lsquo;that there are rare gifts going to loss in the world, andthat they are ill bestowed upon those who don&rsquo;t know how to make useof them.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ours,&rsquo; said the owner of the ass, &lsquo;unlessit is in cases like this we have now in hand, cannot be of any service tous, and even in this God grant they may be of some use.&rsquo; So sayingthey separated, and took to their braying once more, but every instantthey were deceiving one another, and coming to meet one another again,until they arranged by way of countersign, so as to know that it was theyand not the ass, to give two brays, one after the other. In this way,doubling the brays at every step, they made the complete circuit of theforest, but the lost ass never gave them an answer or even the sign ofone. How could the poor ill-starred brute have answered, when, in thethickest part of the forest, they found him devoured by wolves? As soon ashe saw him his owner said, &lsquo;I was wondering he did not answer, forif he wasn&rsquo;t dead he&rsquo;d have brayed when he heard us, or he&rsquo;dhave been no ass; but for the sake of having heard you bray to suchperfection, gossip, I count the trouble I have taken to look for him wellbestowed, even though I have found him dead.&rsquo; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s in agood hand, gossip,&rsquo; said the other; &lsquo;if the abbot sings well,the acolyte is not much behind him.&rsquo; So they returned disconsolateand hoarse to their village, where they told their friends, neighbours,and acquaintances what had befallen them in their search for the ass, eachcrying up the other&rsquo;s perfection in braying. The whole story came tobe known and spread abroad through the villages of the neighbourhood; andthe devil, who never sleeps, with his love for sowing dissensions andscattering discord everywhere, blowing mischief about and making quarrelsout of nothing, contrived to make the people of the other towns fall tobraying whenever they saw anyone from our village, as if to throw thebraying of our regidors in our teeth. Then the boys took to it, which wasthe same thing for it as getting into the hands and mouths of all thedevils of hell; and braying spread from one town to another in such a waythat the men of the braying town are as easy to be known as blacks are tobe known from whites, and the unlucky joke has gone so far that severaltimes the scoffed have come out in arms and in a body to do battle withthe scoffers, and neither king nor rook, fear nor shame, can mend matters.To-morrow or the day after, I believe, the men of my town, that is, of thebraying town, are going to take the field against another village twoleagues away from ours, one of those that persecute us most; and that wemay turn out well prepared I have bought these lances and halberds youhave seen. These are the curious things I told you I had to tell, and ifyou don&rsquo;t think them so, I have got no others;&rdquo; and with thisthe worthy fellow brought his story to a close.</p><p>Just at this moment there came in at the gate of the inn a man entirelyclad in chamois leather, hose, breeches, and doublet, who said in a loudvoice, &ldquo;Señor host, have you room? Here&rsquo;s the divining ape andthe show of the Release of Melisendra just coming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ods body!&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;why, it&rsquo;s MasterPedro! We&rsquo;re in for a grand night!&rdquo; I forgot to mention thatthe said Master Pedro had his left eye and nearly half his cheek coveredwith a patch of green taffety, showing that something ailed all that side.&ldquo;Your worship is welcome, Master Pedro,&rdquo; continued thelandlord; &ldquo;but where are the ape and the show, for I don&rsquo;t seethem?&rdquo; &ldquo;They are close at hand,&rdquo; said he in the chamoisleather, &ldquo;but I came on first to know if there was any room.&rdquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d make the Duke of Alva himself clear out to make room forMaster Pedro,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;bring in the ape and theshow; there&rsquo;s company in the inn to-night that will pay to see thatand the cleverness of the ape.&rdquo; &ldquo;So be it by all means,&rdquo;said the man with the patch; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lower the price, and bewell satisfied if I only pay my expenses; and now I&rsquo;ll go back andhurry on the cart with the ape and the show;&rdquo; and with this he wentout of the inn.</p><p>Don Quixote at once asked the landlord what this Master Pedro was, andwhat was the show and what was the ape he had with him; which the landlordreplied, &ldquo;This is a famous puppet-showman, who for some time pasthas been going about this Mancha de Aragon, exhibiting a show of therelease of Melisendra by the famous Don Gaiferos, one of the best andbest-represented stories that have been seen in this part of the kingdomfor many a year; he has also with him an ape with the most extraordinarygift ever seen in an ape or imagined in a human being; for if you ask himanything, he listens attentively to the question, and then jumps on hismaster&rsquo;s shoulder, and pressing close to his ear tells him theanswer which Master Pedro then delivers. He says a great deal more aboutthings past than about things to come; and though he does not always hitthe truth in every case, most times he is not far wrong, so that he makesus fancy he has got the devil in him. He gets two reals for every questionif the ape answers; I mean if his master answers for him after he haswhispered into his ear; and so it is believed that this same Master Pedrois very rich. He is a &lsquo;gallant man&rsquo; as they say in Italy, andgood company, and leads the finest life in the world; talks more than six,drinks more than a dozen, and all by his tongue, and his ape, and hisshow.&rdquo;</p><p>Master Pedro now came back, and in a cart followed the show and the ape&mdash;abig one, without a tail and with buttocks as bare as felt, but notvicious-looking. As soon as Don Quixote saw him, he asked him, &ldquo;Canyou tell me, sir fortune-teller, what fish do we catch, and how will it bewith us? See, here are my two reals,&rdquo; and he bade Sancho give themto Master Pedro; but he answered for the ape and said, &ldquo;Señor, thisanimal does not give any answer or information touching things that are tocome; of things past he knows something, and more or less of thingspresent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gad,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;I would not give a farthing to betold what&rsquo;s past with me, for who knows that better than I domyself? And to pay for being told what I know would be mighty foolish. Butas you know things present, here are my two reals, and tell me, mostexcellent sir ape, what is my wife Teresa Panza doing now, and what is shediverting herself with?&rdquo;</p><p>Master Pedro refused to take the money, saying, &ldquo;I will not receivepayment in advance or until the service has been first rendered;&rdquo;and then with his right hand he gave a couple of slaps on his leftshoulder, and with one spring the ape perched himself upon it, and puttinghis mouth to his master&rsquo;s ear began chattering his teeth rapidly;and having kept this up as long as one would be saying a credo, withanother spring he brought himself to the ground, and the same instantMaster Pedro ran in great haste and fell upon his knees before DonQuixote, and embracing his legs exclaimed, &ldquo;These legs do I embraceas I would embrace the two pillars of Hercules, O illustrious reviver ofknight-errantry, so long consigned to oblivion! O never yet duly extolledknight, Don Quixote of La Mancha, courage of the faint-hearted, prop ofthe tottering, arm of the fallen, staff and counsel of all who areunfortunate!&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p25b" id="p25b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p25b.jpg (373K)" src="images/p25b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p25b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote was thunderstruck, Sancho astounded, the cousin staggered, thepage astonished, the man from the braying town agape, the landlord inperplexity, and, in short, everyone amazed at the words of thepuppet-showman, who went on to say, &ldquo;And thou, worthy Sancho Panza,the best squire and squire to the best knight in the world! Be of goodcheer, for thy good wife Teresa is well, and she is at this momenthackling a pound of flax; and more by token she has at her left hand a jugwith a broken spout that holds a good drop of wine, with which she solacesherself at her work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I can well believe,&rdquo; said Sancho. &ldquo;She is a luckyone, and if it was not for her jealousy I would not change her for thegiantess Andandona, who by my master&rsquo;s account was a very clever andworthy woman; my Teresa is one of those that won&rsquo;t let themselveswant for anything, though their heirs may have to pay for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now I declare,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;he who reads muchand travels much sees and knows a great deal. I say so because what amountof persuasion could have persuaded me that there are apes in the worldthat can divine as I have seen now with my own eyes? For I am that veryDon Quixote of La Mancha this worthy animal refers to, though he has gonerather too far in my praise; but whatever I may be, I thank heaven that ithas endowed me with a tender and compassionate heart, always disposed todo good to all and harm to none.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I had money,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;I would ask señor apewhat will happen to me in the peregrination I am making.&rdquo;</p><p>To this Master Pedro, who had by this time risen from Don Quixote&rsquo;sfeet, replied, &ldquo;I have already said that this little beast gives noanswer as to the future; but if he did, not having money would be of noconsequence, for to oblige Señor Don Quixote, here present, I would giveup all the profits in the world. And now, because I have promised it, andto afford him pleasure, I will set up my show and offer entertainment toall who are in the inn, without any charge whatever.&rdquo; As soon as heheard this, the landlord, delighted beyond measure, pointed out a placewhere the show might be fixed, which was done at once.</p><p>Don Quixote was not very well satisfied with the divinations of the ape,as he did not think it proper that an ape should divine anything, eitherpast or future; so while Master Pedro was arranging the show, he retiredwith Sancho into a corner of the stable, where, without being overheard byanyone, he said to him, &ldquo;Look here, Sancho, I have been seriouslythinking over this ape&rsquo;s extraordinary gift, and have come to theconclusion that beyond doubt this Master Pedro, his master, has a pact,tacit or express, with the devil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If the packet is express from the devil,&rdquo; said Sancho,&ldquo;it must be a very dirty packet no doubt; but what good can it doMaster Pedro to have such packets?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou dost not understand me, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;I only mean he must have made some compact with the devil to infusethis power into the ape, that he may get his living, and after he hasgrown rich he will give him his soul, which is what the enemy of mankindwants; this I am led to believe by observing that the ape only answersabout things past or present, and the devil&rsquo;s knowledge extends nofurther; for the future he knows only by guesswork, and that not always;for it is reserved for God alone to know the times and the seasons, andfor him there is neither past nor future; all is present. This being as itis, it is clear that this ape speaks by the spirit of the devil; and I amastonished they have not denounced him to the Holy Office, and put him tothe question, and forced it out of him by whose virtue it is that hedivines; because it is certain this ape is not an astrologer; neither hismaster nor he sets up, or knows how to set up, those figures they calljudiciary, which are now so common in Spain that there is not a jade, orpage, or old cobbler, that will not undertake to set up a figure asreadily as pick up a knave of cards from the ground, bringing to noughtthe marvellous truth of the science by their lies and ignorance. I know ofa lady who asked one of these figure schemers whether her little lap-dogwould be in pup and would breed, and how many and of what colour thelittle pups would be. To which señor astrologer, after having set up hisfigure, made answer that the bitch would be in pup, and would drop threepups, one green, another bright red, and the third parti-coloured,provided she conceived between eleven and twelve either of the day ornight, and on a Monday or Saturday; but as things turned out, two daysafter this the bitch died of a surfeit, and señor planet-ruler had thecredit all over the place of being a most profound astrologer, as most ofthese planet-rulers have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;I would be glad if your worshipwould make Master Pedro ask his ape whether what happened your worship inthe cave of Montesinos is true; for, begging your worship&rsquo;s pardon,I, for my part, take it to have been all flam and lies, or at any ratesomething you dreamt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;however, I will dowhat you suggest; though I have my own scruples about it.&rdquo;</p><p>At this point Master Pedro came up in quest of Don Quixote, to tell himthe show was now ready and to come and see it, for it was worth seeing.Don Quixote explained his wish, and begged him to ask his ape at once totell him whether certain things which had happened to him in the cave ofMontesinos were dreams or realities, for to him they appeared to partakeof both. Upon this Master Pedro, without answering, went back to fetch theape, and, having placed it in front of Don Quixote and Sancho, said:&ldquo;See here, señor ape, this gentleman wishes to know whether certainthings which happened to him in the cave called the cave of Montesinoswere false or true.&rdquo; On his making the usual sign the ape mounted onhis left shoulder and seemed to whisper in his ear, and Master Pedro saidat once, &ldquo;The ape says that the things you saw or that happened toyou in that cave are, part of them false, part true; and that he onlyknows this and no more as regards this question; but if your worshipwishes to know more, on Friday next he will answer all that may be askedhim, for his virtue is at present exhausted, and will not return to himtill Friday, as he has said.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did I not say, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that I could notbring myself to believe that all your worship said about the adventures inthe cave was true, or even the half of it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The course of events will tell, Sancho,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote;&ldquo;time, that discloses all things, leaves nothing that it does notdrag into the light of day, though it be buried in the bosom of the earth.But enough of that for the present; let us go and see Master Pedro&rsquo;sshow, for I am sure there must be something novel in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something!&rdquo; said Master Pedro; &ldquo;this show of mine hassixty thousand novel things in it; let me tell you, Señor Don Quixote, itis one of the best-worth-seeing things in the world this day; but <i>operibuscredite et non verbis</i>, and now let&rsquo;s get to work, for it is growinglate, and we have a great deal to do and to say and show.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote and Sancho obeyed him and went to where the show was alreadyput up and uncovered, set all around with lighted wax tapers which made itlook splendid and bright. When they came to it Master Pedro ensconcedhimself inside it, for it was he who had to work the puppets, and a boy, aservant of his, posted himself outside to act as showman and explain themysteries of the exhibition, having a wand in his hand to point to thefigures as they came out. And so, all who were in the inn being arrangedin front of the show, some of them standing, and Don Quixote, Sancho, thepage, and cousin, accommodated with the best places, the interpreter beganto say what he will hear or see who reads or hears the next chapter.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p25e" id="p25e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p25e.jpg (28K)" src="images/p25e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch26b" id="ch26b"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br/>WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE DROLL ADVENTURE OF THE PUPPET-SHOWMAN, TOGETHERWITH OTHER THINGS IN TRUTH RIGHT GOOD</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p26a" id="p26a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p26a.jpg (157K)" src="images/p26a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p26a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>All were silent, Tyrians and Trojans; I mean all who were watching theshow were hanging on the lips of the interpreter of its wonders, whendrums and trumpets were heard to sound inside it and cannon to go off. Thenoise was soon over, and then the boy lifted up his voice and said,&ldquo;This true story which is here represented to your worships is takenword for word from the French chronicles and from the Spanish ballads thatare in everybody&rsquo;s mouth, and in the mouth of the boys about thestreets. Its subject is the release by Señor Don Gaiferos of his wifeMelisendra, when a captive in Spain at the hands of the Moors in the cityof Sansueña, for so they called then what is now called Saragossa; andthere you may see how Don Gaiferos is playing at the tables, just as theysing it&mdash;</p><p class="poem">At tables playing Don Gaiferos sits,<br/>For Melisendra is forgotten now.</p><p>And that personage who appears there with a crown on his head and asceptre in his hand is the Emperor Charlemagne, the supposed father ofMelisendra, who, angered to see his son-in-law&rsquo;s inaction andunconcern, comes in to chide him; and observe with what vehemence andenergy he chides him, so that you would fancy he was going to give himhalf a dozen raps with his sceptre; and indeed there are authors who sayhe did give them, and sound ones too; and after having said a great dealto him about imperilling his honour by not effecting the release of hiswife, he said, so the tale runs,</p><p class="poem">Enough I&rsquo;ve said, see to it now.</p><p class="noindent">Observe, too, how the emperor turns away, and leaves Don Gaiferos fuming;and you see now how in a burst of anger, he flings the table and the boardfar from him and calls in haste for his armour, and asks his cousin DonRoland for the loan of his sword, Durindana, and how Don Roland refuses tolend it, offering him his company in the difficult enterprise he isundertaking; but he, in his valour and anger, will not accept it, and saysthat he alone will suffice to rescue his wife, even though she wereimprisoned deep in the centre of the earth, and with this he retires toarm himself and set out on his journey at once. Now let your worships turnyour eyes to that tower that appears there, which is supposed to be one ofthe towers of the alcazar of Saragossa, now called the Aljaferia; thatlady who appears on that balcony dressed in Moorish fashion is thepeerless Melisendra, for many a time she used to gaze from thence upon theroad to France, and seek consolation in her captivity by thinking of Parisand her husband. Observe, too, a new incident which now occurs, such as,perhaps, never was seen. Do you not see that Moor, who silently andstealthily, with his finger on his lip, approaches Melisendra from behind?Observe now how he prints a kiss upon her lips, and what a hurry she is into spit, and wipe them with the white sleeve of her smock, and how shebewails herself, and tears her fair hair as though it were to blame forthe wrong. Observe, too, that the stately Moor who is in that corridor isKing Marsilio of Sansueña, who, having seen the Moor&rsquo;s insolence, atonce orders him (though his kinsman and a great favourite of his) to beseized and given two hundred lashes, while carried through the streets ofthe city according to custom, with criers going before him and officers ofjustice behind; and here you see them come out to execute the sentence,although the offence has been scarcely committed; for among the Moorsthere are no indictments nor remands as with us.&rdquo;</p><p>Here Don Quixote called out, &ldquo;Child, child, go straight on with yourstory, and don&rsquo;t run into curves and slants, for to establish a factclearly there is need of a great deal of proof and confirmation;&rdquo;and said Master Pedro from within, &ldquo;Boy, stick to your text and doas the gentleman bids you; it&rsquo;s the best plan; keep to your plainsong, and don&rsquo;t attempt harmonies, for they are apt to break downfrom being over fine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the boy, and he went on to say, &ldquo;Thisfigure that you see here on horseback, covered with a Gascon cloak, is DonGaiferos himself, whom his wife, now avenged of the insult of the amorousMoor, and taking her stand on the balcony of the tower with a calmer andmore tranquil countenance, has perceived without recognising him; and sheaddresses her husband, supposing him to be some traveller, and holds withhim all that conversation and colloquy in the ballad that runs&mdash;</p><p class="poem">If you, sir knight, to France are bound,<br/>Oh! for Gaiferos ask&mdash;</p><p class="noindent">which I do not repeat here because prolixity begets disgust; suffice it toobserve how Don Gaiferos discovers himself, and that by her joyfulgestures Melisendra shows us she has recognised him; and what is more, wenow see she lowers herself from the balcony to place herself on thehaunches of her good husband&rsquo;s horse. But ah! unhappy lady, the edgeof her petticoat has caught on one of the bars of the balcony and she isleft hanging in the air, unable to reach the ground. But you see howcompassionate heaven sends aid in our sorest need; Don Gaiferos advances,and without minding whether the rich petticoat is torn or not, he seizesher and by force brings her to the ground, and then with one jerk placesher on the haunches of his horse, astraddle like a man, and bids her holdon tight and clasp her arms round his neck, crossing them on his breast soas not to fall, for the lady Melisendra was not used to that style ofriding. You see, too, how the neighing of the horse shows his satisfactionwith the gallant and beautiful burden he bears in his lord and lady. Yousee how they wheel round and quit the city, and in joy and gladness takethe road to Paris. Go in peace, O peerless pair of true lovers! May youreach your longed-for fatherland in safety, and may fortune interpose noimpediment to your prosperous journey; may the eyes of your friends andkinsmen behold you enjoying in peace and tranquillity the remaining daysof your life&mdash;and that they may be as many as those of Nestor!&rdquo;</p><p>Here Master Pedro called out again and said, &ldquo;Simplicity, boy! Noneof your high flights; all affectation is bad.&rdquo;</p><p>The interpreter made no answer, but went on to say, &ldquo;There was nowant of idle eyes, that see everything, to see Melisendra come down andmount, and word was brought to King Marsilio, who at once gave orders tosound the alarm; and see what a stir there is, and how the city is drownedwith the sound of the bells pealing in the towers of all the mosques.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said Don Quixote at this; &ldquo;on that point ofthe bells Master Pedro is very inaccurate, for bells are not in use amongthe Moors; only kettledrums, and a kind of small trumpet somewhat like ourclarion; to ring bells this way in Sansueña is unquestionably a greatabsurdity.&rdquo;</p><p>On hearing this, Master Pedro stopped ringing, and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;tlook into trifles, Señor Don Quixote, or want to have things up to a pitchof perfection that is out of reach. Are there not almost every day athousand comedies represented all round us full of thousands ofinaccuracies and absurdities, and, for all that, they have a successfulrun, and are listened to not only with applause, but with admiration andall the rest of it? Go on, boy, and don&rsquo;t mind; for so long as Ifill my pouch, no matter if I show as many inaccuracies as there are motesin a sunbeam.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; and the boy went on: &ldquo;Seewhat a numerous and glittering crowd of horsemen issues from the city inpursuit of the two faithful lovers, what a blowing of trumpets there is,what sounding of horns, what beating of drums and tabors; I fear me theywill overtake them and bring them back tied to the tail of their ownhorse, which would be a dreadful sight.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p26b" id="p26b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p26b.jpg (342K)" src="images/p26b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p26b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote, however, seeing such a swarm of Moors and hearing such a din,thought it would be right to aid the fugitives, and standing up heexclaimed in a loud voice, &ldquo;Never, while I live, will I permit foulplay to be practised in my presence on such a famous knight and fearlesslover as Don Gaiferos. Halt! ill-born rabble, follow him not nor pursuehim, or ye will have to reckon with me in battle!&rdquo; and suiting theaction to the word, he drew his sword, and with one bound placed himselfclose to the show, and with unexampled rapidity and fury began to showerdown blows on the puppet troop of Moors, knocking over some, decapitatingothers, maiming this one and demolishing that; and among many more hedelivered one down stroke which, if Master Pedro had not ducked, madehimself small, and got out of the way, would have sliced off his head aseasily as if it had been made of almond-paste. Master Pedro kept shouting,&ldquo;Hold hard! Señor Don Quixote! can&rsquo;t you see they&rsquo;re notreal Moors you&rsquo;re knocking down and killing and destroying, but onlylittle pasteboard figures! Look&mdash;sinner that I am!&mdash;how you&rsquo;rewrecking and ruining all that I&rsquo;m worth!&rdquo; But in spite ofthis, Don Quixote did not leave off discharging a continuous rain of cuts,slashes, downstrokes, and backstrokes, and at length, in less than thespace of two credos, he brought the whole show to the ground, with all itsfittings and figures shivered and knocked to pieces, King Marsilio badlywounded, and the Emperor Charlemagne with his crown and head split in two.The whole audience was thrown into confusion, the ape fled to the roof ofthe inn, the cousin was frightened, and even Sancho Panza himself was inmighty fear, for, as he swore after the storm was over, he had never seenhis master in such a furious passion.</p><p>The complete destruction of the show being thus accomplished, Don Quixotebecame a little calmer, said, &ldquo;I wish I had here before me now allthose who do not or will not believe how useful knights-errant are in theworld; just think, if I had not been here present, what would have becomeof the brave Don Gaiferos and the fair Melisendra! Depend upon it, by thistime those dogs would have overtaken them and inflicted some outrage uponthem. So, then, long live knight-errantry beyond everything living onearth this day!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let it live, and welcome,&rdquo; said Master Pedro at this in afeeble voice, &ldquo;and let me die, for I am so unfortunate that I cansay with King Don Rodrigo&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Yesterday was I lord of Spain<br/>To-day I&rsquo;ve not a turret left<br/>That I may call mine own.</p><p>Not half an hour, nay, barely a minute ago, I saw myself lord of kings andemperors, with my stables filled with countless horses, and my trunks andbags with gay dresses unnumbered; and now I find myself ruined and laidlow, destitute and a beggar, and above all without my ape, for, by myfaith, my teeth will have to sweat for it before I have him caught; andall through the reckless fury of sir knight here, who, they say, protectsthe fatherless, and rights wrongs, and does other charitable deeds; butwhose generous intentions have been found wanting in my case only, blessedand praised be the highest heavens! Verily, knight of the rueful figure hemust be to have disfigured mine.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho Panza was touched by Master Pedro&rsquo;s words, and said to him,&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t weep and lament, Master Pedro; you break my heart; letme tell you my master, Don Quixote, is so catholic and scrupulous aChristian that, if he can make out that he has done you any wrong, he willown it, and be willing to pay for it and make it good, and something overand above.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only let Señor Don Quixote pay me for some part of the work he hasdestroyed,&rdquo; said Master Pedro, &ldquo;and I would be content, andhis worship would ease his conscience, for he cannot be saved who keepswhat is another&rsquo;s against the owner&rsquo;s will, and makes norestitution.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but at present I amnot aware that I have got anything of yours, Master Pedro.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; returned Master Pedro; &ldquo;and these relics lyinghere on the bare hard ground&mdash;what scattered and shattered them butthe invincible strength of that mighty arm? And whose were the bodies theybelonged to but mine? And what did I get my living by but by them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now am I fully convinced,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;of what Ihad many a time before believed; that the enchanters who persecute me donothing more than put figures like these before my eyes, and then changeand turn them into what they please. In truth and earnest, I assure yougentlemen who now hear me, that to me everything that has taken place hereseemed to take place literally, that Melisendra was Melisendra, DonGaiferos Don Gaiferos, Marsilio Marsilio, and Charlemagne Charlemagne.That was why my anger was roused; and to be faithful to my calling as aknight-errant I sought to give aid and protection to those who fled, andwith this good intention I did what you have seen. If the result has beenthe opposite of what I intended, it is no fault of mine, but of thosewicked beings that persecute me; but, for all that, I am willing tocondemn myself in costs for this error of mine, though it did not proceedfrom malice; let Master Pedro see what he wants for the spoiled figures,for I agree to pay it at once in good and current money of Castile.&rdquo;</p><p>Master Pedro made him a bow, saying, &ldquo;I expected no less of the rareChristianity of the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, true helper andprotector of all destitute and needy vagabonds; master landlord here andthe great Sancho Panza shall be the arbitrators and appraisers betweenyour worship and me of what these dilapidated figures are worth or may beworth.&rdquo;</p><p>The landlord and Sancho consented, and then Master Pedro picked up fromthe ground King Marsilio of Saragossa with his head off, and said, &ldquo;Hereyou see how impossible it is to restore this king to his former state, soI think, saving your better judgments, that for his death, decease, anddemise, four reals and a half may be given me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, for this cleavage from top to bottom,&rdquo; continuedMaster Pedro, taking up the split Emperor Charlemagne, &ldquo;it would notbe much if I were to ask five reals and a quarter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not little,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Nor is it much,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;make it even, andsay five reals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let him have the whole five and a quarter,&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;for the sum total of this notable disaster does not stand on aquarter more or less; and make an end of it quickly, Master Pedro, for it&rsquo;sgetting on to supper-time, and I have some hints of hunger.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For this figure,&rdquo; said Master Pedro, &ldquo;that is without anose, and wants an eye, and is the fair Melisendra, I ask, and I amreasonable in my charge, two reals and twelve maravedis.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The very devil must be in it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;ifMelisendra and her husband are not by this time at least on the Frenchborder, for the horse they rode on seemed to me to fly rather than gallop;so you needn&rsquo;t try to sell me the cat for the hare, showing me herea noseless Melisendra when she is now, may be, enjoying herself at herease with her husband in France. God help every one to his own, MasterPedro, and let us all proceed fairly and honestly; and now go on.&rdquo;</p><p>Master Pedro, perceiving that Don Quixote was beginning to wander, andreturn to his original fancy, was not disposed to let him escape, so hesaid to him, &ldquo;This cannot be Melisendra, but must be one of thedamsels that waited on her; so if I&rsquo;m given sixty maravedis for her,I&rsquo;ll be content and sufficiently paid.&rdquo;</p><p>And so he went on, putting values on ever so many more smashed figures,which, after the two arbitrators had adjusted them to the satisfaction ofboth parties, came to forty reals and three-quarters; and over and abovethis sum, which Sancho at once disbursed, Master Pedro asked for two realsfor his trouble in catching the ape.</p><p>&ldquo;Let him have them, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;not tocatch the ape, but to get drunk; and two hundred would I give this minutefor the good news, to anyone who could tell me positively, that the ladyDoña Melisandra and Señor Don Gaiferos were now in France and with theirown people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No one could tell us that better than my ape,&rdquo; said MasterPedro; &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s no devil that could catch him now; Isuspect, however, that affection and hunger will drive him to come lookingfor me to-night; but to-morrow will soon be here and we shall see.&rdquo;</p><p>In short, the puppet-show storm passed off, and all supped in peace andgood fellowship at Don Quixote&rsquo;s expense, for he was the height ofgenerosity. Before it was daylight the man with the lances and halberdstook his departure, and soon after daybreak the cousin and the page cameto bid Don Quixote farewell, the former returning home, the latterresuming his journey, towards which, to help him, Don Quixote gave himtwelve reals. Master Pedro did not care to engage in any more palaver withDon Quixote, whom he knew right well; so he rose before the sun, andhaving got together the remains of his show and caught his ape, he toowent off to seek his adventures. The landlord, who did not know DonQuixote, was as much astonished at his mad freaks as at his generosity. Toconclude, Sancho, by his master&rsquo;s orders, paid him very liberally,and taking leave of him they quitted the inn at about eight in the morningand took to the road, where we will leave them to pursue their journey,for this is necessary in order to allow certain other matters to be setforth, which are required to clear up this famous history.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p26e" id="p26e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p26e.jpg (34K)" src="images/p26e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch27b" id="ch27b"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.<br/>WHEREIN IT IS SHOWN WHO MASTER PEDRO AND HIS APE WERE, TOGETHER WITH THEMISHAP DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE BRAYING ADVENTURE, WHICH HE DID NOT CONCLUDEAS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED OR AS HE HAD EXPECTED</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p27a" id="p27a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p27a.jpg (135K)" src="images/p27a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p27a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Cide Hamete, the chronicler of this great history, begins this chapterwith these words, &ldquo;I swear as a Catholic Christian;&rdquo; withregard to which his translator says that Cide Hamete&rsquo;s swearing as aCatholic Christian, he being&mdash;as no doubt he was&mdash;a Moor, onlymeant that, just as a Catholic Christian taking an oath swears, or oughtto swear, what is true, and tell the truth in what he avers, so he wastelling the truth, as much as if he swore as a Catholic Christian, in allhe chose to write about Quixote, especially in declaring who Master Pedrowas and what was the divining ape that astonished all the villages withhis divinations. He says, then, that he who has read the First Part ofthis history will remember well enough the Gines de Pasamonte whom, withother galley slaves, Don Quixote set free in the Sierra Morena: a kindnessfor which he afterwards got poor thanks and worse payment from thatevil-minded, ill-conditioned set. This Gines de Pasamonte&mdash;DonGinesillo de Parapilla, Don Quixote called him&mdash;it was that stoleDapple from Sancho Panza; which, because by the fault of the printersneither the how nor the when was stated in the First Part, has been apuzzle to a good many people, who attribute to the bad memory of theauthor what was the error of the press. In fact, however, Gines stole himwhile Sancho Panza was asleep on his back, adopting the plan and devicethat Brunello had recourse to when he stole Sacripante&rsquo;s horse frombetween his legs at the siege of Albracca; and, as has been told, Sanchoafterwards recovered him. This Gines, then, afraid of being caught by theofficers of justice, who were looking for him to punish him for hisnumberless rascalities and offences (which were so many and so great thathe himself wrote a big book giving an account of them), resolved to shifthis quarters into the kingdom of Aragon, and cover up his left eye, andtake up the trade of a puppet-showman; for this, as well as juggling, heknew how to practise to perfection. From some released Christiansreturning from Barbary, it so happened, he bought the ape, which he taughtto mount upon his shoulder on his making a certain sign, and to whisper,or seem to do so, in his ear. Thus prepared, before entering any villagewhither he was bound with his show and his ape, he used to inform himselfat the nearest village, or from the most likely person he could find, asto what particular things had happened there, and to whom; and bearingthem well in mind, the first thing he did was to exhibit his show,sometimes one story, sometimes another, but all lively, amusing, andfamiliar. As soon as the exhibition was over he brought forward theaccomplishments of his ape, assuring the public that he divined all thepast and the present, but as to the future he had no skill. For eachquestion answered he asked two reals, and for some he made a reduction,just as he happened to feel the pulse of the questioners; and when now andthen he came to houses where things that he knew of had happened to thepeople living there, even if they did not ask him a question, not caringto pay for it, he would make the sign to the ape and then declare that ithad said so and so, which fitted the case exactly. In this way he acquireda prodigious name and all ran after him; on other occasions, being verycrafty, he would answer in such a way that the answers suited thequestions; and as no one cross-questioned him or pressed him to tell howhis ape divined, he made fools of them all and filled his pouch. Theinstant he entered the inn he knew Don Quixote and Sancho, and with thatknowledge it was easy for him to astonish them and all who were there; butit would have cost him dear had Don Quixote brought down his hand a littlelower when he cut off King Marsilio&rsquo;s head and destroyed all hishorsemen, as related in the preceeding chapter.</p><p>So much for Master Pedro and his ape; and now to return to Don Quixote ofLa Mancha. After he had left the inn he determined to visit, first of all,the banks of the Ebro and that neighbourhood, before entering the city ofSaragossa, for the ample time there was still to spare before the joustsleft him enough for all. With this object in view he followed the road andtravelled along it for two days, without meeting any adventure worthcommitting to writing until on the third day, as he was ascending a hill,he heard a great noise of drums, trumpets, and musket-shots. At first heimagined some regiment of soldiers was passing that way, and to see themhe spurred Rocinante and mounted the hill. On reaching the top he saw atthe foot of it over two hundred men, as it seemed to him, armed withweapons of various sorts, lances, crossbows, partisans, halberds, andpikes, and a few muskets and a great many bucklers. He descended the slopeand approached the band near enough to see distinctly the flags, make outthe colours and distinguish the devices they bore, especially one on astandard or ensign of white satin, on which there was painted in a verylife-like style an ass like a little sard, with its head up, its mouthopen and its tongue out, as if it were in the act and attitude of braying;and round it were inscribed in large characters these two lines&mdash;</p><p class="poem">They did not bray in vain,<br/>Our alcaldes twain.</p><p>From this device Don Quixote concluded that these people must be from thebraying town, and he said so to Sancho, explaining to him what was writtenon the standard. At the same time be observed that the man who had toldthem about the matter was wrong in saying that the two who brayed wereregidors, for according to the lines of the standard they were alcaldes.To which Sancho replied, &ldquo;Señor, there&rsquo;s nothing to stick atin that, for maybe the regidors who brayed then came to be alcaldes oftheir town afterwards, and so they may go by both titles; moreover, it hasnothing to do with the truth of the story whether the brayers werealcaldes or regidors, provided at any rate they did bray; for an alcaldeis just as likely to bray as a regidor.&rdquo; They perceived, in short,clearly that the town which had been twitted had turned out to do battlewith some other that had jeered it more than was fair or neighbourly.</p><p>Don Quixote proceeded to join them, not a little to Sancho&rsquo;suneasiness, for he never relished mixing himself up in expeditions of thatsort. The members of the troop received him into the midst of them, takinghim to be someone who was on their side. Don Quixote, putting up hisvisor, advanced with an easy bearing and demeanour to the standard withthe ass, and all the chief men of the army gathered round him to look athim, staring at him with the usual amazement that everybody felt on seeinghim for the first time. Don Quixote, seeing them examining him soattentively, and that none of them spoke to him or put any question tohim, determined to take advantage of their silence; so, breaking his own,he lifted up his voice and said, &ldquo;Worthy sirs, I entreat you asearnestly as I can not to interrupt an argument I wish to address to you,until you find it displeases or wearies you; and if that come to pass, onthe slightest hint you give me I will put a seal upon my lips and a gagupon my tongue.&rdquo;</p><p>They all bade him say what he liked, for they would listen to himwillingly.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p27b" id="p27b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p27b.jpg (330K)" src="images/p27b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p27b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>With this permission Don Quixote went on to say, &ldquo;I, sirs, am aknight-errant whose calling is that of arms, and whose profession is toprotect those who require protection, and give help to such as stand inneed of it. Some days ago I became acquainted with your misfortune and thecause which impels you to take up arms again and again to revengeyourselves upon your enemies; and having many times thought over yourbusiness in my mind, I find that, according to the laws of combat, you aremistaken in holding yourselves insulted; for a private individual cannotinsult an entire community; unless it be by defying it collectively as atraitor, because he cannot tell who in particular is guilty of the treasonfor which he defies it. Of this we have an example in Don Diego Ordoñez deLara, who defied the whole town of Zamora, because he did not know thatVellido Dolfos alone had committed the treachery of slaying his king; andtherefore he defied them all, and the vengeance and the reply concernedall; though, to be sure, Señor Don Diego went rather too far, indeed verymuch beyond the limits of a defiance; for he had no occasion to defy thedead, or the waters, or the fishes, or those yet unborn, and all the restof it as set forth; but let that pass, for when anger breaks out there&rsquo;sno father, governor, or bridle to check the tongue. The case being, then,that no one person can insult a kingdom, province, city, state, or entirecommunity, it is clear there is no reason for going out to avenge thedefiance of such an insult, inasmuch as it is not one. A fine thing itwould be if the people of the clock town were to be at loggerheads everymoment with everyone who called them by that name,&mdash;or the Cazoleros,Berengeneros, Ballenatos, Jaboneros, or the bearers of all the other namesand titles that are always in the mouth of the boys and common people! Itwould be a nice business indeed if all these illustrious cities were totake huff and revenge themselves and go about perpetually making trombonesof their swords in every petty quarrel! No, no; God forbid! There are fourthings for which sensible men and well-ordered States ought to take uparms, draw their swords, and risk their persons, lives, and properties.The first is to defend the Catholic faith; the second, to defend one&rsquo;slife, which is in accordance with natural and divine law; the third, indefence of one&rsquo;s honour, family, and property; the fourth, in theservice of one&rsquo;s king in a just war; and if to these we choose toadd a fifth (which may be included in the second), in defence of one&rsquo;scountry. To these five, as it were capital causes, there may be added someothers that may be just and reasonable, and make it a duty to take uparms; but to take them up for trifles and things to laugh at and be amusedby rather than offended, looks as though he who did so was altogetherwanting in common sense. Moreover, to take an unjust revenge (and therecannot be any just one) is directly opposed to the sacred law that weacknowledge, wherein we are commanded to do good to our enemies and tolove them that hate us; a command which, though it seems somewhatdifficult to obey, is only so to those who have in them less of God thanof the world, and more of the flesh than of the spirit; for Jesus Christ,God and true man, who never lied, and could not and cannot lie, said, asour law-giver, that his yoke was easy and his burden light; he would not,therefore, have laid any command upon us that it was impossible to obey.Thus, sirs, you are bound to keep quiet by human and divine law.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The devil take me,&rdquo; said Sancho to himself at this, &ldquo;butthis master of mine is a theologian; or, if not, faith, he&rsquo;s as likeone as one egg is like another.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote stopped to take breath, and, observing that silence was stillpreserved, had a mind to continue his discourse, and would have done sohad not Sancho interposed with his smartness; for he, seeing his masterpause, took the lead, saying, &ldquo;My lord Don Quixote of La Mancha, whoonce was called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, but now is calledthe Knight of the Lions, is a gentleman of great discretion who knowsLatin and his mother tongue like a bachelor, and in everything that hedeals with or advises proceeds like a good soldier, and has all the lawsand ordinances of what they call combat at his fingers&rsquo; ends; so youhave nothing to do but to let yourselves be guided by what he says, and onmy head be it if it is wrong. Besides which, you have been told that it isfolly to take offence at merely hearing a bray. I remember when I was aboy I brayed as often as I had a fancy, without anyone hindering me, andso elegantly and naturally that when I brayed all the asses in the townwould bray; but I was none the less for that the son of my parents whowere greatly respected; and though I was envied because of the gift bymore than one of the high and mighty ones of the town, I did not care twofarthings for it; and that you may see I am telling the truth, wait a bitand listen, for this art, like swimming, once learnt is never forgotten;&rdquo;and then, taking hold of his nose, he began to bray so vigorously that allthe valleys around rang again.</p><p>One of those, however, that stood near him, fancying he was mocking them,lifted up a long staff he had in his hand and smote him such a blow withit that Sancho dropped helpless to the ground. Don Quixote, seeing him soroughly handled, attacked the man who had struck him lance in hand, but somany thrust themselves between them that he could not avenge him. Far fromit, finding a shower of stones rained upon him, and crossbows and musketsunnumbered levelled at him, he wheeled Rocinante round and, as fast as hisbest gallop could take him, fled from the midst of them, commendinghimself to God with all his heart to deliver him out of this peril, indread every step of some ball coming in at his back and coming out at hisbreast, and every minute drawing his breath to see whether it had gonefrom him. The members of the band, however, were satisfied with seeing himtake to flight, and did not fire on him. They put up Sancho, scarcelyrestored to his senses, on his ass, and let him go after his master; notthat he was sufficiently in his wits to guide the beast, but Dapplefollowed the footsteps of Rocinante, from whom he could not remain amoment separated. Don Quixote having got some way off looked back, andseeing Sancho coming, waited for him, as he perceived that no one followedhim. The men of the troop stood their ground till night, and as the enemydid not come out to battle, they returned to their town exulting; and hadthey been aware of the ancient custom of the Greeks, they would haveerected a trophy on the spot.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p27e" id="p27e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p27e.jpg (47K)" src="images/p27e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p27e.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch28b" id="ch28b"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br/>OF MATTERS THAT BENENGELI SAYS HE WHO READS THEM WILL KNOW, IF HE READSTHEM WITH ATTENTION</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p28a" id="p28a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p28a.jpg (111K)" src="images/p28a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p28a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>When the brave man flees, treachery is manifest and it is for wise men toreserve themselves for better occasions. This proved to be the case withDon Quixote, who, giving way before the fury of the townsfolk and thehostile intentions of the angry troop, took to flight and, without athought of Sancho or the danger in which he was leaving him, retreated tosuch a distance as he thought made him safe. Sancho, lying across his ass,followed him, as has been said, and at length came up, having by this timerecovered his senses, and on joining him let himself drop off Dapple atRocinante&rsquo;s feet, sore, bruised, and belaboured. Don Quixotedismounted to examine his wounds, but finding him whole from head to foot,he said to him, angrily enough, &ldquo;In an evil hour didst thou take tobraying, Sancho! Where hast thou learned that it is well done to mentionthe rope in the house of the man that has been hanged? To the music ofbrays what harmonies couldst thou expect to get but cudgels? Give thanksto God, Sancho, that they signed the cross on thee just now with a stick,and did not mark thee <i>per signum crucis</i> with a cutlass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not equal to answering,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for Ifeel as if I was speaking through my shoulders; let us mount and get awayfrom this; I&rsquo;ll keep from braying, but not from saying thatknights-errant fly and leave their good squires to be pounded like privet,or made meal of at the hands of their enemies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He does not fly who retires,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote; &ldquo;forI would have thee know, Sancho, that the valour which is not based upon afoundation of prudence is called rashness, and the exploits of the rashman are to be attributed rather to good fortune than to courage; and so Iown that I retired, but not that I fled; and therein I have followed theexample of many valiant men who have reserved themselves for better times;the histories are full of instances of this, but as it would not be anygood to thee or pleasure to me, I will not recount them to thee now.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho was by this time mounted with the help of Don Quixote, who thenhimself mounted Rocinante, and at a leisurely pace they proceeded to takeshelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a league off.Every now and then Sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismal groans, andon Don Quixote asking him what caused such acute suffering, he repliedthat, from the end of his back-bone up to the nape of his neck, he was sosore that it nearly drove him out of his senses.</p><p>&ldquo;The cause of that soreness,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;willbe, no doubt, that the staff wherewith they smote thee being a very longone, it caught thee all down the back, where all the parts that are soreare situated, and had it reached any further thou wouldst be sorer still.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;your worship has relieved me ofa great doubt, and cleared up the point for me in elegant style! Body o&rsquo;me! is the cause of my soreness such a mystery that there&rsquo;s any needto tell me I am sore everywhere the staff hit me? If it was my ankles thatpained me there might be something in going divining why they did, but itis not much to divine that I&rsquo;m sore where they thrashed me. By myfaith, master mine, the ills of others hang by a hair; every day I amdiscovering more and more how little I have to hope for from keepingcompany with your worship; for if this time you have allowed me to bedrubbed, the next time, or a hundred times more, we&rsquo;ll have theblanketings of the other day over again, and all the other pranks which,if they have fallen on my shoulders now, will be thrown in my teethby-and-by. I would do a great deal better (if I was not an ignorant brutethat will never do any good all my life), I would do a great deal better,I say, to go home to my wife and children and support them and bring themup on what God may please to give me, instead of following your worshipalong roads that lead nowhere and paths that are none at all, with littleto drink and less to eat. And then when it comes to sleeping! Measure outseven feet on the earth, brother squire, and if that&rsquo;s not enoughfor you, take as many more, for you may have it all your own way andstretch yourself to your heart&rsquo;s content. Oh that I could see burntand turned to ashes the first man that meddled with knight-errantry or atany rate the first who chose to be squire to such fools as all theknights-errant of past times must have been! Of those of the present day Isay nothing, because, as your worship is one of them, I respect them, andbecause I know your worship knows a point more than the devil in all yousay and think.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would lay a good wager with you, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;that now that you are talking on without anyone to stop you, youdon&rsquo;t feel a pain in your whole body. Talk away, my son, saywhatever comes into your head or mouth, for so long as you feel no pain,the irritation your impertinences give me will be a pleasure to me; and ifyou are so anxious to go home to your wife and children, God forbid that Ishould prevent you; you have money of mine; see how long it is since weleft our village this third time, and how much you can and ought to earnevery month, and pay yourself out of your own hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When I worked for Tom Carrasco, the father of the bachelor SamsonCarrasco that your worship knows,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;I used toearn two ducats a month besides my food; I can&rsquo;t tell what I canearn with your worship, though I know a knight-errant&rsquo;s squire hasharder times of it than he who works for a farmer; for after all, we whowork for farmers, however much we toil all day, at the worst, at night, wehave our olla supper and sleep in a bed, which I have not slept in since Ihave been in your worship&rsquo;s service, if it wasn&rsquo;t the shorttime we were in Don Diego de Miranda&rsquo;s house, and the feast I hadwith the skimmings I took off Camacho&rsquo;s pots, and what I ate, drank,and slept in Basilio&rsquo;s house; all the rest of the time I have beensleeping on the hard ground under the open sky, exposed to what they callthe inclemencies of heaven, keeping life in me with scraps of cheese andcrusts of bread, and drinking water either from the brooks or from thesprings we come to on these by-paths we travel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I own, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that all thou sayestis true; how much, thinkest thou, ought I to give thee over and above whatTom Carrasco gave thee?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that if your worship was to addon two reals a month I&rsquo;d consider myself well paid; that is, as faras the wages of my labour go; but to make up to me for your worship&rsquo;spledge and promise to me to give me the government of an island, it wouldbe fair to add six reals more, making thirty in all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;it is twenty-five dayssince we left our village, so reckon up, Sancho, according to the wagesyou have made out for yourself, and see how much I owe you in proportion,and pay yourself, as I said before, out of your own hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O body o&rsquo; me!&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but your worship isvery much out in that reckoning; for when it comes to the promise of theisland we must count from the day your worship promised it to me to thispresent hour we are at now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, how long is it, Sancho, since I promised it to you?&rdquo;said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;If I remember rightly,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;it must be overtwenty years, three days more or less.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote gave himself a great slap on the forehead and began to laughheartily, and said he, &ldquo;Why, I have not been wandering, either in theSierra Morena or in the whole course of our sallies, but barely two months, andthou sayest, Sancho, that it is twenty years since I promised thee the island.I believe now thou wouldst have all the money thou hast of mine go in thywages. If so, and if that be thy pleasure, I give it to thee now, once and forall, and much good may it do thee, for so long as I see myself rid of such agood-for-nothing squire I&rsquo;ll be glad to be left a pauper without a rap.But tell me, thou perverter of the squirely rules of knight-errantry, wherehast thou ever seen or read that any knight-errant&rsquo;s squire made termswith his lord, &lsquo;you must give me so much a month for serving you&rsquo;?Plunge, scoundrel, rogue, monster&mdash;for such I take thee tobe&mdash;plunge, I say, into the <i>mare magnum</i> of their histories; and ifthou shalt find that any squire ever said or thought what thou hast said now, Iwill let thee nail it on my forehead, and give me, over and above, four soundslaps in the face. Turn the rein, or the halter, of thy Dapple, and begonehome; for one single step further thou shalt not make in my company. O breadthanklessly received! O promises ill-bestowed! O man more beast than humanbeing! Now, when I was about to raise thee to such a position, that, in spiteof thy wife, they would call thee &lsquo;my lord,&rsquo; thou art leaving me?Thou art going now when I had a firm and fixed intention of making thee lord ofthe best island in the world? Well, as thou thyself hast said before now, honeyis not for the mouth of the ass. Ass thou art, ass thou wilt be, and ass thouwilt end when the course of thy life is run; for I know it will come to itsclose before thou dost perceive or discern that thou art a beast.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho regarded Don Quixote earnestly while he was giving him this rating,and was so touched by remorse that the tears came to his eyes, and in apiteous and broken voice he said to him, &ldquo;Master mine, I confessthat, to be a complete ass, all I want is a tail; if your worship willonly fix one on to me, I&rsquo;ll look on it as rightly placed, and I&rsquo;llserve you as an ass all the remaining days of my life. Forgive me and havepity on my folly, and remember I know but little, and, if I talk much, it&rsquo;smore from infirmity than malice; but he who sins and mends commendshimself to God.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should have been surprised, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;if thou hadst not introduced some bit of a proverb into thy speech.Well, well, I forgive thee, provided thou dost mend and not show thyselfin future so fond of thine own interest, but try to be of good cheer andtake heart, and encourage thyself to look forward to the fulfillment of mypromises, which, by being delayed, does not become impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho said he would do so, and keep up his heart as best he could. Theythen entered the grove, and Don Quixote settled himself at the foot of anelm, and Sancho at that of a beech, for trees of this kind and others likethem always have feet but no hands. Sancho passed the night in pain, forwith the evening dews the blow of the staff made itself felt all the more.Don Quixote passed it in his never-failing meditations; but, for all that,they had some winks of sleep, and with the appearance of daylight theypursued their journey in quest of the banks of the famous Ebro, where thatbefell them which will be told in the following chapter.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p28e" id="p28e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p28e.jpg (36K)" src="images/p28e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch29b" id="ch29b"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.<br/>OF THE FAMOUS ADVENTURE OF THE ENCHANTED BARK</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p29a" id="p29a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p29a.jpg (127K)" src="images/p29a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p29a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>By stages as already described or left undescribed, two days afterquitting the grove Don Quixote and Sancho reached the river Ebro, and thesight of it was a great delight to Don Quixote as he contemplated andgazed upon the charms of its banks, the clearness of its stream, thegentleness of its current and the abundance of its crystal waters; and thepleasant view revived a thousand tender thoughts in his mind. Above all,he dwelt upon what he had seen in the cave of Montesinos; for thoughMaster Pedro&rsquo;s ape had told him that of those things part was true,part false, he clung more to their truth than to their falsehood, the veryreverse of Sancho, who held them all to be downright lies.</p><p>As they were thus proceeding, then, they discovered a small boat, withoutoars or any other gear, that lay at the water&rsquo;s edge tied to thestem of a tree growing on the bank. Don Quixote looked all round, andseeing nobody, at once, without more ado, dismounted from Rocinante andbade Sancho get down from Dapple and tie both beasts securely to the trunkof a poplar or willow that stood there. Sancho asked him the reason ofthis sudden dismounting and tying. Don Quixote made answer, &ldquo;Thoumust know, Sancho, that this bark is plainly, and without the possibilityof any alternative, calling and inviting me to enter it, and in it go togive aid to some knight or other person of distinction in need of it, whois no doubt in some sore strait; for this is the way of the books ofchivalry and of the enchanters who figure and speak in them. When a knightis involved in some difficulty from which he cannot be delivered save bythe hand of another knight, though they may be at a distance of two orthree thousand leagues or more one from the other, they either take him upon a cloud, or they provide a bark for him to get into, and in less thanthe twinkling of an eye they carry him where they will and where his helpis required; and so, Sancho, this bark is placed here for the samepurpose; this is as true as that it is now day, and ere this one passestie Dapple and Rocinante together, and then in God&rsquo;s hand be it toguide us; for I would not hold back from embarking, though barefootedfriars were to beg me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and yourworship chooses to give in to these&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if I may callthem absurdities&mdash;at every turn, there&rsquo;s nothing for it but toobey and bow the head, bearing in mind the proverb, &lsquo;Do as thymaster bids thee, and sit down to table with him;&rsquo; but for all that,for the sake of easing my conscience, I warn your worship that it is myopinion this bark is no enchanted one, but belongs to some of thefishermen of the river, for they catch the best shad in the world here.&rdquo;</p><p>As Sancho said this, he tied the beasts, leaving them to the care andprotection of the enchanters with sorrow enough in his heart. Don Quixotebade him not be uneasy about deserting the animals, &ldquo;for he whowould carry themselves over such longinquous roads and regions would takecare to feed them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that logiquous,&rdquo; said Sancho,&ldquo;nor have I ever heard the word all the days of my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Longinquous,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;means far off; butit is no wonder thou dost not understand it, for thou art not bound toknow Latin, like some who pretend to know it and don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now they are tied,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;what are we to donext?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;cross ourselves and weighanchor; I mean, embark and cut the moorings by which the bark is held;&rdquo;and the bark began to drift away slowly from the bank. But when Sancho sawhimself somewhere about two yards out in the river, he began to trembleand give himself up for lost; but nothing distressed him more than hearingDapple bray and seeing Rocinante struggling to get loose, and said he tohis master, &ldquo;Dapple is braying in grief at our leaving him, andRocinante is trying to escape and plunge in after us. O dear friends,peace be with you, and may this madness that is taking us away from you,turned into sober sense, bring us back to you.&rdquo; And with this hefell weeping so bitterly, that Don Quixote said to him, sharply andangrily, &ldquo;What art thou afraid of, cowardly creature? What art thouweeping at, heart of butter-paste? Who pursues or molests thee, thou soulof a tame mouse? What dost thou want, unsatisfied in the very heart ofabundance? Art thou, perchance, tramping barefoot over the Riphaeanmountains, instead of being seated on a bench like an archduke on thetranquil stream of this pleasant river, from which in a short space weshall come out upon the broad sea? But we must have already emerged andgone seven hundred or eight hundred leagues; and if I had here anastrolabe to take the altitude of the pole, I could tell thee how many wehave travelled, though either I know little, or we have already crossed orshall shortly cross the equinoctial line which parts the two oppositepoles midway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And when we come to that line your worship speaks of,&rdquo; saidSancho, &ldquo;how far shall we have gone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very far,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for of the three hundredand sixty degrees that this terraqueous globe contains, as computed byPtolemy, the greatest cosmographer known, we shall have travelled one-halfwhen we come to the line I spoke of.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;your worship gives me a niceauthority for what you say, putrid Dolly something transmogrified, orwhatever it is.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote laughed at the interpretation Sancho put upon &ldquo;computed,&rdquo;and the name of the cosmographer Ptolemy, and said he, &ldquo;Thou mustknow, Sancho, that with the Spaniards and those who embark at Cadiz forthe East Indies, one of the signs they have to show them when they havepassed the equinoctial line I told thee of, is, that the lice die uponeverybody on board the ship, and not a single one is left, or to be foundin the whole vessel if they gave its weight in gold for it; so, Sancho,thou mayest as well pass thy hand down thy thigh, and if thou comest uponanything alive we shall be no longer in doubt; if not, then we havecrossed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a bit of it,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;still,I&rsquo;ll do as your worship bids me; though I don&rsquo;t know what needthere is for trying these experiments, for I can see with my own eyes thatwe have not moved five yards away from the bank, or shifted two yards fromwhere the animals stand, for there are Rocinante and Dapple in the verysame place where we left them; and watching a point, as I do now, I swearby all that&rsquo;s good, we are not stirring or moving at the pace of anant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Try the test I told thee of, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t mind any other, for thou knowest nothing aboutcolures, lines, parallels, zodiacs, ecliptics, poles, solstices,equinoxes, planets, signs, bearings, the measures of which the celestialand terrestrial spheres are composed; if thou wert acquainted with allthese things, or any portion of them, thou wouldst see clearly how manyparallels we have cut, what signs we have seen, and what constellations wehave left behind and are now leaving behind. But again I tell thee, feeland hunt, for I am certain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth whitepaper.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho felt, and passing his hand gently and carefully down to the hollowof his left knee, he looked up at his master and said, &ldquo;Either thetest is a false one, or we have not come to where your worship says, norwithin many leagues of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, how so?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote; &ldquo;hast thou come uponaught?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ay, and aughts,&rdquo; replied Sancho; and shaking his fingers hewashed his whole hand in the river along which the boat was quietlygliding in midstream, not moved by any occult intelligence or invisibleenchanter, but simply by the current, just there smooth and gentle.</p><p>They now came in sight of some large water mills that stood in the middleof the river, and the instant Don Quixote saw them he cried out, &ldquo;Seestthou there, my friend? there stands the castle or fortress, where thereis, no doubt, some knight in durance, or ill-used queen, or infanta, orprincess, in whose aid I am brought hither.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What the devil city, fortress, or castle is your worship talkingabout, señor?&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see that thoseare mills that stand in the river to grind corn?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold thy peace, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;though theylook like mills they are not so; I have already told thee thatenchantments transform things and change their proper shapes; I do notmean to say they really change them from one form into another, but thatit seems as though they did, as experience proved in the transformation ofDulcinea, sole refuge of my hopes.&rdquo;</p><p>By this time, the boat, having reached the middle of the stream, began tomove less slowly than hitherto. The millers belonging to the mills, whenthey saw the boat coming down the river, and on the point of being suckedin by the draught of the wheels, ran out in haste, several of them, withlong poles to stop it, and being all mealy, with faces and garmentscovered with flour, they presented a sinister appearance. They raised loudshouts, crying, &ldquo;Devils of men, where are you going to? Are you mad?Do you want to drown yourselves, or dash yourselves to pieces among thesewheels?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did I not tell thee, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote at this,&ldquo;that we had reached the place where I am to show what the might ofmy arm can do? See what ruffians and villains come out against me; seewhat monsters oppose me; see what hideous countenances come to frightenus! You shall soon see, scoundrels!&rdquo; And then standing up in theboat he began in a loud voice to hurl threats at the millers, exclaiming,&ldquo;Ill-conditioned and worse-counselled rabble, restore to liberty andfreedom the person ye hold in durance in this your fortress or prison,high or low or of whatever rank or quality he be, for I am Don Quixote ofLa Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of the Lions, for whom, by thedisposition of heaven above, it is reserved to give a happy issue to thisadventure;&rdquo; and so saying he drew his sword and began making passesin the air at the millers, who, hearing but not understanding all thisnonsense, strove to stop the boat, which was now getting into the rushingchannel of the wheels. Sancho fell upon his knees devoutly appealing toheaven to deliver him from such imminent peril; which it did by theactivity and quickness of the millers, who, pushing against the boat withtheir poles, stopped it, not, however, without upsetting and throwing DonQuixote and Sancho into the water; and lucky it was for Don Quixote thathe could swim like a goose, though the weight of his armour carried himtwice to the bottom; and had it not been for the millers, who plunged inand hoisted them both out, it would have been Troy town with the pair ofthem. As soon as, more drenched than thirsty, they were landed, Sanchowent down on his knees and with clasped hands and eyes raised to heaven,prayed a long and fervent prayer to God to deliver him evermore from therash projects and attempts of his master. The fishermen, the owners of theboat, which the mill-wheels had knocked to pieces, now came up, and seeingit smashed they proceeded to strip Sancho and to demand payment for itfrom Don Quixote; but he with great calmness, just as if nothing hadhappened him, told the millers and fishermen that he would pay for thebark most cheerfully, on condition that they delivered up to him, free andunhurt, the person or persons that were in durance in that castle oftheirs.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p29b" id="p29b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p29b.jpg (314K)" src="images/p29b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p29b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What persons or what castle art thou talking of, madman? Art thoufor carrying off the people who come to grind corn in these mills?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said Don Quixote to himself, &ldquo;itwould be preaching in the desert to attempt by entreaties to induce thisrabble to do any virtuous action. In this adventure two mighty enchantersmust have encountered one another, and one frustrates what the otherattempts; one provided the bark for me, and the other upset me; God helpus, this world is all machinations and schemes at cross purposes one withthe other. I can do no more.&rdquo; And then turning towards the mills hesaid aloud, &ldquo;Friends, whoe&rsquo;er ye be that are immured in thatprison, forgive me that, to my misfortune and yours, I cannot deliver youfrom your misery; this adventure is doubtless reserved and destined forsome other knight.&rdquo;</p><p>So saying he settled with the fishermen, and paid fifty reals for theboat, which Sancho handed to them very much against the grain, saying,&ldquo;With a couple more bark businesses like this we shall have sunk ourwhole capital.&rdquo;</p><p>The fishermen and the millers stood staring in amazement at the twofigures, so very different to all appearance from ordinary men, and werewholly unable to make out the drift of the observations and questions DonQuixote addressed to them; and coming to the conclusion that they weremadmen, they left them and betook themselves, the millers to their mills,and the fishermen to their huts. Don Quixote and Sancho returned to theirbeasts, and to their life of beasts, and so ended the adventure of theenchanted bark.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p29e" id="p29e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p29e.jpg (54K)" src="images/p29e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch30b" id="ch30b"></a>CHAPTER XXX.<br/>OF DON QUIXOTE&rsquo;S ADVENTURE WITH A FAIR HUNTRESS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p30a" id="p30a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p30a.jpg (134K)" src="images/p30a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p30a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>They reached their beasts in low spirits and bad humour enough, knight andsquire, Sancho particularly, for with him what touched the stock of moneytouched his heart, and when any was taken from him he felt as if he wasrobbed of the apples of his eyes. In fine, without exchanging a word, theymounted and quitted the famous river, Don Quixote absorbed in thoughts ofhis love, Sancho in thinking of his advancement, which just then, itseemed to him, he was very far from securing; for, fool as he was, he sawclearly enough that his master&rsquo;s acts were all or most of themutterly senseless; and he began to cast about for an opportunity ofretiring from his service and going home some day, without entering intoany explanations or taking any farewell of him. Fortune, however, orderedmatters after a fashion very much the opposite of what he contemplated.</p><p>It so happened that the next day towards sunset, on coming out of a wood,Don Quixote cast his eyes over a green meadow, and at the far end of itobserved some people, and as he drew nearer saw that it was a hawkingparty. Coming closer, he distinguished among them a lady of graceful mien,on a pure white palfrey or hackney caparisoned with green trappings and asilver-mounted side-saddle. The lady was also in green, and so richly andsplendidly dressed that splendour itself seemed personified in her. On herleft hand she bore a hawk, a proof to Don Quixote&rsquo;s mind that shemust be some great lady and the mistress of the whole hunting party, whichwas the fact; so he said to Sancho, &ldquo;Run Sancho, my son, and say tothat lady on the palfrey with the hawk that I, the Knight of the Lions,kiss the hands of her exalted beauty, and if her excellence will grant meleave I will go and kiss them in person and place myself at her servicefor aught that may be in my power and her highness may command; and mind,Sancho, how thou speakest, and take care not to thrust in any of thyproverbs into thy message.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p30b" id="p30b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p30b.jpg (334K)" src="images/p30b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p30b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a likely one here to thrust any in!&rdquo; saidSancho; &ldquo;leave me alone for that! Why, this is not the first time inmy life I have carried messages to high and exalted ladies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Except that thou didst carry to the lady Dulcinea,&rdquo; said DonQuixote, &ldquo;I know not that thou hast carried any other, at least inmy service.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; replied Sancho; &ldquo;but pledges don&rsquo;tdistress a good payer, and in a house where there&rsquo;s plenty supper issoon cooked; I mean there&rsquo;s no need of telling or warning me aboutanything; for I&rsquo;m ready for everything and know a little ofeverything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I believe, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;go and goodluck to thee, and God speed thee.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho went off at top speed, forcing Dapple out of his regular pace, andcame to where the fair huntress was standing, and dismounting knelt beforeher and said, &ldquo;Fair lady, that knight that you see there, the Knightof the Lions by name, is my master, and I am a squire of his, and at homethey call me Sancho Panza. This same Knight of the Lions, who was callednot long since the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, sends by me to saymay it please your highness to give him leave that, with your permission,approbation, and consent, he may come and carry out his wishes, which are,as he says and I believe, to serve your exalted loftiness and beauty; andif you give it, your ladyship will do a thing which will redound to yourhonour, and he will receive a most distinguished favour and happiness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have indeed, squire,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;deliveredyour message with all the formalities such messages require; rise up, forit is not right that the squire of a knight so great as he of the RuefulCountenance, of whom we have heard a great deal here, should remain on hisknees; rise, my friend, and bid your master welcome to the services ofmyself and the duke my husband, in a country house we have here.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho got up, charmed as much by the beauty of the good lady as by herhigh-bred air and her courtesy, but, above all, by what she had said abouthaving heard of his master, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance; for ifshe did not call him Knight of the Lions it was no doubt because he had solately taken the name. &ldquo;Tell me, brother squire,&rdquo; asked theduchess (whose title, however, is not known), &ldquo;this master of yours,is he not one of whom there is a history extant in print, called &lsquo;TheIngenious Gentleman, Don Quixote of La Mancha,&rsquo; who has for the ladyof his heart a certain Dulcinea del Toboso?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is the same, señora,&rdquo; replied Sancho; &ldquo;and thatsquire of his who figures, or ought to figure, in the said history underthe name of Sancho Panza, is myself, unless they have changed me in thecradle, I mean in the press.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am rejoiced at all this,&rdquo; said the duchess; &ldquo;go,brother Panza, and tell your master that he is welcome to my estate, andthat nothing could happen to me that could give me greater pleasure.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho returned to his master mightily pleased with this gratifyinganswer, and told him all the great lady had said to him, lauding to theskies, in his rustic phrase, her rare beauty, her graceful gaiety, and hercourtesy. Don Quixote drew himself up briskly in his saddle, fixed himselfin his stirrups, settled his visor, gave Rocinante the spur, and with aneasy bearing advanced to kiss the hands of the duchess, who, having sentto summon the duke her husband, told him while Don Quixote was approachingall about the message; and as both of them had read the First Part of thishistory, and from it were aware of Don Quixote&rsquo;s crazy turn, theyawaited him with the greatest delight and anxiety to make hisacquaintance, meaning to fall in with his humour and agree with everythinghe said, and, so long as he stayed with them, to treat him as aknight-errant, with all the ceremonies usual in the books of chivalry theyhad read, for they themselves were very fond of them.</p><p>Don Quixote now came up with his visor raised, and as he seemed about todismount Sancho made haste to go and hold his stirrup for him; but ingetting down off Dapple he was so unlucky as to hitch his foot in one ofthe ropes of the pack-saddle in such a way that he was unable to free it,and was left hanging by it with his face and breast on the ground. DonQuixote, who was not used to dismount without having the stirrup held,fancying that Sancho had by this time come to hold it for him, threwhimself off with a lurch and brought Rocinante&rsquo;s saddle after him,which was no doubt badly girthed, and saddle and he both came to theground; not without discomfiture to him and abundant curses mutteredbetween his teeth against the unlucky Sancho, who had his foot still inthe shackles. The duke ordered his huntsmen to go to the help of knightand squire, and they raised Don Quixote, sorely shaken by his fall; andhe, limping, advanced as best he could to kneel before the noble pair.This, however, the duke would by no means permit; on the contrary,dismounting from his horse, he went and embraced Don Quixote, saying,&ldquo;I am grieved, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, that your firstexperience on my ground should have been such an unfortunate one as wehave seen; but the carelessness of squires is often the cause of worseaccidents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That which has happened me in meeting you, mighty prince,&rdquo;replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;cannot be unfortunate, even if my fall had notstopped short of the depths of the bottomless pit, for the glory of havingseen you would have lifted me up and delivered me from it. My squire, God&rsquo;scurse upon him, is better at unloosing his tongue in talking impertinencethan in tightening the girths of a saddle to keep it steady; but however Imay be, fallen or raised up, on foot or on horseback, I shall always be atyour service and that of my lady the duchess, your worthy consort, worthyqueen of beauty and paramount princess of courtesy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gently, Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha,&rdquo; said the duke;&ldquo;where my lady Doña Dulcinea del Toboso is, it is not right thatother beauties should be praised.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho, by this time released from his entanglement, was standing by, andbefore his master could answer he said, &ldquo;There is no denying, and itmust be maintained, that my lady Dulcinea del Toboso is very beautiful;but the hare jumps up where one least expects it; and I have heard saythat what we call nature is like a potter that makes vessels of clay, andhe who makes one fair vessel can as well make two, or three, or a hundred;I say so because, by my faith, my lady the duchess is in no way behind mymistress the lady Dulcinea del Toboso.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote turned to the duchess and said, &ldquo;Your highness mayconceive that never had knight-errant in this world a more talkative or adroller squire than I have, and he will prove the truth of what I say, ifyour highness is pleased to accept of my services for a few days.&rdquo;</p><p>To which the duchess made answer, &ldquo;that worthy Sancho is droll Iconsider a very good thing, because it is a sign that he is shrewd; fordrollery and sprightliness, Señor Don Quixote, as you very well know, donot take up their abode with dull wits; and as good Sancho is droll andsprightly I here set him down as shrewd.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And talkative,&rdquo; added Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;for many drollthings cannot be said in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come,great Knight of the Rueful Countenance&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of the Lions, your highness must say,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;forthere is no Rueful Countenance nor any such character now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He of the Lions be it,&rdquo; continued the duke; &ldquo;I say, letSir Knight of the Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shallbe given that reception which is due to so exalted a personage, and whichthe duchess and I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.&rdquo;</p><p>By this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante&rsquo;s saddle, andDon Quixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, theyplaced the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle. The duchessdesired Sancho to come to her side, for she found infinite enjoyment inlistening to his shrewd remarks. Sancho required no pressing, but pushedhimself in between them and the duke, who thought it rare good fortune toreceive such a knight-errant and such a homely squire in their castle.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p30e" id="p30e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p30e.jpg (54K)" src="images/p30e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch31b" id="ch31b"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.br/>WHICH TREATS OF MANY AND GREAT MATTERS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p31a" id="p31a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p31a.jpg (155K)" src="images/p31a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p31a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Supreme was the satisfaction that Sancho felt at seeing himself, as itseemed, an established favourite with the duchess, for he looked forwardto finding in her castle what he had found in Don Diego&rsquo;s house andin Basilio&rsquo;s; he was always fond of good living, and always seizedby the forelock any opportunity of feasting himself whenever it presenteditself. The history informs us, then, that before they reached the countryhouse or castle, the duke went on in advance and instructed all hisservants how they were to treat Don Quixote; and so the instant he came upto the castle gates with the duchess, two lackeys or equerries, clad inwhat they call morning gowns of fine crimson satin reaching to their feet,hastened out, and catching Don Quixote in their arms before he saw orheard them, said to him, &ldquo;Your highness should go and take my ladythe duchess off her horse.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p31b" id="p31b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p31b.jpg (334K)" src="images/p31b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p31b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote obeyed, and great bandying of compliments followed between thetwo over the matter; but in the end the duchess&rsquo;s determinationcarried the day, and she refused to get down or dismount from her palfreyexcept in the arms of the duke, saying she did not consider herself worthyto impose so unnecessary a burden on so great a knight. At length the dukecame out to take her down, and as they entered a spacious court two fairdamsels came forward and threw over Don Quixote&rsquo;s shoulders a largemantle of the finest scarlet cloth, and at the same instant all thegalleries of the court were lined with the men-servants and women-servantsof the household, crying, &ldquo;Welcome, flower and cream ofknight-errantry!&rdquo; while all or most of them flung pellets filledwith scented water over Don Quixote and the duke and duchess; at all whichDon Quixote was greatly astonished, and this was the first time that hethoroughly felt and believed himself to be a knight-errant in reality andnot merely in fancy, now that he saw himself treated in the same way as hehad read of such knights being treated in days of yore.</p><p>Sancho, deserting Dapple, hung on to the duchess and entered the castle,but feeling some twinges of conscience at having left the ass alone, heapproached a respectable duenna who had come out with the rest to receivethe duchess, and in a low voice he said to her, &ldquo;Señora Gonzalez, orhowever your grace may be called&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am called Doña Rodriguez de Grijalba,&rdquo; replied the duenna;&ldquo;what is your will, brother?&rdquo; To which Sancho made answer,&ldquo;I should be glad if your worship would do me the favour to go outto the castle gate, where you will find a grey ass of mine; make them, ifyou please, put him in the stable, or put him there yourself, for the poorlittle beast is rather easily frightened, and cannot bear being alone atall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If the master is as wise as the man,&rdquo; said the duenna,&ldquo;we have got a fine bargain. Be off with you, brother, and bad luckto you and him who brought you here; go, look after your ass, for we, theduennas of this house, are not used to work of that sort.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, in troth,&rdquo; returned Sancho, &ldquo;I have heard mymaster, who is the very treasure-finder of stories, telling the story ofLancelot when he came from Britain, say that ladies waited upon him andduennas upon his hack; and, if it comes to my ass, I wouldn&rsquo;t changehim for Señor Lancelot&rsquo;s hack.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you are a jester, brother,&rdquo; said the duenna, &ldquo;keepyour drolleries for some place where they&rsquo;ll pass muster and be paidfor; for you&rsquo;ll get nothing from me but a fig.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At any rate, it will be a very ripe one,&rdquo; said Sancho,&ldquo;for you won&rsquo;t lose the trick in years by a point too little.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Son of a bitch,&rdquo; said the duenna, all aglow with anger,&ldquo;whether I&rsquo;m old or not, it&rsquo;s with God I have to reckon,not with you, you garlic-stuffed scoundrel!&rdquo; and she said it soloud, that the duchess heard it, and turning round and seeing the duennain such a state of excitement, and her eyes flaming so, asked whom she waswrangling with.</p><p>&ldquo;With this good fellow here,&rdquo; said the duenna, &ldquo;who hasparticularly requested me to go and put an ass of his that is at thecastle gate into the stable, holding it up to me as an example that theydid the same I don&rsquo;t know where&mdash;that some ladies waited on oneLancelot, and duennas on his hack; and what is more, to wind up with, hecalled me old.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;I should have considered thegreatest affront that could be offered me;&rdquo; and addressing Sancho,she said to him, &ldquo;You must know, friend Sancho, that Doña Rodriguezis very youthful, and that she wears that hood more for authority andcustom&rsquo;s sake than because of her years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May all the rest of mine be unlucky,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;ifI meant it that way; I only spoke because the affection I have for my assis so great, and I thought I could not commend him to a more kind-heartedperson than the lady Doña Rodriguez.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote, who was listening, said to him, &ldquo;Is this properconversation for the place, Sancho?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;every one must mention what hewants wherever he may be; I thought of Dapple here, and I spoke of himhere; if I had thought of him in the stable I would have spoken there.&rdquo;</p><p>On which the duke observed, &ldquo;Sancho is quite right, and there is noreason at all to find fault with him; Dapple shall be fed to his heart&rsquo;scontent, and Sancho may rest easy, for he shall be treated like himself.&rdquo;</p><p>While this conversation, amusing to all except Don Quixote, wasproceeding, they ascended the staircase and ushered Don Quixote into achamber hung with rich cloth of gold and brocade; six damsels relieved himof his armour and waited on him like pages, all of them prepared andinstructed by the duke and duchess as to what they were to do, and howthey were to treat Don Quixote, so that he might see and believe they weretreating him like a knight-errant. When his armour was removed, therestood Don Quixote in his tight-fitting breeches and chamois doublet, lean,lanky, and long, with cheeks that seemed to be kissing each other inside;such a figure, that if the damsels waiting on him had not taken care tocheck their merriment (which was one of the particular directions theirmaster and mistress had given them), they would have burst with laughter.They asked him to let himself be stripped that they might put a shirt onhim, but he would not on any account, saying that modesty becameknights-errant just as much as valour. However, he said they might givethe shirt to Sancho; and shutting himself in with him in a room wherethere was a sumptuous bed, he undressed and put on the shirt; and then,finding himself alone with Sancho, he said to him, &ldquo;Tell me, thounew-fledged buffoon and old booby, dost thou think it right to offend andinsult a duenna so deserving of reverence and respect as that one justnow? Was that a time to bethink thee of thy Dapple, or are these noblepersonages likely to let the beasts fare badly when they treat theirowners in such elegant style? For God&rsquo;s sake, Sancho, restrainthyself, and don&rsquo;t show the thread so as to let them see what acoarse, boorish texture thou art of. Remember, sinner that thou art, themaster is the more esteemed the more respectable and well-bred hisservants are; and that one of the greatest advantages that princes haveover other men is that they have servants as good as themselves to wait onthem. Dost thou not see&mdash;shortsighted being that thou art, andunlucky mortal that I am!&mdash;that if they perceive thee to be a coarseclown or a dull blockhead, they will suspect me to be some impostor orswindler? Nay, nay, Sancho friend, keep clear, oh, keep clear of thesestumbling-blocks; for he who falls into the way of being a chatterbox anddroll, drops into a wretched buffoon the first time he trips; bridle thytongue, consider and weigh thy words before they escape thy mouth, andbear in mind we are now in quarters whence, by God&rsquo;s help, and thestrength of my arm, we shall come forth mightily advanced in fame andfortune.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho promised him with much earnestness to keep his mouth shut, and tobite off his tongue before he uttered a word that was not altogether tothe purpose and well considered, and told him he might make his mind easyon that point, for it should never be discovered through him what theywere.</p><p>Don Quixote dressed himself, put on his baldric with his sword, threw thescarlet mantle over his shoulders, placed on his head a montera of greensatin that the damsels had given him, and thus arrayed passed out into thelarge room, where he found the damsels drawn up in double file, the samenumber on each side, all with the appliances for washing the hands, whichthey presented to him with profuse obeisances and ceremonies. Then cametwelve pages, together with the seneschal, to lead him to dinner, as hishosts were already waiting for him. They placed him in the midst of them,and with much pomp and stateliness they conducted him into another room,where there was a sumptuous table laid with but four covers. The duchessand the duke came out to the door of the room to receive him, and withthem a grave ecclesiastic, one of those who rule noblemen&rsquo;s houses;one of those who, not being born magnates themselves, never know how toteach those who are how to behave as such; one of those who would have thegreatness of great folk measured by their own narrowness of mind; one ofthose who, when they try to introduce economy into the household theyrule, lead it into meanness. One of this sort, I say, must have been thegrave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive DonQuixote.</p><p>A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking DonQuixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The dukepressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he refused,the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept it.</p><p>The ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and duchessthose at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with amazementat the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons; andobserving all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the dukeand Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at the head of the table,he said, &ldquo;If your worship will give me leave I will tell you a storyof what happened in my village about this matter of seats.&rdquo;</p><p>The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he wasabout to say something foolish. Sancho glanced at him, and guessing histhoughts, said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of my going astray, señor, orsaying anything that won&rsquo;t be pat to the purpose; I haven&rsquo;tforgotten the advice your worship gave me just now about talking much orlittle, well or ill.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have no recollection of anything, Sancho,&rdquo; said DonQuixote; &ldquo;say what thou wilt, only say it quickly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;what I am going to say is sotrue that my master Don Quixote, who is here present, will keep me fromlying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lie as much as thou wilt for all I care, Sancho,&rdquo; said DonQuixote, &ldquo;for I am not going to stop thee, but consider what thouart going to say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have so considered and reconsidered,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;thatthe bell-ringer&rsquo;s in a safe berth; as will be seen by what follows.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It would be well,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;if yourhighnesses would order them to turn out this idiot, for he will talk aheap of nonsense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By the life of the duke, Sancho shall not be taken away from me fora moment,&rdquo; said the duchess; &ldquo;I am very fond of him, for Iknow he is very discreet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Discreet be the days of your holiness,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;forthe good opinion you have of my wit, though there&rsquo;s none in me; butthe story I want to tell is this. There was an invitation given by agentleman of my town, a very rich one, and one of quality, for he was oneof the Alamos of Medina del Campo, and married to Doña Mencia de Quiñones,the daughter of Don Alonso de Marañon, Knight of the Order of Santiago,that was drowned at the Herradura&mdash;him there was that quarrel aboutyears ago in our village, that my master Don Quixote was mixed up in, tothe best of my belief, that Tomasillo the scapegrace, the son of Balbastrothe smith, was wounded in.&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t all this true, master mine?As you live, say so, that these gentlefolk may not take me for some lyingchatterer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So far,&rdquo; said the ecclesiastic, &ldquo;I take you to be morea chatterer than a liar; but I don&rsquo;t know what I shall take you forby-and-by.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou citest so many witnesses and proofs, Sancho,&rdquo; said DonQuixote, &ldquo;that I have no choice but to say thou must be telling thetruth; go on, and cut the story short, for thou art taking the way not tomake an end for two days to come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is not to cut it short,&rdquo; said the duchess; &ldquo;on thecontrary, for my gratification, he is to tell it as he knows it, though heshould not finish it these six days; and if he took so many they would beto me the pleasantest I ever spent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, sirs, I say,&rdquo; continued Sancho, &ldquo;that thissame gentleman, whom I know as well as I do my own hands, for it&rsquo;snot a bowshot from my house to his, invited a poor but respectablelabourer&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get on, brother,&rdquo; said the churchman; &ldquo;at the rate youare going you will not stop with your story short of the next world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stop less than half-way, please God,&rdquo; said Sancho;&ldquo;and so I say this labourer, coming to the house of the gentleman Ispoke of that invited him&mdash;rest his soul, he is now dead; and more bytoken he died the death of an angel, so they say; for I was not there, forjust at that time I had gone to reap at Tembleque&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As you live, my son,&rdquo; said the churchman, &ldquo;make hasteback from Tembleque, and finish your story without burying the gentleman,unless you want to make more funerals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, it so happened,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that as thepair of them were going to sit down to table&mdash;and I think I can seethem now plainer than ever&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Great was the enjoyment the duke and duchess derived from the irritationthe worthy churchman showed at the long-winded, halting way Sancho had oftelling his story, while Don Quixote was chafing with rage and vexation.</p><p>&ldquo;So, as I was saying,&rdquo; continued Sancho, &ldquo;as the pair ofthem were going to sit down to table, as I said, the labourer insistedupon the gentleman&rsquo;s taking the head of the table, and the gentlemaninsisted upon the labourer&rsquo;s taking it, as his orders should beobeyed in his house; but the labourer, who plumed himself on hispoliteness and good breeding, would not on any account, until thegentleman, out of patience, putting his hands on his shoulders, compelledhim by force to sit down, saying, &lsquo;Sit down, you stupid lout, forwherever I sit will be the head to you; and that&rsquo;s the story, and,troth, I think it hasn&rsquo;t been brought in amiss here.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote turned all colours, which, on his sunburnt face, mottled ittill it looked like jasper. The duke and duchess suppressed their laughterso as not altogether to mortify Don Quixote, for they saw through Sancho&rsquo;simpertinence; and to change the conversation, and keep Sancho fromuttering more absurdities, the duchess asked Don Quixote what news he hadof the lady Dulcinea, and if he had sent her any presents of giants ormiscreants lately, for he could not but have vanquished a good many.</p><p>To which Don Quixote replied, &ldquo;Señora, my misfortunes, though theyhad a beginning, will never have an end. I have vanquished giants and Ihave sent her caitiffs and miscreants; but where are they to find her ifshe is enchanted and turned into the most ill-favoured peasant wench thatcan be imagined?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Sancho Panza; &ldquo;to me sheseems the fairest creature in the world; at any rate, in nimbleness andjumping she won&rsquo;t give in to a tumbler; by my faith, señora duchess,she leaps from the ground on to the back of an ass like a cat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you seen her enchanted, Sancho?&rdquo; asked the duke.</p><p>&ldquo;What, seen her!&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;why, who the devil wasit but myself that first thought of the enchantment business? She is asmuch enchanted as my father.&rdquo;</p><p>The ecclesiastic, when he heard them talking of giants and caitiffs andenchantments, began to suspect that this must be Don Quixote of La Mancha,whose story the duke was always reading; and he had himself often reprovedhim for it, telling him it was foolish to read such fooleries; andbecoming convinced that his suspicion was correct, addressing the duke, hesaid very angrily to him, &ldquo;Señor, your excellence will have to giveaccount to God for what this good man does. This Don Quixote, or DonSimpleton, or whatever his name is, cannot, I imagine, be such a blockheadas your excellence would have him, holding out encouragement to him to goon with his vagaries and follies.&rdquo; Then turning to address DonQuixote he said, &ldquo;And you, num-skull, who put it into your head thatyou are a knight-errant, and vanquish giants and capture miscreants? Goyour ways in a good hour, and in a good hour be it said to you. Go homeand bring up your children if you have any, and attend to your business,and give over going wandering about the world, gaping and making alaughing-stock of yourself to all who know you and all who don&rsquo;t.Where, in heaven&rsquo;s name, have you discovered that there are or everwere knights-errant? Where are there giants in Spain or miscreants in LaMancha, or enchanted Dulcineas, or all the rest of the silly things theytell about you?&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote listened attentively to the reverend gentleman&rsquo;s words,and as soon as he perceived he had done speaking, regardless of thepresence of the duke and duchess, he sprang to his feet with angry looksand an agitated countenance, and said&mdash;But the reply deserves achapter to itself.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p31e" id="p31e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p31e.jpg (46K)" src="images/p31e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch32b" id="ch32b"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.<br/>OF THE REPLY DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIS CENSURER, WITH OTHER INCIDENTS, GRAVEAND DROLL</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p32a" id="p32a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p32a.jpg (152K)" src="images/p32a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p32a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote, then, having risen to his feet, trembling from head to footlike a man dosed with mercury, said in a hurried, agitated voice, &ldquo;Theplace I am in, the presence in which I stand, and the respect I have andalways have had for the profession to which your worship belongs, hold andbind the hands of my just indignation; and as well for these reasons asbecause I know, as everyone knows, that a gownsman&rsquo;s weapon is thesame as a woman&rsquo;s, the tongue, I will with mine engage in equalcombat with your worship, from whom one might have expected good adviceinstead of foul abuse. Pious, well-meant reproof requires a differentdemeanour and arguments of another sort; at any rate, to have reproved mein public, and so roughly, exceeds the bounds of proper reproof, for thatcomes better with gentleness than with rudeness; and it is not seemly tocall the sinner roundly blockhead and booby, without knowing anything ofthe sin that is reproved. Come, tell me, for which of the stupidities youhave observed in me do you condemn and abuse me, and bid me go home andlook after my house and wife and children, without knowing whether I haveany? Is nothing more needed than to get a footing, by hook or by crook, inother people&rsquo;s houses to rule over the masters (and that, perhaps,after having been brought up in all the straitness of some seminary, andwithout having ever seen more of the world than may lie within twenty orthirty leagues round), to fit one to lay down the law rashly for chivalry,and pass judgment on knights-errant? Is it, haply, an idle occupation, oris the time ill-spent that is spent in roaming the world in quest, not ofits enjoyments, but of those arduous toils whereby the good mount upwardsto the abodes of everlasting life? If gentlemen, great lords, nobles, menof high birth, were to rate me as a fool I should take it as anirreparable insult; but I care not a farthing if clerks who have neverentered upon or trod the paths of chivalry should think me foolish. KnightI am, and knight I will die, if such be the pleasure of the Most High.Some take the broad road of overweening ambition; others that of mean andservile flattery; others that of deceitful hypocrisy, and some that oftrue religion; but I, led by my star, follow the narrow path ofknight-errantry, and in pursuit of that calling I despise wealth, but nothonour. I have redressed injuries, righted wrongs, punished insolences,vanquished giants, and crushed monsters; I am in love, for no other reasonthan that it is incumbent on knights-errant to be so; but though I am, Iam no carnal-minded lover, but one of the chaste, platonic sort. Myintentions are always directed to worthy ends, to do good to all and evilto none; and if he who means this, does this, and makes this his practicedeserves to be called a fool, it is for your highnesses to say, O mostexcellent duke and duchess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, by God!&rdquo; cried Sancho; &ldquo;say no more in your owndefence, master mine, for there&rsquo;s nothing more in the world to besaid, thought, or insisted on; and besides, when this gentleman denies, ashe has, that there are or ever have been any knights-errant in the world,is it any wonder if he knows nothing of what he has been talking about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps, brother,&rdquo; said the ecclesiastic, &ldquo;you are thatSancho Panza that is mentioned, to whom your master has promised anisland?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s more, I amone who deserves it as much as anyone; I am one of the sort&mdash;&lsquo;Attachthyself to the good, and thou wilt be one of them,&rsquo; and of those,&lsquo;Not with whom thou art bred, but with whom thou art fed,&rsquo; andof those, &lsquo;Who leans against a good tree, a good shade covers him;&rsquo;I have leant upon a good master, and I have been for months going aboutwith him, and please God I shall be just such another; long life to himand long life to me, for neither will he be in any want of empires torule, or I of islands to govern.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Sancho my friend, certainly not,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;forin the name of Señor Don Quixote I confer upon you the government of oneof no small importance that I have at my disposal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go down on thy knees, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;andkiss the feet of his excellence for the favour he has bestowed upon thee.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho obeyed, and on seeing this the ecclesiastic stood up from tablecompletely out of temper, exclaiming, &ldquo;By the gown I wear, I amalmost inclined to say that your excellence is as great a fool as thesesinners. No wonder they are mad, when people who are in their sensessanction their madness! I leave your excellence with them, for so long asthey are in the house, I will remain in my own, and spare myself thetrouble of reproving what I cannot remedy;&rdquo; and without utteringanother word, or eating another morsel, he went off, the entreaties of theduke and duchess being entirely unavailing to stop him; not that the dukesaid much to him, for he could not, because of the laughter hisuncalled-for anger provoked.</p><p>When he had done laughing, he said to Don Quixote, &ldquo;You have repliedon your own behalf so stoutly, Sir Knight of the Lions, that there is nooccasion to seek further satisfaction for this, which, though it may looklike an offence, is not so at all, for, as women can give no offence, nomore can ecclesiastics, as you very well know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and the reason is,that he who is not liable to offence cannot give offence to anyone. Women,children, and ecclesiastics, as they cannot defend themselves, though theymay receive offence cannot be insulted, because between the offence andthe insult there is, as your excellence very well knows, this difference:the insult comes from one who is capable of offering it, and does so, andmaintains it; the offence may come from any quarter without carryinginsult. To take an example: a man is standing unsuspectingly in the streetand ten others come up armed and beat him; he draws his sword and quitshimself like a man, but the number of his antagonists makes it impossiblefor him to effect his purpose and avenge himself; this man suffers anoffence but not an insult. Another example will make the same thing plain:a man is standing with his back turned, another comes up and strikes him,and after striking him takes to flight, without waiting an instant, andthe other pursues him but does not overtake him; he who received the blowreceived an offence, but not an insult, because an insult must bemaintained. If he who struck him, though he did so sneakingly andtreacherously, had drawn his sword and stood and faced him, then he whohad been struck would have received offence and insult at the same time;offence because he was struck treacherously, insult because he who struckhim maintained what he had done, standing his ground without taking toflight. And so, according to the laws of the accursed duel, I may havereceived offence, but not insult, for neither women nor children canmaintain it, nor can they wound, nor have they any way of standing theirground, and it is just the same with those connected with religion; forthese three sorts of persons are without arms offensive or defensive, andso, though naturally they are bound to defend themselves, they have noright to offend anybody; and though I said just now I might have receivedoffence, I say now certainly not, for he who cannot receive an insult canstill less give one; for which reasons I ought not to feel, nor do I feel,aggrieved at what that good man said to me; I only wish he had stayed alittle longer, that I might have shown him the mistake he makes insupposing and maintaining that there are not and never have been anyknights-errant in the world; had Amadis or any of his countlessdescendants heard him say as much, I am sure it would not have gone wellwith his worship.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will take my oath of that,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;they wouldhave given him a slash that would have slit him down from top to toe likea pomegranate or a ripe melon; they were likely fellows to put up withjokes of that sort! By my faith, I&rsquo;m certain if Reinaldos ofMontalvan had heard the little man&rsquo;s words he would have given himsuch a spank on the mouth that he wouldn&rsquo;t have spoken for the nextthree years; ay, let him tackle them, and he&rsquo;ll see how he&rsquo;llget out of their hands!&rdquo;</p><p>The duchess, as she listened to Sancho, was ready to die with laughter,and in her own mind she set him down as droller and madder than hismaster; and there were a good many just then who were of the same opinion.</p><p>Don Quixote finally grew calm, and dinner came to an end, and as the clothwas removed four damsels came in, one of them with a silver basin, anotherwith a jug also of silver, a third with two fine white towels on hershoulder, and the fourth with her arms bared to the elbows, and in herwhite hands (for white they certainly were) a round ball of Naples soap.The one with the basin approached, and with arch composure and impudence,thrust it under Don Quixote&rsquo;s chin, who, wondering at such aceremony, said never a word, supposing it to be the custom of that countryto wash beards instead of hands; he therefore stretched his out as far ashe could, and at the same instant the jug began to pour and the damselwith the soap rubbed his beard briskly, raising snow-flakes, for the soaplather was no less white, not only over the beard, but all over the face,and over the eyes of the submissive knight, so that they were perforceobliged to keep shut. The duke and duchess, who had not known anythingabout this, waited to see what came of this strange washing. The barberdamsel, when she had him a hand&rsquo;s breadth deep in lather, pretendedthat there was no more water, and bade the one with the jug go and fetchsome, while Señor Don Quixote waited. She did so, and Don Quixote was leftthe strangest and most ludicrous figure that could be imagined. All thosepresent, and there were a good many, were watching him, and as they sawhim there with half a yard of neck, and that uncommonly brown, his eyesshut, and his beard full of soap, it was a great wonder, and only by greatdiscretion, that they were able to restrain their laughter. The damsels,the concocters of the joke, kept their eyes down, not daring to look attheir master and mistress; and as for them, laughter and anger struggledwithin them, and they knew not what to do, whether to punish the audacityof the girls, or to reward them for the amusement they had received fromseeing Don Quixote in such a plight.</p><p>At length the damsel with the jug returned and they made an end of washingDon Quixote, and the one who carried the towels very deliberately wipedhim and dried him; and all four together making him a profound obeisanceand curtsey, they were about to go, when the duke, lest Don Quixote shouldsee through the joke, called out to the one with the basin saying, &ldquo;Comeand wash me, and take care that there is water enough.&rdquo; The girl,sharp-witted and prompt, came and placed the basin for the duke as she haddone for Don Quixote, and they soon had him well soaped and washed, andhaving wiped him dry they made their obeisance and retired. It appearedafterwards that the duke had sworn that if they had not washed him as theyhad Don Quixote he would have punished them for their impudence, whichthey adroitly atoned for by soaping him as well.</p><p>Sancho observed the ceremony of the washing very attentively, and said tohimself, &ldquo;God bless me, if it were only the custom in this countryto wash squires&rsquo; beards too as well as knights&rsquo;. For by Godand upon my soul I want it badly; and if they gave me a scrape of therazor besides I&rsquo;d take it as a still greater kindness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you saying to yourself, Sancho?&rdquo; asked the duchess.</p><p>&ldquo;I was saying, señora,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that in the courtsof other princes, when the cloth is taken away, I have always heard saythey give water for the hands, but not lye for the beard; and that showsit is good to live long that you may see much; to be sure, they say toothat he who lives a long life must undergo much evil, though to undergo awashing of that sort is pleasure rather than pain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be uneasy, friend Sancho,&rdquo; said the duchess;&ldquo;I will take care that my damsels wash you, and even put you in thetub if necessary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be content with the beard,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;atany rate for the present; and as for the future, God has decreed what isto be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Attend to worthy Sancho&rsquo;s request, seneschal,&rdquo; said theduchess, &ldquo;and do exactly what he wishes.&rdquo;</p><p>The seneschal replied that Señor Sancho should be obeyed in everything;and with that he went away to dinner and took Sancho along with him, whilethe duke and duchess and Don Quixote remained at table discussing a greatvariety of things, but all bearing on the calling of arms andknight-errantry.</p><p>The duchess begged Don Quixote, as he seemed to have a retentive memory,to describe and portray to her the beauty and features of the ladyDulcinea del Toboso, for, judging by what fame trumpeted abroad of herbeauty, she felt sure she must be the fairest creature in the world, nay,in all La Mancha.</p><p>Don Quixote sighed on hearing the duchess&rsquo;s request, and said,&ldquo;If I could pluck out my heart, and lay it on a plate on this tablehere before your highness&rsquo;s eyes, it would spare my tongue the painof telling what can hardly be thought of, for in it your excellence wouldsee her portrayed in full. But why should I attempt to depict and describein detail, and feature by feature, the beauty of the peerless Dulcinea,the burden being one worthy of other shoulders than mine, an enterprisewherein the pencils of Parrhasius, Timantes, and Apelles, and the graverof Lysippus ought to be employed, to paint it in pictures and carve it inmarble and bronze, and Ciceronian and Demosthenian eloquence to sound itspraises?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What does Demosthenian mean, Señor Don Quixote?&rdquo; said theduchess; &ldquo;it is a word I never heard in all my life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Demosthenian eloquence,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;means theeloquence of Demosthenes, as Ciceronian means that of Cicero, who were thetwo most eloquent orators in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the duke; &ldquo;you must have lost your wits toask such a question. Nevertheless, Señor Don Quixote would greatly gratifyus if he would depict her to us; for never fear, even in an outline orsketch she will be something to make the fairest envious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would do so certainly,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;had shenot been blurred to my mind&rsquo;s eye by the misfortune that fell uponher a short time since, one of such a nature that I am more ready to weepover it than to describe it. For your highnesses must know that, going afew days back to kiss her hands and receive her benediction, approbation,and permission for this third sally, I found her altogether a differentbeing from the one I sought; I found her enchanted and changed from aprincess into a peasant, from fair to foul, from an angel into a devil,from fragrant to pestiferous, from refined to clownish, from a dignifiedlady into a jumping tomboy, and, in a word, from Dulcinea del Toboso intoa coarse Sayago wench.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God bless me!&rdquo; said the duke aloud at this, &ldquo;who canhave done the world such an injury? Who can have robbed it of the beautythat gladdened it, of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modestythat shed a lustre upon it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; replied Don Quixote; &ldquo;who could it be but somemalignant enchanter of the many that persecute me out of envy&mdash;thataccursed race born into the world to obscure and bring to naught theachievements of the good, and glorify and exalt the deeds of the wicked?Enchanters have persecuted me, enchanters persecute me still, andenchanters will continue to persecute me until they have sunk me and mylofty chivalry in the deep abyss of oblivion; and they injure and wound mewhere they know I feel it most. For to deprive a knight-errant of his ladyis to deprive him of the eyes he sees with, of the sun that gives himlight, of the food whereby he lives. Many a time before have I said it,and I say it now once more, a knight-errant without a lady is like a treewithout leaves, a building without a foundation, or a shadow without thebody that causes it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no denying it,&rdquo; said the duchess; &ldquo;but still,if we are to believe the history of Don Quixote that has come out herelately with general applause, it is to be inferred from it, if I mistakenot, that you never saw the lady Dulcinea, and that the said lady isnothing in the world but an imaginary lady, one that you yourself begotand gave birth to in your brain, and adorned with whatever charms andperfections you chose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is a good deal to be said on that point,&rdquo; said DonQuixote; &ldquo;God knows whether there be any Dulcinea or not in theworld, or whether she is imaginary or not imaginary; these are things theproof of which must not be pushed to extreme lengths. I have not begottennor given birth to my lady, though I behold her as she needs must be, alady who contains in herself all the qualities to make her famousthroughout the world, beautiful without blemish, dignified withouthaughtiness, tender and yet modest, gracious from courtesy and courteousfrom good breeding, and lastly, of exalted lineage, because beauty shinesforth and excels with a higher degree of perfection upon good blood thanin the fair of lowly birth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the duke; &ldquo;but Señor Don Quixotewill give me leave to say what I am constrained to say by the story of hisexploits that I have read, from which it is to be inferred that, grantingthere is a Dulcinea in El Toboso, or out of it, and that she is in thehighest degree beautiful as you have described her to us, as regards theloftiness of her lineage she is not on a par with the Orianas,Alastrajareas, Madasimas, or others of that sort, with whom, as you wellknow, the histories abound.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To that I may reply,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that Dulcineais the daughter of her own works, and that virtues rectify blood, and thatlowly virtue is more to be regarded and esteemed than exalted vice.Dulcinea, besides, has that within her that may raise her to be a crownedand sceptred queen; for the merit of a fair and virtuous woman is capableof performing greater miracles; and virtually, though not formally, shehas in herself higher fortunes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I protest, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;thatin all you say, you go most cautiously and lead in hand, as the saying is;henceforth I will believe myself, and I will take care that everyone in myhouse believes, even my lord the duke if needs be, that there is aDulcinea in El Toboso, and that she is living to-day, and that she isbeautiful and nobly born and deserves to have such a knight as Señor DonQuixote in her service, and that is the highest praise that it is in mypower to give her or that I can think of. But I cannot help entertaining adoubt, and having a certain grudge against Sancho Panza; the doubt isthis, that the aforesaid history declares that the said Sancho Panza, whenhe carried a letter on your worship&rsquo;s behalf to the said ladyDulcinea, found her sifting a sack of wheat; and more by token it says itwas red wheat; a thing which makes me doubt the loftiness of her lineage.&rdquo;</p><p>To this Don Quixote made answer, &ldquo;Señora, your highness must knowthat everything or almost everything that happens me transcends theordinary limits of what happens to other knights-errant; whether it bethat it is directed by the inscrutable will of destiny, or by the maliceof some jealous enchanter. Now it is an established fact that all or mostfamous knights-errant have some special gift, one that of being proofagainst enchantment, another that of being made of such invulnerable fleshthat he cannot be wounded, as was the famous Roland, one of the twelvepeers of France, of whom it is related that he could not be wounded exceptin the sole of his left foot, and that it must be with the point of astout pin and not with any other sort of weapon whatever; and so, whenBernardo del Carpio slew him at Roncesvalles, finding that he could notwound him with steel, he lifted him up from the ground in his arms andstrangled him, calling to mind seasonably the death which Herculesinflicted on Antæus, the fierce giant that they say was the son of Terra.I would infer from what I have mentioned that perhaps I may have some giftof this kind, not that of being invulnerable, because experience has manytimes proved to me that I am of tender flesh and not at all impenetrable;nor that of being proof against enchantment, for I have already seenmyself thrust into a cage, in which all the world would not have been ableto confine me except by force of enchantments. But as I delivered myselffrom that one, I am inclined to believe that there is no other that canhurt me; and so, these enchanters, seeing that they cannot exert theirvile craft against my person, revenge themselves on what I love most, andseek to rob me of life by maltreating that of Dulcinea in whom I live; andtherefore I am convinced that when my squire carried my message to her,they changed her into a common peasant girl, engaged in such a meanoccupation as sifting wheat; I have already said, however, that that wheatwas not red wheat, nor wheat at all, but grains of orient pearl. And as aproof of all this, I must tell your highnesses that, coming to El Toboso ashort time back, I was altogether unable to discover the palace ofDulcinea; and that the next day, though Sancho, my squire, saw her in herown proper shape, which is the fairest in the world, to me she appeared tobe a coarse, ill-favoured farm-wench, and by no means a well-spoken one,she who is propriety itself. And so, as I am not and, so far as one canjudge, cannot be enchanted, she it is that is enchanted, that is smitten,that is altered, changed, and transformed; in her have my enemies revengedthemselves upon me, and for her shall I live in ceaseless tears, until Isee her in her pristine state. I have mentioned this lest anybody shouldmind what Sancho said about Dulcinea&rsquo;s winnowing or sifting; for, asthey changed her to me, it is no wonder if they changed her to him.Dulcinea is illustrious and well-born, and of one of the gentle familiesof El Toboso, which are many, ancient, and good. Therein, most assuredly,not small is the share of the peerless Dulcinea, through whom her townwill be famous and celebrated in ages to come, as Troy was through Helen,and Spain through La Cava, though with a better title and tradition. Foranother thing; I would have your graces understand that Sancho Panza isone of the drollest squires that ever served knight-errant; sometimesthere is a simplicity about him so acute that it is an amusement to tryand make out whether he is simple or sharp; he has mischievous tricks thatstamp him rogue, and blundering ways that prove him a booby; he doubtseverything and believes everything; when I fancy he is on the point ofcoming down headlong from sheer stupidity, he comes out with somethingshrewd that sends him up to the skies. After all, I would not exchange himfor another squire, though I were given a city to boot, and therefore I amin doubt whether it will be well to send him to the government yourhighness has bestowed upon him; though I perceive in him a certainaptitude for the work of governing, so that, with a little trimming of hisunderstanding, he would manage any government as easily as the king doeshis taxes; and moreover, we know already ample experience that it does notrequire much cleverness or much learning to be a governor, for there are ahundred round about us that scarcely know how to read, and govern likegerfalcons. The main point is that they should have good intentions and bedesirous of doing right in all things, for they will never be at a lossfor persons to advise and direct them in what they have to do, like thoseknight-governors who, being no lawyers, pronounce sentences with the aidof an assessor. My advice to him will be to take no bribe and surrender noright, and I have some other little matters in reserve, that shall beproduced in due season for Sancho&rsquo;s benefit and the advantage of theisland he is to govern.&rdquo;</p><p>The duke, duchess, and Don Quixote had reached this point in theirconversation, when they heard voices and a great hubbub in the palace, andSancho burst abruptly into the room all glowing with anger, with astraining-cloth by way of a bib, and followed by several servants, or,more properly speaking, kitchen-boys and other underlings, one of whomcarried a small trough full of water, that from its colour and impuritywas plainly dishwater. The one with the trough pursued him and followedhim everywhere he went, endeavouring with the utmost persistence to thrustit under his chin, while another kitchen-boy seemed anxious to wash hisbeard.</p><p>&ldquo;What is all this, brothers?&rdquo; asked the duchess. &ldquo;Whatis it? What do you want to do to this good man? Do you forget he is agovernor-elect?&rdquo;</p><p>To which the barber kitchen-boy replied, &ldquo;The gentleman will not lethimself be washed as is customary, and as my lord and the señor his masterhave been.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; said Sancho, in a great rage; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;dlike it to be with cleaner towels, clearer lye, and not such dirty hands;for there&rsquo;s not so much difference between me and my master that heshould be washed with angels&rsquo; water and I with devil&rsquo;s lye.The customs of countries and princes&rsquo; palaces are only good so longas they give no annoyance; but the way of washing they have here is worsethan doing penance. I have a clean beard, and I don&rsquo;t require to berefreshed in that fashion, and whoever comes to wash me or touch a hair ofmy head, I mean to say my beard, with all due respect be it said, I&rsquo;llgive him a punch that will leave my fist sunk in his skull; for cirimoniesand soapings of this sort are more like jokes than the polite attentionsof one&rsquo;s host.&rdquo;</p><p>The duchess was ready to die with laughter when she saw Sancho&rsquo;srage and heard his words; but it was no pleasure to Don Quixote to see himin such a sorry trim, with the dingy towel about him, and the hangers-onof the kitchen all round him; so making a low bow to the duke and duchess,as if to ask their permission to speak, he addressed the rout in adignified tone: &ldquo;Holloa, gentlemen! you let that youth alone, and goback to where you came from, or anywhere else if you like; my squire is asclean as any other person, and those troughs are as bad as narrowthin-necked jars to him; take my advice and leave him alone, for neitherhe nor I understand joking.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho took the word out of his mouth and went on, &ldquo;Nay, let themcome and try their jokes on the country bumpkin, for it&rsquo;s about aslikely I&rsquo;ll stand them as that it&rsquo;s now midnight! Let thembring me a comb here, or what they please, and curry this beard of mine,and if they get anything out of it that offends against cleanliness, letthem clip me to the skin.&rdquo;</p><p>Upon this, the duchess, laughing all the while, said, &ldquo;Sancho Panzais right, and always will be in all he says; he is clean, and, as he sayshimself, he does not require to be washed; and if our ways do not pleasehim, he is free to choose. Besides, you promoters of cleanliness have beenexcessively careless and thoughtless, I don&rsquo;t know if I ought not tosay audacious, to bring troughs and wooden utensils and kitchendishclouts, instead of basins and jugs of pure gold and towels of holland,to such a person and such a beard; but, after all, you are ill-conditionedand ill-bred, and spiteful as you are, you cannot help showing the grudgeyou have against the squires of knights-errant.&rdquo;</p><p>The impudent servitors, and even the seneschal who came with them, tookthe duchess to be speaking in earnest, so they removed the straining-clothfrom Sancho&rsquo;s neck, and with something like shame and confusion offace went off all of them and left him; whereupon he, seeing himself safeout of that extreme danger, as it seemed to him, ran and fell on his kneesbefore the duchess, saying, &ldquo;From great ladies great favours may belooked for; this which your grace has done me to-day cannot be requitedwith less than wishing I was dubbed a knight-errant, to devote myself allthe days of my life to the service of so exalted a lady. I am a labouringman, my name is Sancho Panza, I am married, I have children, and I amserving as a squire; if in any one of these ways I can serve yourhighness, I will not be longer in obeying than your grace in commanding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is easy to see, Sancho,&rdquo; replied the duchess, &ldquo;thatyou have learned to be polite in the school of politeness itself; I meanto say it is easy to see that you have been nursed in the bosom of SeñorDon Quixote, who is, of course, the cream of good breeding and flower ofceremony&mdash;or cirimony, as you would say yourself. Fair be thefortunes of such a master and such a servant, the one the cynosure ofknight-errantry, the other the star of squirely fidelity! Rise, Sancho, myfriend; I will repay your courtesy by taking care that my lord the dukemakes good to you the promised gift of the government as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>With this, the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote retired totake his midday sleep; but the duchess begged Sancho, unless he had a verygreat desire to go to sleep, to come and spend the afternoon with her andher damsels in a very cool chamber. Sancho replied that, though hecertainly had the habit of sleeping four or five hours in the heat of theday in summer, to serve her excellence he would try with all his might notto sleep even one that day, and that he would come in obedience to hercommand, and with that he went off. The duke gave fresh orders withrespect to treating Don Quixote as a knight-errant, without departing evenin smallest particular from the style in which, as the stories tell us,they used to treat the knights of old.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p32e" id="p32e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p32e.jpg (16K)" src="images/p32e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch33b" id="ch33b"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII.<br/>OF THE DELECTABLE DISCOURSE WHICH THE DUCHESS AND HER DAMSELS HELD WITHSANCHO PANZA, WELL WORTH READING AND NOTING</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p33a" id="p33a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p33a.jpg (138K)" src="images/p33a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p33a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The history records that Sancho did not sleep that afternoon, but in orderto keep his word came, before he had well done dinner, to visit theduchess, who, finding enjoyment in listening to him, made him sit downbeside her on a low seat, though Sancho, out of pure good breeding, wantednot to sit down; the duchess, however, told him he was to sit down asgovernor and talk as squire, as in both respects he was worthy of even thechair of the Cid Ruy Diaz the Campeador. Sancho shrugged his shoulders,obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess&rsquo;s damsels and duennasgathered round him, waiting in profound silence to hear what he would say.It was the duchess, however, who spoke first, saying:</p><p>&ldquo;Now that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhearus, I should be glad if the señor governor would relieve me of certaindoubts I have, rising out of the history of the great Don Quixote that isnow in print. One is: inasmuch as worthy Sancho never saw Dulcinea, I meanthe lady Dulcinea del Toboso, nor took Don Quixote&rsquo;s letter to her,for it was left in the memorandum book in the Sierra Morena, how did hedare to invent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat,the whole story being a deception and falsehood, and so much to theprejudice of the peerless Dulcinea&rsquo;s good name, a thing that is notat all becoming the character and fidelity of a good squire?&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p33b" id="p33b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p33b.jpg (326K)" src="images/p33b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p33b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>At these words, Sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up from hischair, and with noiseless steps, with his body bent and his finger on hislips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings; and this done, hecame back to his seat and said, &ldquo;Now, señora, that I have seen thatthere is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly, I willanswer what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without fear ordread. And the first thing I have got to say is, that for my own part Ihold my master Don Quixote to be stark mad, though sometimes he saysthings that, to my mind, and indeed everybody&rsquo;s that listens to him,are so wise, and run in such a straight furrow, that Satan himself couldnot have said them better; but for all that, really, and beyond allquestion, it&rsquo;s my firm belief he is cracked. Well, then, as this isclear to my mind, I can venture to make him believe things that haveneither head nor tail, like that affair of the answer to the letter, andthat other of six or eight days ago, which is not yet in history, that isto say, the affair of the enchantment of my lady Dulcinea; for I made himbelieve she is enchanted, though there&rsquo;s no more truth in it thanover the hills of Úbeda.&rdquo;</p><p>The duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or deception, soSancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened, and his hearerswere not a little amused by it; and then resuming, the duchess said,&ldquo;In consequence of what worthy Sancho has told me, a doubt starts upin my mind, and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says, &lsquo;IfDon Quixote be mad, crazy, and cracked, and Sancho Panza his squire knowsit, and, notwithstanding, serves and follows him, and goes trusting to hisempty promises, there can be no doubt he must be still madder and sillierthan his master; and that being so, it will be cast in your teeth, señoraduchess, if you give the said Sancho an island to govern; for how will hewho does not know how to govern himself know how to govern others?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God, señora,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but that doubt comestimely; but your grace may say it out, and speak plainly, or as you like;for I know what you say is true, and if I were wise I should have left mymaster long ago; but this was my fate, this was my bad luck; I can&rsquo;thelp it, I must follow him; we&rsquo;re from the same village, I&rsquo;veeaten his bread, I&rsquo;m fond of him, I&rsquo;m grateful, he gave me hisass-colts, and above all I&rsquo;m faithful; so it&rsquo;s quiteimpossible for anything to separate us, except the pickaxe and shovel. Andif your highness does not like to give me the government you promised, Godmade me without it, and maybe your not giving it to me will be all thebetter for my conscience, for fool as I am I know the proverb &lsquo;toher hurt the ant got wings,&rsquo; and it may be that Sancho the squirewill get to heaven sooner than Sancho the governor. &lsquo;They make asgood bread here as in France,&rsquo; and &lsquo;by night all cats aregrey,&rsquo; and &lsquo;a hard case enough his, who hasn&rsquo;t brokenhis fast at two in the afternoon,&rsquo; and &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nostomach a hand&rsquo;s breadth bigger than another,&rsquo; and the samecan be filled &lsquo;with straw or hay,&rsquo; as the saying is, and&lsquo;the little birds of the field have God for their purveyor andcaterer,&rsquo; and &lsquo;four yards of Cuenca frieze keep one warmerthan four of Segovia broad-cloth,&rsquo; and &lsquo;when we quit thisworld and are put underground the prince travels by as narrow a path asthe journeyman,&rsquo; and &lsquo;the Pope&rsquo;s body does not take upmore feet of earth than the sacristan&rsquo;s,&rsquo; for all that the oneis higher than the other; for when we go to our graves we all packourselves up and make ourselves small, or rather they pack us up and makeus small in spite of us, and then&mdash;good night to us. And I say oncemore, if your ladyship does not like to give me the island because I&rsquo;ma fool, like a wise man I will take care to give myself no trouble aboutit; I have heard say that &lsquo;behind the cross there&rsquo;s the devil,&rsquo;and that &lsquo;all that glitters is not gold,&rsquo; and that from amongthe oxen, and the ploughs, and the yokes, Wamba the husbandman was takento be made King of Spain, and from among brocades, and pleasures, andriches, Roderick was taken to be devoured by adders, if the verses of theold ballads don&rsquo;t lie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To be sure they don&rsquo;t lie!&rdquo; exclaimed Doña Rodriguez,the duenna, who was one of the listeners. &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s aballad that says they put King Rodrigo alive into a tomb full of toads,and adders, and lizards, and that two days afterwards the king, in aplaintive, feeble voice, cried out from within the tomb-</p><p class="poem">They gnaw me now, they gnaw me now,<br/>There where I most did sin.</p><p class="noindent">And according to that the gentleman has good reason to say he would ratherbe a labouring man than a king, if vermin are to eat him.&rdquo;</p><p>The duchess could not help laughing at the simplicity of her duenna, orwondering at the language and proverbs of Sancho, to whom she said,&ldquo;Worthy Sancho knows very well that when once a knight has made apromise he strives to keep it, though it should cost him his life. My lordand husband the duke, though not one of the errant sort, is none the lessa knight for that reason, and will keep his word about the promisedisland, in spite of the envy and malice of the world. Let Sancho be ofgood cheer; for when he least expects it he will find himself seated onthe throne of his island and seat of dignity, and will take possession ofhis government that he may discard it for another of three-borderedbrocade. The charge I give him is to be careful how he governs hisvassals, bearing in mind that they are all loyal and well-born.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As to governing them well,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;there&rsquo;sno need of charging me to do that, for I&rsquo;m kind-hearted by nature,and full of compassion for the poor; there&rsquo;s no stealing the loaffrom him who kneads and bakes;&rsquo; and by my faith it won&rsquo;t do tothrow false dice with me; I am an old dog, and I know all about &lsquo;tus,tus;&rsquo; I can be wide-awake if need be, and I don&rsquo;t let cloudscome before my eyes, for I know where the shoe pinches me; I say so,because with me the good will have support and protection, and the badneither footing nor access. And it seems to me that, in governments, tomake a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having been governor afortnight, I&rsquo;ll take kindly to the work and know more about it thanthe field labour I have been brought up to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are right, Sancho,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;for no oneis born ready taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out ofstones. But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, theenchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and somethingmore than evident, that Sancho&rsquo;s idea of practising a deception uponhis master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and thatif he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was alla device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truthand earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench whojumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthySancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that isdeceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this,than of anything else we never saw. Señor Sancho Panza must know that wetoo have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us whatgoes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge ordeception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile country lass was and isDulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore her;and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper form, andthen Sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at present.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that&rsquo;s very possible,&rdquo; said Sancho Panza; &ldquo;andnow I&rsquo;m willing to believe what my master says about what he saw inthe cave of Montesinos, where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Tobosoin the very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when Ienchanted her all to please myself. It must be all exactly the other way,as your ladyship says; because it is impossible to suppose that out of mypoor wit such a cunning trick could be concocted in a moment, nor do Ithink my master is so mad that by my weak and feeble persuasion he couldbe made to believe a thing so out of all reason. But, señora, yourexcellence must not therefore think me ill-disposed, for a dolt like me isnot bound to see into the thoughts and plots of those vile enchanters. Iinvented all that to escape my master&rsquo;s scolding, and not with anyintention of hurting him; and if it has turned out differently, there is aGod in heaven who judges our hearts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the duchess; &ldquo;but tell me, Sancho,what is this you say about the cave of Montesinos, for I should like toknow.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho upon this related to her, word for word, what has been said alreadytouching that adventure, and having heard it the duchess said, &ldquo;Fromthis occurrence it may be inferred that, as the great Don Quixote says hesaw there the same country wench Sancho saw on the way from El Toboso, itis, no doubt, Dulcinea, and that there are some very active andexceedingly busy enchanters about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I say,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and if my lady Dulcinea isenchanted, so much the worse for her, and I&rsquo;m not going to pick aquarrel with my master&rsquo;s enemies, who seem to be many and spiteful.The truth is that the one I saw was a country wench, and I set her down tobe a country wench; and if that was Dulcinea it must not be laid at mydoor, nor should I be called to answer for it or take the consequences.But they must go nagging at me at every step&mdash;&lsquo;Sancho said it,Sancho did it, Sancho here, Sancho there,&rsquo; as if Sancho was nobodyat all, and not that same Sancho Panza that&rsquo;s now going all over theworld in books, so Samson Carrasco told me, and he&rsquo;s at any rate onethat&rsquo;s a bachelor of Salamanca; and people of that sort can&rsquo;tlie, except when the whim seizes them or they have some very good reasonfor it. So there&rsquo;s no occasion for anybody to quarrel with me; andthen I have a good character, and, as I have heard my master say, &lsquo;agood name is better than great riches;&rsquo; let them only stick me intothis government and they&rsquo;ll see wonders, for one who has been a goodsquire will be a good governor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All worthy Sancho&rsquo;s observations,&rdquo; said the duchess,&ldquo;are Catonian sentences, or at any rate out of the very heart ofMichael Verino himself, who <i>florentibus occidit annis</i>. In fact, to speakin his own style, &lsquo;under a bad cloak there&rsquo;s often a gooddrinker.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed, señora,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;I never yet drank out ofwickedness; from thirst I have very likely, for I have nothing of thehypocrite in me; I drink when I&rsquo;m inclined, or, if I&rsquo;m notinclined, when they offer it to me, so as not to look either strait-lacedor ill-bred; for when a friend drinks one&rsquo;s health what heart can beso hard as not to return it? But if I put on my shoes I don&rsquo;t dirtythem; besides, squires to knights-errant mostly drink water, for they arealways wandering among woods, forests and meadows, mountains and crags,without a drop of wine to be had if they gave their eyes for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I believe,&rdquo; said the duchess; &ldquo;and now let Sancho goand take his sleep, and we will talk by-and-by at greater length, andsettle how he may soon go and stick himself into the government, as hesays.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho once more kissed the duchess&rsquo;s hand, and entreated her to letgood care be taken of his Dapple, for he was the light of his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;What is Dapple?&rdquo; said the duchess.</p><p>&ldquo;My ass,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;which, not to mention him bythat name, I&rsquo;m accustomed to call Dapple; I begged this lady duennahere to take care of him when I came into the castle, and she got as angryas if I had said she was ugly or old, though it ought to be more naturaland proper for duennas to feed asses than to ornament chambers. God blessme! what a spite a gentleman of my village had against these ladies!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He must have been some clown,&rdquo; said Doña Rodriguez theduenna; &ldquo;for if he had been a gentleman and well-born he would haveexalted them higher than the horns of the moon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said the duchess; &ldquo;no more of this;hush, Doña Rodriguez, and let Señor Panza rest easy and leave thetreatment of Dapple in my charge, for as he is a treasure of Sancho&rsquo;s,I&rsquo;ll put him on the apple of my eye.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will be enough for him to be in the stable,&rdquo; said Sancho,&ldquo;for neither he nor I are worthy to rest a moment in the apple ofyour highness&rsquo;s eye, and I&rsquo;d as soon stab myself as consent toit; for though my master says that in civilities it is better to lose by acard too many than a card too few, when it comes to civilities to asses wemust mind what we are about and keep within due bounds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take him to your government, Sancho,&rdquo; said the duchess,&ldquo;and there you will be able to make as much of him as you like, andeven release him from work and pension him off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think, señora duchess, that you have said anythingabsurd,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I have seen more than two asses go togovernments, and for me to take mine with me would be nothing new.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho&rsquo;s words made the duchess laugh again and gave her freshamusement, and dismissing him to sleep she went away to tell the duke theconversation she had had with him, and between them they plotted andarranged to play a joke upon Don Quixote that was to be a rare one andentirely in knight-errantry style, and in that same style they practisedseveral upon him, so much in keeping and so clever that they form the bestadventures this great history contains.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p33e" id="p33e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p33e.jpg (34K)" src="images/p33e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch34b" id="ch34b"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br/>WHICH RELATES HOW THEY LEARNED THE WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE TO DISENCHANTTHE PEERLESS DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO, WHICH IS ONE OF THE RAREST ADVENTURES INTHIS BOOK</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p34a" id="p34a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p34a.jpg (141K)" src="images/p34a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p34a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Great was the pleasure the duke and duchess took in the conversation ofDon Quixote and Sancho Panza; and, more bent than ever upon the plan theyhad of practising some jokes upon them that should have the look andappearance of adventures, they took as their basis of action what DonQuixote had already told them about the cave of Montesinos, in order toplay him a famous one. But what the duchess marvelled at above all wasthat Sancho&rsquo;s simplicity could be so great as to make him believe asabsolute truth that Dulcinea had been enchanted, when it was he himselfwho had been the enchanter and trickster in the business. Having,therefore, instructed their servants in everything they were to do, sixdays afterwards they took him out to hunt, with as great a retinue ofhuntsmen and beaters as a crowned king.</p><p>They presented Don Quixote with a hunting suit, and Sancho with another ofthe finest green cloth; but Don Quixote declined to put his on, sayingthat he must soon return to the hard pursuit of arms, and could not carrywardrobes or stores with him. Sancho, however, took what they gave him,meaning to sell it at the first opportunity.</p><p>The appointed day having arrived, Don Quixote armed himself, and Sanchoarrayed himself, and mounted on his Dapple (for he would not give him upthough they offered him a horse), he placed himself in the midst of thetroop of huntsmen. The duchess came out splendidly attired, and DonQuixote, in pure courtesy and politeness, held the rein of her palfrey,though the duke wanted not to allow him; and at last they reached a woodthat lay between two high mountains, where, after occupying various posts,ambushes, and paths, and distributing the party in different positions,the hunt began with great noise, shouting, and hallooing, so that, betweenthe baying of the hounds and the blowing of the horns, they could not hearone another. The duchess dismounted, and with a sharp boar-spear in herhand posted herself where she knew the wild boars were in the habit ofpassing. The duke and Don Quixote likewise dismounted and placedthemselves one at each side of her. Sancho took up a position in the rearof all without dismounting from Dapple, whom he dared not desert lest somemischief should befall him. Scarcely had they taken their stand in a linewith several of their servants, when they saw a huge boar, closely pressedby the hounds and followed by the huntsmen, making towards them, grindinghis teeth and tusks, and scattering foam from his mouth. As soon as he sawhim Don Quixote, bracing his shield on his arm, and drawing his sword,advanced to meet him; the duke with boar-spear did the same; but theduchess would have gone in front of them all had not the duke preventedher. Sancho alone, deserting Dapple at the sight of the mighty beast, tookto his heels as hard as he could and strove in vain to mount a tall oak.As he was clinging to a branch, however, half-way up in his struggle toreach the top, the bough, such was his ill-luck and hard fate, gave way,and caught in his fall by a broken limb of the oak, he hung suspended inthe air unable to reach the ground. Finding himself in this position, andthat the green coat was beginning to tear, and reflecting that if thefierce animal came that way he might be able to get at him, he began toutter such cries, and call for help so earnestly, that all who heard himand did not see him felt sure he must be in the teeth of some wild beast.In the end the tusked boar fell pierced by the blades of the many spearsthey held in front of him; and Don Quixote, turning round at the cries ofSancho, for he knew by them that it was he, saw him hanging from the oakhead downwards, with Dapple, who did not forsake him in his distress,close beside him; and Cide Hamete observes that he seldom saw Sancho Panzawithout seeing Dapple, or Dapple without seeing Sancho Panza; such wastheir attachment and loyalty one to the other. Don Quixote went over andunhooked Sancho, who, as soon as he found himself on the ground, looked atthe rent in his huntingcoat and was grieved to the heart, for he thoughthe had got a patrimonial estate in that suit.</p><p>Meanwhile they had slung the mighty boar across the back of a mule, andhaving covered it with sprigs of rosemary and branches of myrtle, theybore it away as the spoils of victory to some large field-tents which hadbeen pitched in the middle of the wood, where they found the tables laidand dinner served, in such grand and sumptuous style that it was easy tosee the rank and magnificence of those who had provided it. Sancho, as heshowed the rents in his torn suit to the duchess, observed, &ldquo;If wehad been hunting hares, or after small birds, my coat would have been safefrom being in the plight it&rsquo;s in; I don&rsquo;t know what pleasureone can find in lying in wait for an animal that may take your life withhis tusk if he gets at you. I recollect having heard an old ballad sungthat says,</p><p class="poem">By bears be thou devoured, as erst<br/>Was famous Favila.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;was a Gothic king, who, goinga-hunting, was devoured by a bear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;and I would not have kings andprinces expose themselves to such dangers for the sake of a pleasurewhich, to my mind, ought not to be one, as it consists in killing ananimal that has done no harm whatever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Quite the contrary, Sancho; you are wrong there,&rdquo; said theduke; &ldquo;for hunting is more suitable and requisite for kings andprinces than for anybody else. The chase is the emblem of war; it hasstratagems, wiles, and crafty devices for overcoming the enemy in safety;in it extreme cold and intolerable heat have to be borne, indolence andsleep are despised, the bodily powers are invigorated, the limbs of himwho engages in it are made supple, and, in a word, it is a pursuit whichmay be followed without injury to anyone and with enjoyment to many; andthe best of it is, it is not for everybody, as field-sports of other sortsare, except hawking, which also is only for kings and great lords.Reconsider your opinion therefore, Sancho, and when you are governor taketo hunting, and you will find the good of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;the good governor should have abroken leg and keep at home;&rdquo; it would be a nice thing if, afterpeople had been at the trouble of coming to look for him on business, thegovernor were to be away in the forest enjoying himself; the governmentwould go on badly in that fashion. By my faith, señor, hunting andamusements are more fit for idlers than for governors; what I intend toamuse myself with is playing all fours at Eastertime, and bowls on Sundaysand holidays; for these huntings don&rsquo;t suit my condition or agreewith my conscience.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God grant it may turn out so,&rdquo; said the duke; &ldquo;becauseit&rsquo;s a long step from saying to doing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be that as it may,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;&lsquo;pledges don&rsquo;tdistress a good payer,&rsquo; and &lsquo;he whom God helps does betterthan he who gets up early,&rsquo; and &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the tripes thatcarry the feet and not the feet the tripes;&rsquo; I mean to say that ifGod gives me help and I do my duty honestly, no doubt I&rsquo;ll governbetter than a gerfalcon. Nay, let them only put a finger in my mouth, andthey&rsquo;ll see whether I can bite or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The curse of God and all his saints upon thee, thou accursedSancho!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Quixote; &ldquo;when will the day come&mdash;asI have often said to thee&mdash;when I shall hear thee make one singlecoherent, rational remark without proverbs? Pray, your highnesses, leavethis fool alone, for he will grind your souls between, not to say two, buttwo thousand proverbs, dragged in as much in season, and as much to thepurpose as&mdash;may God grant as much health to him, or to me if I wantto listen to them!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sancho Panza&rsquo;s proverbs,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;thoughmore in number than the Greek Commander&rsquo;s, are not therefore less tobe esteemed for the conciseness of the maxims. For my own part, I can saythey give me more pleasure than others that may be better brought in andmore seasonably introduced.&rdquo;</p><p>In pleasant conversation of this sort they passed out of the tent into thewood, and the day was spent in visiting some of the posts andhiding-places, and then night closed in, not, however, as brilliantly ortranquilly as might have been expected at the season, for it was thenmidsummer; but bringing with it a kind of haze that greatly aided theproject of the duke and duchess; and thus, as night began to fall, and alittle after twilight set in, suddenly the whole wood on all four sidesseemed to be on fire, and shortly after, here, there, on all sides, a vastnumber of trumpets and other military instruments were heard, as ifseveral troops of cavalry were passing through the wood. The blaze of thefire and the noise of the warlike instruments almost blinded the eyes anddeafened the ears of those that stood by, and indeed of all who were inthe wood. Then there were heard repeated lelilies after the fashion of theMoors when they rush to battle; trumpets and clarions brayed, drums beat,fifes played, so unceasingly and so fast that he could not have had anysenses who did not lose them with the confused din of so many instruments.The duke was astounded, the duchess amazed, Don Quixote wondering, SanchoPanza trembling, and indeed, even they who were aware of the cause werefrightened. In their fear, silence fell upon them, and a postillion, inthe guise of a demon, passed in front of them, blowing, in lieu of abugle, a huge hollow horn that gave out a horrible hoarse note.</p><p>&ldquo;Ho there! brother courier,&rdquo; cried the duke, &ldquo;who areyou? Where are you going? What troops are these that seem to be passingthrough the wood?&rdquo;</p><p>To which the courier replied in a harsh, discordant voice, &ldquo;I am thedevil; I am in search of Don Quixote of La Mancha; those who are comingthis way are six troops of enchanters, who are bringing on a triumphal carthe peerless Dulcinea del Toboso; she comes under enchantment, togetherwith the gallant Frenchman Montesinos, to give instructions to Don Quixoteas to how, she the said lady, may be disenchanted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you were the devil, as you say and as your appearance indicates,&rdquo;said the duke, &ldquo;you would have known the said knight Don Quixote ofLa Mancha, for you have him here before you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God and upon my conscience,&rdquo; said the devil, &ldquo;Inever observed it, for my mind is occupied with so many different thingsthat I was forgetting the main thing I came about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This demon must be an honest fellow and a good Christian,&rdquo;said Sancho; &ldquo;for if he wasn&rsquo;t he wouldn&rsquo;t swear by Godand his conscience; I feel sure now there must be good souls even in hellitself.&rdquo;</p><p>Without dismounting, the demon then turned to Don Quixote and said,&ldquo;The unfortunate but valiant knight Montesinos sends me to thee, theKnight of the Lions (would that I saw thee in their claws), bidding metell thee to wait for him wherever I may find thee, as he brings with himher whom they call Dulcinea del Toboso, that he may show thee what isneedful in order to disenchant her; and as I came for no more I need stayno longer; demons of my sort be with thee, and good angels with thesegentles;&rdquo; and so saying he blew his huge horn, turned about and wentoff without waiting for a reply from anyone.</p><p>They all felt fresh wonder, but particularly Sancho and Don Quixote;Sancho to see how, in defiance of the truth, they would have it thatDulcinea was enchanted; Don Quixote because he could not feel sure whetherwhat had happened to him in the cave of Montesinos was true or not; and ashe was deep in these cogitations the duke said to him, &ldquo;Do you meanto wait, Señor Don Quixote?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;here will I wait, fearless andfirm, though all hell should come to attack me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, if I see another devil or hear another horn like thelast, I&rsquo;ll wait here as much as in Flanders,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>Night now closed in more completely, and many lights began to flit throughthe wood, just as those fiery exhalations from the earth, that look likeshooting-stars to our eyes, flit through the heavens; a frightful noise,too, was heard, like that made by the solid wheels the ox-carts usuallyhave, by the harsh, ceaseless creaking of which, they say, the bears andwolves are put to flight, if there happen to be any where they arepassing. In addition to all this commotion, there came a furtherdisturbance to increase the tumult, for now it seemed as if in truth, onall four sides of the wood, four encounters or battles were going on atthe same time; in one quarter resounded the dull noise of a terriblecannonade, in another numberless muskets were being discharged, the shoutsof the combatants sounded almost close at hand, and farther away theMoorish lelilies were raised again and again. In a word, the bugles, thehorns, the clarions, the trumpets, the drums, the cannon, the musketry,and above all the tremendous noise of the carts, all made up together adin so confused and terrific that Don Quixote had need to summon up allhis courage to brave it; but Sancho&rsquo;s gave way, and he fell faintingon the skirt of the duchess&rsquo;s robe, who let him lie there andpromptly bade them throw water in his face. This was done, and he came tohimself by the time that one of the carts with the creaking wheels reachedthe spot. It was drawn by four plodding oxen all covered with blackhousings; on each horn they had fixed a large lighted wax taper, and onthe top of the cart was constructed a raised seat, on which sat avenerable old man with a beard whiter than the very snow, and so long thatit fell below his waist; he was dressed in a long robe of black buckram;for as the cart was thickly set with a multitude of candles it was easy tomake out everything that was on it. Leading it were two hideous demons,also clad in buckram, with countenances so frightful that Sancho, havingonce seen them, shut his eyes so as not to see them again. As soon as thecart came opposite the spot the old man rose from his lofty seat, andstanding up said in a loud voice, &ldquo;I am the sage Lirgandeo,&rdquo;and without another word the cart then passed on. Behind it came anotherof the same form, with another aged man enthroned, who, stopping the cart,said in a voice no less solemn than that of the first, &ldquo;I am thesage Alquife, the great friend of Urganda the Unknown,&rdquo; and passedon. Then another cart came by at the same pace, but the occupant of thethrone was not old like the others, but a man stalwart and robust, and ofa forbidding countenance, who as he came up said in a voice far hoarserand more devilish, &ldquo;I am the enchanter Archelaus, the mortal enemyof Amadis of Gaul and all his kindred,&rdquo; and then passed on. Havinggone a short distance the three carts halted and the monotonous noise oftheir wheels ceased, and soon after they heard another, not noise, butsound of sweet, harmonious music, of which Sancho was very glad, taking itto be a good sign; and said he to the duchess, from whom he did not stir astep, or for a single instant, &ldquo;Señora, where there&rsquo;s musicthere can&rsquo;t be mischief.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nor where there are lights and it is bright,&rdquo; said theduchess; to which Sancho replied, &ldquo;Fire gives light, and it&rsquo;sbright where there are bonfires, as we see by those that are all round usand perhaps may burn us; but music is a sign of mirth and merrymaking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, who was listeningto all that passed; and he was right, as is shown in the followingchapter.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p34e" id="p34e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p34e.jpg (47K)" src="images/p34e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch35b" id="ch35b"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.<br/>WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE INSTRUCTION GIVEN TO DON QUIXOTE TOUCHING THEDISENCHANTMENT OF DULCINEA, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MARVELLOUS INCIDENTS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p35a" id="p35a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p35a.jpg (108K)" src="images/p35a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p35a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>They saw advancing towards them, to the sound of this pleasing music, whatthey call a triumphal car, drawn by six grey mules with white linenhousings, on each of which was mounted a penitent, robed also in white,with a large lighted wax taper in his hand. The car was twice or, perhaps,three times as large as the former ones, and in front and on the sidesstood twelve more penitents, all as white as snow and all with lightedtapers, a spectacle to excite fear as well as wonder; and on a raisedthrone was seated a nymph draped in a multitude of silver-tissue veilswith an embroidery of countless gold spangles glittering all over them,that made her appear, if not richly, at least brilliantly, apparelled. Shehad her face covered with thin transparent sendal, the texture of whichdid not prevent the fair features of a maiden from being distinguished,while the numerous lights made it possible to judge of her beauty and ofher years, which seemed to be not less than seventeen but not to have yetreached twenty. Beside her was a figure in a robe of state, as they callit, reaching to the feet, while the head was covered with a black veil.But the instant the car was opposite the duke and duchess and Don Quixotethe music of the clarions ceased, and then that of the lutes and harps onthe car, and the figure in the robe rose up, and flinging it apart andremoving the veil from its face, disclosed to their eyes the shape ofDeath itself, fleshless and hideous, at which sight Don Quixote feltuneasy, Sancho frightened, and the duke and duchess displayed a certaintrepidation. Having risen to its feet, this living death, in a sleepyvoice and with a tongue hardly awake, held forth as follows:</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p35b" id="p35b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p35b.jpg (232K)" src="images/p35b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p35b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p class="poem">I am that Merlin who the legends say<br/>The devil had for father, and the lie<br/>Hath gathered credence with the lapse of time.<br/>Of magic prince, of Zoroastric lore<br/>Monarch and treasurer, with jealous eye<br/>I view the efforts of the age to hide<br/>The gallant deeds of doughty errant knights,<br/>Who are, and ever have been, dear to me.<br/>    Enchanters and magicians and their kind<br/>Are mostly hard of heart; not so am I;<br/>For mine is tender, soft, compassionate,<br/>And its delight is doing good to all.<br/>In the dim caverns of the gloomy Dis,<br/>Where, tracing mystic lines and characters,<br/>My soul abideth now, there came to me<br/>The sorrow-laden plaint of her, the fair,<br/>The peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.<br/>I knew of her enchantment and her fate,<br/>From high-born dame to peasant wench transformed<br/>And touched with pity, first I turned the leaves<br/>Of countless volumes of my devilish craft,<br/>And then, in this grim grisly skeleton<br/>Myself encasing, hither have I come<br/>To show where lies the fitting remedy<br/>To give relief in such a piteous case.<br/>    O thou, the pride and pink of all that I wear<br/>The adamantine steel!

Lay on to that hide of thine,thou great untamed brute, rouse up thy lusty vigour that only urges theeto eat and eat, and set free the softness of my flesh, the gentleness ofmy nature, and the fairness of my face. And if thou wilt not relent orcome to reason for me, do so for the sake of that poor knight thou hastbeside thee; thy master I mean, whose soul I can this moment see, how hehas it stuck in his throat not ten fingers from his lips, and only waitingfor thy inflexible or yielding reply to make its escape by his mouth or goback again into his stomach.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote on hearing this felt his throat, and turning to the duke hesaid, &ldquo;By God, señor, Dulcinea says true, I have my soul stuck herein my throat like the nut of a crossbow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What say you to this, Sancho?&rdquo; said the duchess.</p><p>&ldquo;I say, señora,&rdquo; returned Sancho, &ldquo;what I said before;as for the lashes, abernuncio!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Abrenuncio, you should say, Sancho, and not as you do,&rdquo; saidthe duke.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me alone, your highness,&rdquo; said Sancho. &ldquo;I&rsquo;mnot in a humour now to look into niceties or a letter more or less, forthese lashes that are to be given me, or I&rsquo;m to give myself, have soupset me, that I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m saying or doing. But I&rsquo;dlike to know of this lady, my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, where she learnedthis way she has of asking favours. She comes to ask me to score my fleshwith lashes, and she calls me soul of a pitcher, and great untamed brute,and a string of foul names that the devil is welcome to. Is my fleshbrass? or is it anything to me whether she is enchanted or not? Does shebring with her a basket of fair linen, shirts, kerchiefs, socks&mdash;notthat I wear any&mdash;to coax me? No, nothing but one piece of abuse afteranother, though she knows the proverb they have here that &lsquo;an assloaded with gold goes lightly up a mountain,&rsquo; and that &lsquo;giftsbreak rocks,&rsquo; and &lsquo;praying to God and plying the hammer,&rsquo;and that &lsquo;one &ldquo;take&rdquo; is better than two &ldquo;I&rsquo;llgive thee&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&rsquo; Then there&rsquo;s my master, who oughtto stroke me down and pet me to make me turn wool and carded cotton; hesays if he gets hold of me he&rsquo;ll tie me naked to a tree and doublethe tale of lashes on me. These tender-hearted gentry should consider thatit&rsquo;s not merely a squire, but a governor they are asking to whiphimself; just as if it was &lsquo;drink with cherries.&rsquo; Let themlearn, plague take them, the right way to ask, and beg, and behavethemselves; for all times are not alike, nor are people always in goodhumour. I&rsquo;m now ready to burst with grief at seeing my green coattorn, and they come to ask me to whip myself of my own free will, I havingas little fancy for it as for turning cacique.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, the fact is, friend Sancho,&rdquo; said the duke,&ldquo;that unless you become softer than a ripe fig, you shall not gethold of the government. It would be a nice thing for me to send myislanders a cruel governor with flinty bowels, who won&rsquo;t yield tothe tears of afflicted damsels or to the prayers of wise, magisterial,ancient enchanters and sages. In short, Sancho, either you must be whippedby yourself, or they must whip you, or you shan&rsquo;t be governor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t two days&rsquo; gracebe given me in which to consider what is best for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, certainly not,&rdquo; said Merlin; &ldquo;here, this minute,and on the spot, the matter must be settled; either Dulcinea will returnto the cave of Montesinos and to her former condition of peasant wench, orelse in her present form shall be carried to the Elysian fields, where shewill remain waiting until the number of stripes is completed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now then, Sancho!&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;show courage, andgratitude for your master Don Quixote&rsquo;s bread that you have eaten;we are all bound to oblige and please him for his benevolent dispositionand lofty chivalry. Consent to this whipping, my son; to the devil withthe devil, and leave fear to milksops, for &lsquo;a stout heart breaks badluck,&rsquo; as you very well know.&rdquo;</p><p>To this Sancho replied with an irrelevant remark, which, addressingMerlin, he made to him, &ldquo;Will your worship tell me, Señor Merlin&mdash;whenthat courier devil came up he gave my master a message from SeñorMontesinos, charging him to wait for him here, as he was coming to arrangehow the lady Doña Dulcinea del Toboso was to be disenchanted; but up tothe present we have not seen Montesinos, nor anything like him.&rdquo;</p><p>To which Merlin made answer, &ldquo;The devil, Sancho, is a blockhead anda great scoundrel; I sent him to look for your master, but not with amessage from Montesinos but from myself; for Montesinos is in his caveexpecting, or more properly speaking, waiting for his disenchantment; forthere&rsquo;s the tail to be skinned yet for him; if he owes you anything,or you have any business to transact with him, I&rsquo;ll bring him to youand put him where you choose; but for the present make up your mind toconsent to this penance, and believe me it will be very good for you, forsoul as well for body&mdash;for your soul because of the charity withwhich you perform it, for your body because I know that you are of asanguine habit and it will do you no harm to draw a little blood.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are a great many doctors in the world; even the enchantersare doctors,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;however, as everybody tells me thesame thing&mdash;though I can&rsquo;t see it myself&mdash;I say I amwilling to give myself the three thousand three hundred lashes, provided Iam to lay them on whenever I like, without any fixing of days or times;and I&rsquo;ll try and get out of debt as quickly as I can, that the worldmay enjoy the beauty of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso; as it seems,contrary to what I thought, that she is beautiful after all. It must be acondition, too, that I am not to be bound to draw blood with the scourge,and that if any of the lashes happen to be fly-flappers they are to count.Item, that, in case I should make any mistake in the reckoning, SeñorMerlin, as he knows everything, is to keep count, and let me know how manyare still wanting or over the number.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There will be no need to let you know of any over,&rdquo; saidMerlin, &ldquo;because, when you reach the full number, the lady Dulcineawill at once, and that very instant, be disenchanted, and will come in hergratitude to seek out the worthy Sancho, and thank him, and even rewardhim for the good work. So you have no cause to be uneasy about stripes toomany or too few; heaven forbid I should cheat anyone of even a hair of hishead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, in God&rsquo;s hands be it,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;inthe hard case I&rsquo;m in I give in; I say I accept the penance on theconditions laid down.&rdquo;</p><p>The instant Sancho uttered these last words the music of the clarionsstruck up once more, and again a host of muskets were discharged, and DonQuixote hung on Sancho&rsquo;s neck kissing him again and again on theforehead and cheeks. The duchess and the duke expressed the greatestsatisfaction, the car began to move on, and as it passed the fair Dulcineabowed to the duke and duchess and made a low curtsey to Sancho.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p35c" id="p35c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p35c.jpg (284K)" src="images/p35c.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p35c.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>And now bright smiling dawn came on apace; the flowers of the field,revived, raised up their heads, and the crystal waters of the brooks,murmuring over the grey and white pebbles, hastened to pay their tributeto the expectant rivers; the glad earth, the unclouded sky, the freshbreeze, the clear light, each and all showed that the day that cametreading on the skirts of morning would be calm and bright.

Thou wilt not understand thisjust now, my Teresa; by-and-by thou wilt know what it means. I may tell thee,Teresa, I mean thee to go in a coach, for that is a matter of importance,because every other way of going is going on all-fours. Thou art agovernor&rsquo;s wife; take care that nobody speaks evil of thee behind thyback. I send thee here a green hunting suit that my lady the duchess gave me;alter it so as to make a petticoat and bodice for our daughter. Don Quixote, mymaster, if I am to believe what I hear in these parts, is a madman of somesense, and a droll blockhead, and I am in no way behind him. We have been inthe cave of Montesinos, and the sage Merlin has laid hold of me for thedisenchantment of Dulcinea del Toboso, her that is called Aldonza Lorenzo overthere. With three thousand three hundred lashes, less five, that I&rsquo;m togive myself, she will be left as entirely disenchanted as the mother that boreher. Say nothing of this to anyone; for, make thy affairs public, and some willsay they are white and others will say they are black. I shall leave this in afew days for my government, to which I am going with a mighty great desire tomake money, for they tell me all new governors set out with the same desire; Iwill feel the pulse of it and will let thee know if thou art to come and livewith me or not. Dapple is well and sends many remembrances to thee; I am notgoing to leave him behind though they took me away to be Grand Turk. My ladythe duchess kisses thy hands a thousand times; do thou make a return with twothousand, for as my master says, nothing costs less or is cheaper thancivility. God has not been pleased to provide another valise for me withanother hundred crowns, like the one the other day; but never mind, my Teresa,the bell-ringer is in safe quarters, and all will come out in the scouring ofthe government; only it troubles me greatly what they tell me&mdash;that once Ihave tasted it I will eat my hands off after it; and if that is so it will notcome very cheap to me; though to be sure the maimed have a benefice of theirown in the alms they beg for; so that one way or another thou wilt be rich andin luck.

From thiscastle, the 20th of July, 1614.</p><p class="right">Thy husband, the governor,<br/>SANCHO PANZA</p><p>When she had done reading the letter the duchess said to Sancho, &ldquo;Ontwo points the worthy governor goes rather astray; one is in saying orhinting that this government has been bestowed upon him for the lashesthat he is to give himself, when he knows (and he cannot deny it) thatwhen my lord the duke promised it to him nobody ever dreamt of such athing as lashes; the other is that he shows himself here to be verycovetous; and I would not have him a money-seeker, for &lsquo;covetousnessbursts the bag,&rsquo; and the covetous governor does ungoverned justice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean it that way, señora,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;andif you think the letter doesn&rsquo;t run as it ought to do, it&rsquo;sonly to tear it up and make another; and maybe it will be a worse one ifit is left to my gumption.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;this one will do, and Iwish the duke to see it.&rdquo;</p><p>With this they betook themselves to a garden where they were to dine, andthe duchess showed Sancho&rsquo;s letter to the duke, who was highlydelighted with it. They dined, and after the cloth had been removed andthey had amused themselves for a while with Sancho&rsquo;s richconversation, the melancholy sound of a fife and harsh discordant drummade itself heard. All seemed somewhat put out by this dull, confused,martial harmony, especially Don Quixote, who could not keep his seat frompure disquietude; as to Sancho, it is needless to say that fear drove himto his usual refuge, the side or the skirts of the duchess; and indeed andin truth the sound they heard was a most doleful and melancholy one. Whilethey were still in uncertainty they saw advancing towards them through thegarden two men clad in mourning robes so long and flowing that theytrailed upon the ground. As they marched they beat two great drums whichwere likewise draped in black, and beside them came the fife player, blackand sombre like the others. Following these came a personage of giganticstature enveloped rather than clad in a gown of the deepest black, theskirt of which was of prodigious dimensions. Over the gown, girdling orcrossing his figure, he had a broad baldric which was also black, and fromwhich hung a huge scimitar with a black scabbard and furniture. He had hisface covered with a transparent black veil, through which might bedescried a very long beard as white as snow. He came on keeping step tothe sound of the drums with great gravity and dignity; and, in short, hisstature, his gait, the sombreness of his appearance and his followingmight well have struck with astonishment, as they did, all who beheld himwithout knowing who he was. With this measured pace and in this guise headvanced to kneel before the duke, who, with the others, awaited himstanding. The duke, however, would not on any account allow him to speakuntil he had risen. The prodigious scarecrow obeyed, and standing up,removed the veil from his face and disclosed the most enormous, thelongest, the whitest and the thickest beard that human eyes had everbeheld until that moment, and then fetching up a grave, sonorous voicefrom the depths of his broad, capacious chest, and fixing his eyes on theduke, he said:</p><p>&ldquo;Most high and mighty señor, my name is Trifaldin of the WhiteBeard; I am squire to the Countess Trifaldi, otherwise called theDistressed Duenna, on whose behalf I bear a message to your highness,which is that your magnificence will be pleased to grant her leave andpermission to come and tell you her trouble, which is one of the strangestand most wonderful that the mind most familiar with trouble in the worldcould have imagined; but first she desires to know if the valiant andnever vanquished knight, Don Quixote of La Mancha, is in this your castle,for she has come in quest of him on foot and without breaking her fastfrom the kingdom of Kandy to your realms here; a thing which may and oughtto be regarded as a miracle or set down to enchantment; she is even now atthe gate of this fortress or plaisance, and only waits for your permissionto enter. I have spoken.&rdquo; And with that he coughed, and stroked downhis beard with both his hands, and stood very tranquilly waiting for theresponse of the duke, which was to this effect: &ldquo;Many days ago,worthy squire Trifaldin of the White Beard, we heard of the misfortune ofmy lady the Countess Trifaldi, whom the enchanters have caused to becalled the Distressed Duenna. Bid her enter, O stupendous squire, and tellher that the valiant knight Don Quixote of La Mancha is here, and from hisgenerous disposition she may safely promise herself every protection andassistance; and you may tell her, too, that if my aid be necessary it willnot be withheld, for I am bound to give it to her by my quality of knight,which involves the protection of women of all sorts, especially widowed,wronged, and distressed dames, such as her ladyship seems to be.&rdquo;</p><p>On hearing this Trifaldin bent the knee to the ground, and making a signto the fifer and drummers to strike up, he turned and marched out of thegarden to the same notes and at the same pace as when he entered, leavingthem all amazed at his bearing and solemnity. Turning to Don Quixote, theduke said, &ldquo;After all, renowned knight, the mists of malice andignorance are unable to hide or obscure the light of valour and virtue. Isay so, because your excellence has been barely six days in this castle,and already the unhappy and the afflicted come in quest of you from landsfar distant and remote, and not in coaches or on dromedaries, but on footand fasting, confident that in that mighty arm they will find a cure fortheir sorrows and troubles; thanks to your great achievements, which arecirculated all over the known earth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I wish, señor duke,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;that blessedecclesiastic, who at table the other day showed such ill-will and bitterspite against knights-errant, were here now to see with his own eyeswhether knights of the sort are needed in the world; he would at any ratelearn by experience that those suffering any extraordinary affliction orsorrow, in extreme cases and unusual misfortunes do not go to look for aremedy to the houses of jurists or village sacristans, or to the knightwho has never attempted to pass the bounds of his own town, or to theindolent courtier who only seeks for news to repeat and talk of, insteadof striving to do deeds and exploits for others to relate and record.Relief in distress, help in need, protection for damsels, consolation forwidows, are to be found in no sort of persons better than inknights-errant; and I give unceasing thanks to heaven that I am one, andregard any misfortune or suffering that may befall me in the pursuit of sohonourable a calling as endured to good purpose. Let this duenna come andask what she will, for I will effect her relief by the might of my arm andthe dauntless resolution of my bold heart.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p36e" id="p36e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p36e.jpg (22K)" src="images/p36e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch37b" id="ch37b"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.<br/>WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE DISTRESSED DUENNA</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p37a" id="p37a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p37a.jpg (94K)" src="images/p37a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p37a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The duke and duchess were extremely glad to see how readily Don Quixotefell in with their scheme; but at this moment Sancho observed, &ldquo;Ihope this señora duenna won&rsquo;t be putting any difficulties in the wayof the promise of my government; for I have heard a Toledo apothecary, whotalked like a goldfinch, say that where duennas were mixed up nothing goodcould happen. God bless me, how he hated them, that same apothecary! Andso what I&rsquo;m thinking is, if all duennas, of whatever sort orcondition they may be, are plagues and busybodies, what must they be thatare distressed, like this Countess Three-skirts or Three-tails!&mdash;forin my country skirts or tails, tails or skirts, it&rsquo;s all one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hush, friend Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;since thislady duenna comes in quest of me from such a distant land she cannot beone of those the apothecary meant; moreover this is a countess, and whencountesses serve as duennas it is in the service of queens and empresses,for in their own houses they are mistresses paramount and have otherduennas to wait on them.&rdquo;</p><p>To this Doña Rodriguez, who was present, made answer, &ldquo;My lady theduchess has duennas in her service that might be countesses if it was thewill of fortune; &lsquo;but laws go as kings like;&rsquo; let nobody speakill of duennas, above all of ancient maiden ones; for though I am not onemyself, I know and am aware of the advantage a maiden duenna has over onethat is a widow; but &lsquo;he who clipped us has kept the scissors.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s so much tobe clipped about duennas, so my barber said, that &lsquo;it will be betternot to stir the rice even though it sticks.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;These squires,&rdquo; returned Doña Rodriguez, &ldquo;are alwaysour enemies; and as they are the haunting spirits of the antechambers andwatch us at every step, whenever they are not saying their prayers (andthat&rsquo;s often enough) they spend their time in tattling about us,digging up our bones and burying our good name. But I can tell thesewalking blocks that we will live in spite of them, and in great housestoo, though we die of hunger and cover our flesh, be it delicate or not,with widow&rsquo;s weeds, as one covers or hides a dunghill on aprocession day. By my faith, if it were permitted me and time allowed, Icould prove, not only to those here present, but to all the world, thatthere is no virtue that is not to be found in a duenna.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have no doubt,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;that my good DoñaRodriguez is right, and very much so; but she had better bide her time forfighting her own battle and that of the rest of the duennas, so as tocrush the calumny of that vile apothecary, and root out the prejudice inthe great Sancho Panza&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;</p><p>To which Sancho replied, &ldquo;Ever since I have sniffed the governorshipI have got rid of the humours of a squire, and I don&rsquo;t care a wildfig for all the duennas in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>They would have carried on this duenna dispute further had they not heardthe notes of the fife and drums once more, from which they concluded thatthe Distressed Duenna was making her entrance. The duchess asked the dukeif it would be proper to go out to receive her, as she was a countess anda person of rank.</p><p>&ldquo;In respect of her being a countess,&rdquo; said Sancho, before theduke could reply, &ldquo;I am for your highnesses going out to receiveher; but in respect of her being a duenna, it is my opinion you should notstir a step.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who bade thee meddle in this, Sancho?&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Who, señor?&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I meddle for I have a rightto meddle, as a squire who has learned the rules of courtesy in the schoolof your worship, the most courteous and best-bred knight in the wholeworld of courtliness; and in these things, as I have heard your worshipsay, as much is lost by a card too many as by a card too few, and to onewho has his ears open, few words.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sancho is right,&rdquo; said the duke; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see whatthe countess is like, and by that measure the courtesy that is due to her.&rdquo;</p><p>And now the drums and fife made their entrance as before; and here theauthor brought this short chapter to an end and began the next, followingup the same adventure, which is one of the most notable in the history.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p37e" id="p37e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p37e.jpg (21K)" src="images/p37e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch38b" id="ch38b"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br/>WHEREIN IS TOLD THE DISTRESSED DUENNA&rsquo;S TALE OF HER MISFORTUNES</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p38a" id="p38a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p38a.jpg (54K)" src="images/p38a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p38a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Following the melancholy musicians there filed into the garden as many astwelve duennas, in two lines, all dressed in ample mourning robesapparently of milled serge, with hoods of fine white gauze so long thatthey allowed only the border of the robe to be seen. Behind them came theCountess Trifaldi, the squire Trifaldin of the White Beard leading her bythe hand, clad in the finest unnapped black baize, such that, had it anap, every tuft would have shown as big as a Martos chickpea; the tail, orskirt, or whatever it might be called, ended in three points which wereborne up by the hands of three pages, likewise dressed in mourning,forming an elegant geometrical figure with the three acute angles made bythe three points, from which all who saw the peaked skirt concluded thatit must be because of it the countess was called Trifaldi, as though itwere Countess of the Three Skirts; and Benengeli says it was so, and thatby her right name she was called the Countess Lobuna, because wolves bredin great numbers in her country; and if, instead of wolves, they had beenfoxes, she would have been called the Countess Zorruna, as it was thecustom in those parts for lords to take distinctive titles from the thingor things most abundant in their dominions; this countess, however, inhonour of the new fashion of her skirt, dropped Lobuna and took upTrifaldi.</p><p>The twelve duennas and the lady came on at procession pace, their facesbeing covered with black veils, not transparent ones like Trifaldin&rsquo;s,but so close that they allowed nothing to be seen through them. As soon asthe band of duennas was fully in sight, the duke, the duchess, and DonQuixote stood up, as well as all who were watching the slow-movingprocession. The twelve duennas halted and formed a lane, along which theDistressed One advanced, Trifaldin still holding her hand. On seeing thisthe duke, the duchess, and Don Quixote went some twelve paces forward tomeet her. She then, kneeling on the ground, said in a voice hoarse andrough, rather than fine and delicate, &ldquo;May it please your highnessesnot to offer such courtesies to this your servant, I should say to thisyour handmaid, for I am in such distress that I shall never be able tomake a proper return, because my strange and unparalleled misfortune hascarried off my wits, and I know not whither; but it must be a long wayoff, for the more I look for them the less I find them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He would be wanting in wits, señora countess,&rdquo; said the duke,&ldquo;who did not perceive your worth by your person, for at a glance itmay be seen it deserves all the cream of courtesy and flower of politeusage;&rdquo; and raising her up by the hand he led her to a seat besidethe duchess, who likewise received her with great urbanity. Don Quixoteremained silent, while Sancho was dying to see the features of Trifaldiand one or two of her many duennas; but there was no possibility of ituntil they themselves displayed them of their own accord and free will.</p><p>All kept still, waiting to see who would break silence, which theDistressed Duenna did in these words: &ldquo;I am confident, most mightylord, most fair lady, and most discreet company, that my most miserablemisery will be accorded a reception no less dispassionate than generousand condolent in your most valiant bosoms, for it is one that is enough tomelt marble, soften diamonds, and mollify the steel of the most hardenedhearts in the world; but ere it is proclaimed to your hearing, not to sayyour ears, I would fain be enlightened whether there be present in thissociety, circle, or company, that knight immaculatissimus, Don Quixote dela Manchissima, and his squirissimus Panza.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Panza is here,&rdquo; said Sancho, before anyone could reply,&ldquo;and Don Quixotissimus too; and so, most distressedest Duenissima,you may say what you willissimus, for we are all readissimus to do you anyservissimus.&rdquo;</p><p>On this Don Quixote rose, and addressing the Distressed Duenna, said,&ldquo;If your sorrows, afflicted lady, can indulge in any hope of relieffrom the valour or might of any knight-errant, here are mine, which,feeble and limited though they be, shall be entirely devoted to yourservice. I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose calling it is to give aid tothe needy of all sorts; and that being so, it is not necessary for you,señora, to make any appeal to benevolence, or deal in preambles, only totell your woes plainly and straightforwardly: for you have hearers thatwill know how, if not to remedy them, to sympathise with them.&rdquo;</p><p>On hearing this, the Distressed Duenna made as though she would throwherself at Don Quixote&rsquo;s feet, and actually did fall before them andsaid, as she strove to embrace them, &ldquo;Before these feet and legs Icast myself, O unconquered knight, as before, what they are, thefoundations and pillars of knight-errantry; these feet I desire to kiss,for upon their steps hangs and depends the sole remedy for my misfortune,O valorous errant, whose veritable achievements leave behind and eclipsethe fabulous ones of the Amadises, Esplandians, and Belianises!&rdquo;Then turning from Don Quixote to Sancho Panza, and grasping his hands, shesaid, &ldquo;O thou, most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant inthis present age or ages past, whose goodness is more extensive than thebeard of Trifaldin my companion here of present, well mayest thou boastthyself that, in serving the great Don Quixote, thou art serving, summedup in one, the whole host of knights that have ever borne arms in theworld. I conjure thee, by what thou owest to thy most loyal goodness, thatthou wilt become my kind intercessor with thy master, that he speedilygive aid to this most humble and most unfortunate countess.&rdquo;</p><p>To this Sancho made answer, &ldquo;As to my goodness, señora, being aslong and as great as your squire&rsquo;s beard, it matters very little tome; may I have my soul well bearded and moustached when it comes to quitthis life, that&rsquo;s the point; about beards here below I care littleor nothing; but without all these blandishments and prayers, I will beg mymaster (for I know he loves me, and, besides, he has need of me just nowfor a certain business) to help and aid your worship as far as he can;unpack your woes and lay them before us, and leave us to deal with them,for we&rsquo;ll be all of one mind.&rdquo;</p><p>The duke and duchess, as it was they who had made the experiment of thisadventure, were ready to burst with laughter at all this, and betweenthemselves they commended the clever acting of the Trifaldi, who,returning to her seat, said, &ldquo;Queen Doña Maguncia reigned over thefamous kingdom of Kandy, which lies between the great Trapobana and theSouthern Sea, two leagues beyond Cape Comorin. She was the widow of KingArchipiela, her lord and husband, and of their marriage they had issue thePrincess Antonomasia, heiress of the kingdom; which Princess Antonomasiawas reared and brought up under my care and direction, I being the oldestand highest in rank of her mother&rsquo;s duennas. Time passed, and theyoung Antonomasia reached the age of fourteen, and such a perfection ofbeauty, that nature could not raise it higher. Then, it must not besupposed her intelligence was childish; she was as intelligent as she wasfair, and she was fairer than all the world; and is so still, unless theenvious fates and hard-hearted sisters three have cut for her the threadof life. But that they have not, for Heaven will not suffer so great awrong to Earth, as it would be to pluck unripe the grapes of the fairestvineyard on its surface. Of this beauty, to which my poor feeble tonguehas failed to do justice, countless princes, not only of that country, butof others, were enamoured, and among them a private gentleman, who was atthe court, dared to raise his thoughts to the heaven of so great beauty,trusting to his youth, his gallant bearing, his numerous accomplishmentsand graces, and his quickness and readiness of wit; for I may tell yourhighnesses, if I am not wearying you, that he played the guitar so as tomake it speak, and he was, besides, a poet and a great dancer, and hecould make birdcages so well, that by making them alone he might havegained a livelihood, had he found himself reduced to utter poverty; andgifts and graces of this kind are enough to bring down a mountain, not tosay a tender young girl. But all his gallantry, wit, and gaiety, all hisgraces and accomplishments, would have been of little or no avail towardsgaining the fortress of my pupil, had not the impudent thief taken theprecaution of gaining me over first. First, the villain and heartlessvagabond sought to win my good-will and purchase my compliance, so as toget me, like a treacherous warder, to deliver up to him the keys of thefortress I had in charge. In a word, he gained an influence over my mind,and overcame my resolutions with I know not what trinkets and jewels hegave me; but it was some verses I heard him singing one night from agrating that opened on the street where he lived, that, more than anythingelse, made me give way and led to my fall; and if I remember rightly theyran thus:</p><p class="poem">From that sweet enemy of mine<br/>    My bleeding heart hath had its wound;<br/>    And to increase the pain I&rsquo;m bound<br/>To suffer and to make no sign.</p><p>The lines seemed pearls to me and his voice sweet as syrup; andafterwards, I may say ever since then, looking at the misfortune intowhich I have fallen, I have thought that poets, as Plato advised, ought tobe banished from all well-ordered States; at least the amatory ones, forthey write verses, not like those of &lsquo;The Marquis of Mantua,&rsquo;that delight and draw tears from the women and children, but sharp-pointedconceits that pierce the heart like soft thorns, and like the lightningstrike it, leaving the raiment uninjured. Another time he sang:</p><p class="poem">Come Death, so subtly veiled that I<br/>    Thy coming know not, how or when,<br/>    Lest it should give me life again<br/>To find how sweet it is to die.</p><p class="noindent">&mdash;and other verses and burdens of the same sort, such as enchant when sungand fascinate when written. And then, when they condescend to compose a sort ofverse that was at that time in vogue in Kandy, which they call seguidillas!Then it is that hearts leap and laughter breaks forth, and the body growsrestless and all the senses turn quicksilver. And so I say, sirs, that thesetroubadours richly deserve to be banished to the isles of the lizards. Thoughit is not they that are in fault, but the simpletons that extol them, and thefools that believe in them; and had I been the faithful duenna I should havebeen, his stale conceits would have never moved me, nor should I have beentaken in by such phrases as &lsquo;in death I live,&rsquo; &lsquo;in ice Iburn,&rsquo; &lsquo;in flames I shiver,&rsquo; &lsquo;hopeless I hope,&rsquo;&lsquo;I go and stay,&rsquo; and paradoxes of that sort which their writingsare full of. And then when they promise the Phœnix of Arabia, the crown ofAriadne, the horses of the Sun, the pearls of the South, the gold of Tibar, andthe balsam of Panchaia! Then it is they give a loose to their pens, for itcosts them little to make promises they have no intention or power offulfilling. But where am I wandering to? Woe is me, unfortunate being! Whatmadness or folly leads me to speak of the faults of others, when there is somuch to be said about my own? Again, woe is me, hapless that I am! it was notverses that conquered me, but my own simplicity; it was not music made meyield, but my own imprudence; my own great ignorance and little caution openedthe way and cleared the path for Don Clavijo&rsquo;s advances, for that was thename of the gentleman I have referred to; and so, with my help as go-between,he found his way many a time into the chamber of the deceived Antonomasia(deceived not by him but by me) under the title of a lawful husband; for,sinner though I was, I would not have allowed him to approach the edge of hershoe-sole without being her husband. No, no, not that; marriage must come firstin any business of this sort that I take in hand. But there was one hitch inthis case, which was that of inequality of rank, Don Clavijo being a privategentleman, and the Princess Antonomasia, as I said, heiress to the kingdom. Theentanglement remained for some time a secret, kept hidden by my cunningprecautions, until I perceived that a certain expansion of waist in Antonomasiamust before long disclose it, the dread of which made us all there take counseltogether, and it was agreed that before the mischief came to light, Don Clavijoshould demand Antonomasia as his wife before the Vicar, in virtue of anagreement to marry him made by the princess, and drafted by my wit in suchbinding terms that the might of Samson could not have broken it. The necessarysteps were taken; the Vicar saw the agreement, and took the lady&rsquo;sconfession; she confessed everything in full, and he ordered her into thecustody of a very worthy alguacil of the court.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are there alguacils of the court in Kandy, too,&rdquo; said Sanchoat this, &ldquo;and poets, and seguidillas? I swear I think the world isthe same all over! But make haste, Señora Trifaldi; for it is late, and Iam dying to know the end of this long story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; replied the countess.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p38e" id="p38e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p38e.jpg (22K)" src="images/p38e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch39b" id="ch39b"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX.<br/>IN WHICH THE TRIFALDI CONTINUES HER MARVELLOUS AND MEMORABLE STORY</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p39a" id="p39a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p39a.jpg (96K)" src="images/p39a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p39a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>By every word that Sancho uttered, the duchess was as much delighted asDon Quixote was driven to desperation. He bade him hold his tongue, andthe Distressed One went on to say: &ldquo;At length, after muchquestioning and answering, as the princess held to her story, withoutchanging or varying her previous declaration, the Vicar gave his decisionin favour of Don Clavijo, and she was delivered over to him as his lawfulwife; which the Queen Doña Maguncia, the Princess Antonomasia&rsquo;smother, so took to heart, that within the space of three days we buriedher.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She died, no doubt,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Trifaldin; &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t buryliving people in Kandy, only the dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor Squire,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;a man in a swoon has beenknown to be buried before now, in the belief that he was dead; and itstruck me that Queen Maguncia ought to have swooned rather than died;because with life a great many things come right, and the princess&rsquo;sfolly was not so great that she need feel it so keenly. If the lady hadmarried some page of hers, or some other servant of the house, as manyanother has done, so I have heard say, then the mischief would have beenpast curing. But to marry such an elegant accomplished gentleman as hasbeen just now described to us&mdash;indeed, indeed, though it was a folly,it was not such a great one as you think; for according to the rules of mymaster here&mdash;and he won&rsquo;t allow me to lie&mdash;as of men ofletters bishops are made, so of gentlemen knights, specially if they beerrant, kings and emperors may be made.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art right, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for with aknight-errant, if he has but two fingers&rsquo; breadth of good fortune,it is on the cards to become the mightiest lord on earth. But let señorathe Distressed One proceed; for I suspect she has got yet to tell us thebitter part of this so far sweet story.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The bitter is indeed to come,&rdquo; said the countess; &ldquo;and suchbitter that colocynth is sweet and oleander toothsome in comparison. The queen,then, being dead, and not in a swoon, we buried her; and hardly had we coveredher with earth, hardly had we said our last farewells, when, <i>quis taliafando temperet a lachrymis?</i> over the queen&rsquo;s grave there appeared,mounted upon a wooden horse, the giant Malambruno, Maguncia&rsquo;s firstcousin, who besides being cruel is an enchanter; and he, to revenge the deathof his cousin, punish the audacity of Don Clavijo, and in wrath at thecontumacy of Antonomasia, left them both enchanted by his art on the graveitself; she being changed into an ape of brass, and he into a horriblecrocodile of some unknown metal; while between the two there stands a pillar,also of metal, with certain characters in the Syriac language inscribed uponit, which, being translated into Kandian, and now into Castilian, contain thefollowing sentence: &lsquo;These two rash lovers shall not recover their formershape until the valiant Manchegan comes to do battle with me in single combat;for the Fates reserve this unexampled adventure for his mighty valouralone.&rsquo; This done, he drew from its sheath a huge broad scimitar, andseizing me by the hair he made as though he meant to cut my throat and shear myhead clean off. I was terror-stricken, my voice stuck in my throat, and I wasin the deepest distress; nevertheless I summoned up my strength as well as Icould, and in a trembling and piteous voice I addressed such words to him asinduced him to stay the infliction of a punishment so severe. He then causedall the duennas of the palace, those that are here present, to be broughtbefore him; and after having dwelt upon the enormity of our offence, anddenounced duennas, their characters, their evil ways and worse intrigues,laying to the charge of all what I alone was guilty of, he said he would notvisit us with capital punishment, but with others of a slow nature which wouldbe in effect civil death for ever; and the very instant he ceased speaking weall felt the pores of our faces opening, and pricking us, as if with the pointsof needles. We at once put our hands up to our faces and found ourselves in thestate you now see.&rdquo;</p><p>Here the Distressed One and the other duennas raised the veils with whichthey were covered, and disclosed countenances all bristling with beards,some red, some black, some white, and some grizzled, at which spectaclethe duke and duchess made a show of being filled with wonder. Don Quixoteand Sancho were overwhelmed with amazement, and the bystanders lost inastonishment, while the Trifaldi went on to say: &ldquo;Thus did thatmalevolent villain Malambruno punish us, covering the tenderness andsoftness of our faces with these rough bristles! Would to heaven that hehad swept off our heads with his enormous scimitar instead of obscuringthe light of our countenances with these wool-combings that cover us! Forif we look into the matter, sirs (and what I am now going to say I wouldsay with eyes flowing like fountains, only that the thought of ourmisfortune and the oceans they have already wept, keep them as dry asbarley spears, and so I say it without tears), where, I ask, can a duennawith a beard go to? What father or mother will feel pity for her? Who willhelp her? For, if even when she has a smooth skin, and a face tortured bya thousand kinds of washes and cosmetics, she can hardly get anybody tolove her, what will she do when she shows a countenance turned into athicket? Oh duennas, companions mine! it was an unlucky moment when wewere born and an ill-starred hour when our fathers begot us!&rdquo; And asshe said this she showed signs of being about to faint.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p39e" id="p39e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p39e.jpg (27K)" src="images/p39e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch40b" id="ch40b"></a>CHAPTER XL.<br/>OF MATTERS RELATING AND BELONGING TO THIS ADVENTURE AND TO THIS MEMORABLEHISTORY</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p40a" id="p40a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p40a.jpg (129K)" src="images/p40a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p40a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Verily and truly all those who find pleasure in histories like this oughtshow their gratitude to Cide Hamete, its original author, for thescrupulous care he has taken to set before us all its minute particulars,not leaving anything, however trifling it may be, that he does not makeclear and plain.

O renowned author! O happy Don Quixote! O famous famous drollSancho! All and each, may ye live countless ages for the delight andamusement of the dwellers on earth!</p><p>The history goes on to say that when Sancho saw the Distressed One fainthe exclaimed: &ldquo;I swear by the faith of an honest man and the shadesof all my ancestors the Panzas, that never I did see or hear of, nor hasmy master related or conceived in his mind, such an adventure as this. Athousand devils&mdash;not to curse thee&mdash;take thee, Malambruno, foran enchanter and a giant! Couldst thou find no other sort of punishmentfor these sinners but bearding them? Would it not have been better&mdash;itwould have been better for them&mdash;to have taken off half their nosesfrom the middle upwards, even though they&rsquo;d have snuffled when theyspoke, than to have put beards on them? I&rsquo;ll bet they have not themeans of paying anybody to shave them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the truth, señor,&rdquo; said one of the twelve; &ldquo;wehave not the money to get ourselves shaved, and so we have, some of us,taken to using sticking-plasters by way of an economical remedy, for byapplying them to our faces and plucking them off with a jerk we are leftas bare and smooth as the bottom of a stone mortar. There are, to be sure,women in Kandy that go about from house to house to remove down, and trimeyebrows, and make cosmetics for the use of the women, but we, the duennasof my lady, would never let them in, for most of them have a flavour ofagents that have ceased to be principals; and if we are not relieved bySeñor Don Quixote we shall be carried to our graves with beards.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will pluck out my own in the land of the Moors,&rdquo; said DonQuixote, &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t cure yours.&rdquo;</p><p>At this instant the Trifaldi recovered from her swoon and said, &ldquo;Thechink of that promise, valiant knight, reached my ears in the midst of myswoon, and has been the means of reviving me and bringing back my senses;and so once more I implore you, illustrious errant, indomitable sir, tolet your gracious promises be turned into deeds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There shall be no delay on my part,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.&ldquo;Bethink you, señora, of what I must do, for my heart is most eagerto serve you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; replied the Distressed One, &ldquo;it is fivethousand leagues, a couple more or less, from this to the kingdom ofKandy, if you go by land; but if you go through the air and in a straightline, it is three thousand two hundred and twenty-seven. You must know,too, that Malambruno told me that, whenever fate provided the knight ourdeliverer, he himself would send him a steed far better and with lesstricks than a post-horse; for he will be that same wooden horse on whichthe valiant Pierres carried off the fair Magalona; which said horse isguided by a peg he has in his forehead that serves for a bridle, and fliesthrough the air with such rapidity that you would fancy the very devilswere carrying him. This horse, according to ancient tradition, was made byMerlin. He lent him to Pierres, who was a friend of his, and who made longjourneys with him, and, as has been said, carried off the fair Magalona,bearing her through the air on its haunches and making all who beheld themfrom the earth gape with astonishment; and he never lent him save to thosewhom he loved or those who paid him well; and since the great Pierres weknow of no one having mounted him until now. From him Malambruno stole himby his magic art, and he has him now in his possession, and makes use ofhim in his journeys which he constantly makes through different parts ofthe world; he is here to-day, to-morrow in France, and the next day inPotosi; and the best of it is the said horse neither eats nor sleeps norwears out shoes, and goes at an ambling pace through the air withoutwings, so that he whom he has mounted upon him can carry a cup full ofwater in his hand without spilling a drop, so smoothly and easily does hego, for which reason the fair Magalona enjoyed riding him greatly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For going smoothly and easily,&rdquo; said Sancho at this, &ldquo;giveme my Dapple, though he can&rsquo;t go through the air; but on the groundI&rsquo;ll back him against all the amblers in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>They all laughed, and the Distressed One continued: &ldquo;And this samehorse, if so be that Malambruno is disposed to put an end to oursufferings, will be here before us ere the night shall have advanced halfan hour; for he announced to me that the sign he would give me whereby Imight know that I had found the knight I was in quest of, would be to sendme the horse wherever he might be, speedily and promptly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how many is there room for on this horse?&rdquo; asked Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; said the Distressed One, &ldquo;one in the saddle, andthe other on the croup; and generally these two are knight and squire,when there is no damsel that&rsquo;s being carried off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know, Señora Distressed One,&rdquo; said Sancho,&ldquo;what is the name of this horse?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;His name,&rdquo; said the Distressed One, &ldquo;is not the same asBellerophon&rsquo;s horse that was called Pegasus, or Alexander the Great&rsquo;s,called Bucephalus, or Orlando Furioso&rsquo;s, the name of which wasBrigliador, nor yet Bayard, the horse of Reinaldos of Montalvan, norFrontino like Ruggiero&rsquo;s, nor Bootes or Peritoa, as they say thehorses of the sun were called, nor is he called Orelia, like the horse onwhich the unfortunate Rodrigo, the last king of the Goths, rode to thebattle where he lost his life and his kingdom.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that as they have givenhim none of these famous names of well-known horses, no more have theygiven him the name of my master&rsquo;s Rocinante, which for being aptsurpasses all that have been mentioned.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the bearded countess, &ldquo;still itfits him very well, for he is called Clavileño the Swift, which name is inaccordance with his being made of wood, with the peg he has in hisforehead, and with the swift pace at which he travels; and so, as far asname goes, he may compare with the famous Rocinante.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say against his name,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;butwith what sort of bridle or halter is he managed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have said already,&rdquo; said the Trifaldi, &ldquo;that it iswith a peg, by turning which to one side or the other the knight who rideshim makes him go as he pleases, either through the upper air, or skimmingand almost sweeping the earth, or else in that middle course that issought and followed in all well-regulated proceedings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see him,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;but to fancyI&rsquo;m going to mount him, either in the saddle or on the croup, is toask pears of the elm tree. A good joke indeed! I can hardly keep my seatupon Dapple, and on a pack-saddle softer than silk itself, and here they&rsquo;dhave me hold on upon haunches of plank without pad or cushion of any sort!Gad, I have no notion of bruising myself to get rid of anyone&rsquo;sbeard; let each one shave himself as best he can; I&rsquo;m not going toaccompany my master on any such long journey; besides, I can&rsquo;t giveany help to the shaving of these beards as I can to the disenchantment ofmy lady Dulcinea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you can, my friend,&rdquo; replied the Trifaldi; &ldquo;and somuch, that without you, so I understand, we shall be able to do nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the king&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; exclaimed Sancho, &ldquo;what havesquires got to do with the adventures of their masters? Are they to havethe fame of such as they go through, and we the labour? Body o&rsquo; me!if the historians would only say, &lsquo;Such and such a knight finishedsuch and such an adventure, but with the help of so and so, his squire,without which it would have been impossible for him to accomplish it;&rsquo;but they write curtly, &ldquo;Don Paralipomenon of the Three Starsaccomplished the adventure of the six monsters;&rsquo; without mentioningsuch a person as his squire, who was there all the time, just as if therewas no such being. Once more, sirs, I say my master may go alone, and muchgood may it do him; and I&rsquo;ll stay here in the company of my lady theduchess; and maybe when he comes back, he will find the lady Dulcinea&rsquo;saffair ever so much advanced; for I mean in leisure hours, and at idlemoments, to give myself a spell of whipping without so much as a hair tocover me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that you must go if it be necessary, my good Sancho,&rdquo;said the duchess, &ldquo;for they are worthy folk who ask you; and thefaces of these ladies must not remain overgrown in this way because ofyour idle fears; that would be a hard case indeed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the king&rsquo;s name, once more!&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;Ifthis charitable work were to be done for the sake of damsels inconfinement or charity-girls, a man might expose himself to somehardships; but to bear it for the sake of stripping beards off duennas!Devil take it! I&rsquo;d sooner see them all bearded, from the highest tothe lowest, and from the most prudish to the most affected.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are very hard on duennas, Sancho my friend,&rdquo; said theduchess; &ldquo;you incline very much to the opinion of the Toledoapothecary. But indeed you are wrong; there are duennas in my house thatmay serve as patterns of duennas; and here is my Doña Rodriguez, who willnot allow me to say otherwise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your excellence may say it if you like,&rdquo; said the Rodriguez;&ldquo;for God knows the truth of everything; and whether we duennas aregood or bad, bearded or smooth, we are our mothers&rsquo; daughters likeother women; and as God sent us into the world, he knows why he did, andon his mercy I rely, and not on anybody&rsquo;s beard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Señora Rodriguez, Señora Trifaldi, and present company,&rdquo;said Don Quixote, &ldquo;I trust in Heaven that it will look with kindlyeyes upon your troubles, for Sancho will do as I bid him. Only letClavileño come and let me find myself face to face with Malambruno, and Iam certain no razor will shave you more easily than my sword shall shaveMalambruno&rsquo;s head off his shoulders; for &lsquo;God bears with thewicked, but not for ever.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the Distressed One at this, &ldquo;may all thestars of the celestial regions look down upon your greatness with benigneyes, valiant knight, and shed every prosperity and valour upon yourheart, that it may be the shield and safeguard of the abused anddowntrodden race of duennas, detested by apothecaries, sneered at bysquires, and made game of by pages. Ill betide the jade that in the flowerof her youth would not sooner become a nun than a duenna! Unfortunatebeings that we are, we duennas! Though we may be descended in the directmale line from Hector of Troy himself, our mistresses never fail toaddress us as &lsquo;you&rsquo; if they think it makes queens of them. Ogiant Malambruno, though thou art an enchanter, thou art true to thypromises. Send us now the peerless Clavileño, that our misfortune may bebrought to an end; for if the hot weather sets in and these beards of oursare still there, alas for our lot!&rdquo;</p><p>The Trifaldi said this in such a pathetic way that she drew tears from theeyes of all and even Sancho&rsquo;s filled up; and he resolved in hisheart to accompany his master to the uttermost ends of the earth, if so bethe removal of the wool from those venerable countenances depended uponit.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p40e" id="p40e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p40e.jpg (13K)" src="images/p40e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch41b" id="ch41b"></a>CHAPTER XLI.<br/>OF THE ARRIVAL OF CLAVILEÑO AND THE END OF THIS PROTRACTED ADVENTURE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p41a" id="p41a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p41a.jpg (138K)" src="images/p41a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p41a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>And now night came, and with it the appointed time for the arrival of thefamous horse Clavileño, the non-appearance of which was already beginningto make Don Quixote uneasy, for it struck him that, as Malambruno was solong about sending it, either he himself was not the knight for whom theadventure was reserved, or else Malambruno did not dare to meet him insingle combat. But lo! suddenly there came into the garden four wild-menall clad in green ivy bearing on their shoulders a great wooden horse.They placed it on its feet on the ground, and one of the wild-men said,&ldquo;Let the knight who has heart for it mount this machine.&rdquo;</p><p>Here Sancho exclaimed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mount, for neither have I theheart nor am I a knight.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And let the squire, if he has one,&rdquo; continued the wild-man,&ldquo;take his seat on the croup, and let him trust the valiantMalambruno; for by no sword save his, nor by the malice of any other,shall he be assailed. It is but to turn this peg the horse has in hisneck, and he will bear them through the air to where Malambruno awaitsthem; but lest the vast elevation of their course should make them giddy,their eyes must be covered until the horse neighs, which will be the signof their having completed their journey.&rdquo;</p><p>With these words, leaving Clavileño behind them, they retired with easydignity the way they came. As soon as the Distressed One saw the horse,almost in tears she exclaimed to Don Quixote, &ldquo;Valiant knight, thepromise of Malambruno has proved trustworthy; the horse has come, ourbeards are growing, and by every hair in them all of us implore thee toshave and shear us, as it is only mounting him with thy squire and makinga happy beginning with your new journey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I will, Señora Countess Trifaldi,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;most gladly and with right goodwill, without stopping to take acushion or put on my spurs, so as not to lose time, such is my desire tosee you and all these duennas shaved clean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;with good-will orbad-will, or any way at all; and if this shaving can&rsquo;t be donewithout my mounting on the croup, my master had better look out foranother squire to go with him, and these ladies for some other way ofmaking their faces smooth; I&rsquo;m no witch to have a taste fortravelling through the air. What would my islanders say when they heardtheir governor was going, strolling about on the winds? And another thing,as it is three thousand and odd leagues from this to Kandy, if the horsetires, or the giant takes huff, we&rsquo;ll be half a dozen years gettingback, and there won&rsquo;t be isle or island in the world that will knowme: and so, as it is a common saying &lsquo;in delay there&rsquo;s danger,&rsquo;and &lsquo;when they offer thee a heifer run with a halter,&rsquo; theseladies&rsquo; beards must excuse me; &lsquo;Saint Peter is very well inRome;&rsquo; I mean I am very well in this house where so much is made ofme, and I hope for such a good thing from the master as to see myself agovernor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Friend Sancho,&rdquo; said the duke at this, &ldquo;the island thatI have promised you is not a moving one, or one that will run away; it hasroots so deeply buried in the bowels of the earth that it will be no easymatter to pluck it up or shift it from where it is; you know as well as Ido that there is no sort of office of any importance that is not obtainedby a bribe of some kind, great or small; well then, that which I look toreceive for this government is that you go with your master Don Quixote,and bring this memorable adventure to a conclusion; and whether you returnon Clavileño as quickly as his speed seems to promise, or adverse fortunebrings you back on foot travelling as a pilgrim from hostel to hostel andfrom inn to inn, you will always find your island on your return where youleft it, and your islanders with the same eagerness they have always hadto receive you as their governor, and my good-will will remain the same;doubt not the truth of this, Señor Sancho, for that would be grievouslywronging my disposition to serve you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say no more, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I am a poor squireand not equal to carrying so much courtesy; let my master mount; bandagemy eyes and commit me to God&rsquo;s care, and tell me if I may commendmyself to our Lord or call upon the angels to protect me when we gotowering up there.&rdquo;</p><p>To this the Trifaldi made answer, &ldquo;Sancho, you may freely commendyourself to God or whom you will; for Malambruno though an enchanter is aChristian, and works his enchantments with great circumspection, takingvery good care not to fall out with anyone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;God and the most holy Trinityof Gaeta give me help!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Since the memorable adventure of the fulling mills,&rdquo; said DonQuixote, &ldquo;I have never seen Sancho in such a fright as now; were Ias superstitious as others his abject fear would cause me some littletrepidation of spirit. But come here, Sancho, for with the leave of thesegentles I would say a word or two to thee in private;&rdquo; and drawingSancho aside among the trees of the garden and seizing both his hands hesaid, &ldquo;Thou seest, brother Sancho, the long journey we have beforeus, and God knows when we shall return, or what leisure or opportunitiesthis business will allow us; I wish thee therefore to retire now to thychamber, as though thou wert going to fetch something required for theroad, and in a trice give thyself if it be only five hundred lashes onaccount of the three thousand three hundred to which thou art bound; itwill be all to the good, and to make a beginning with a thing is to haveit half finished.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but your worship must be out ofyour senses! This is like the common saying, &lsquo;You see me with child,and you want me a virgin.&rsquo; Just as I&rsquo;m about to go sitting ona bare board, your worship would have me score my backside! Indeed, yourworship is not reasonable. Let us be off to shave these duennas; and onour return I promise on my word to make such haste to wipe off all that&rsquo;sdue as will satisfy your worship; I can&rsquo;t say more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I will comfort myself with that promise, my good Sancho,&rdquo;replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;and I believe thou wilt keep it; for indeedthough stupid thou art veracious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not voracious,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;only peckish;but even if I was a little, still I&rsquo;d keep my word.&rdquo;</p><p>With this they went back to mount Clavileño, and as they were about to doso Don Quixote said, &ldquo;Cover thine eyes, Sancho, and mount; for onewho sends for us from lands so far distant cannot mean to deceive us forthe sake of the paltry glory to be derived from deceiving persons whotrust in him; though all should turn out the contrary of what I hope, nomalice will be able to dim the glory of having undertaken this exploit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us be off, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for I have takenthe beards and tears of these ladies deeply to heart, and I shan&rsquo;teat a bit to relish it until I have seen them restored to their formersmoothness. Mount, your worship, and blindfold yourself, for if I am to goon the croup, it is plain the rider in the saddle must mount first.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, and, taking a handkerchiefout of his pocket, he begged the Distressed One to bandage his eyes verycarefully; but after having them bandaged he uncovered them again, saying,&ldquo;If my memory does not deceive me, I have read in Virgil of thePalladium of Troy, a wooden horse the Greeks offered to the goddessPallas, which was big with armed knights, who were afterwards thedestruction of Troy; so it would be as well to see, first of all, whatClavileño has in his stomach.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no occasion,&rdquo; said the Distressed One; &ldquo;I willbe bail for him, and I know that Malambruno has nothing tricky ortreacherous about him; you may mount without any fear, Señor Don Quixote;on my head be it if any harm befalls you.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote thought that to say anything further with regard to his safetywould be putting his courage in an unfavourable light; and so, withoutmore words, he mounted Clavileño, and tried the peg, which turned easily;and as he had no stirrups and his legs hung down, he looked like nothingso much as a figure in some Roman triumph painted or embroidered on aFlemish tapestry.</p><p>Much against the grain, and very slowly, Sancho proceeded to mount, and,after settling himself as well as he could on the croup, found it ratherhard, and not at all soft, and asked the duke if it would be possible tooblige him with a pad of some kind, or a cushion; even if it were off thecouch of his lady the duchess, or the bed of one of the pages; as thehaunches of that horse were more like marble than wood. On this theTrifaldi observed that Clavileño would not bear any kind of harness ortrappings, and that his best plan would be to sit sideways like a woman,as in that way he would not feel the hardness so much.</p><p>Sancho did so, and, bidding them farewell, allowed his eyes to bebandaged, but immediately afterwards uncovered them again, and lookingtenderly and tearfully on those in the garden, bade them help him in hispresent strait with plenty of Paternosters and Ave Marias, that God mightprovide someone to say as many for them, whenever they found themselvesin a similar emergency.</p><p>At this Don Quixote exclaimed, &ldquo;Art thou on the gallows, thief, orat thy last moment, to use pitiful entreaties of that sort? Cowardly,spiritless creature, art thou not in the very place the fair Magalonaoccupied, and from which she descended, not into the grave, but to becomeQueen of France; unless the histories lie? And I who am here beside thee,may I not put myself on a par with the valiant Pierres, who pressed thisvery spot that I now press? Cover thine eyes, cover thine eyes, abjectanimal, and let not thy fear escape thy lips, at least in my presence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Blindfold me,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;as you won&rsquo;t let mecommend myself or be commended to God, is it any wonder if I am afraidthere is a region of devils about here that will carry us off toPeralvillo?&rdquo;</p><p>They were then blindfolded, and Don Quixote, finding himself settled tohis satisfaction, felt for the peg, and the instant he placed his fingerson it, all the duennas and all who stood by lifted up their voicesexclaiming, &ldquo;God guide thee, valiant knight! God be with thee,intrepid squire! Now, now ye go cleaving the air more swiftly than anarrow! Now ye begin to amaze and astonish all who are gazing at you fromthe earth! Take care not to wobble about, valiant Sancho! Mind thou fallnot, for thy fall will be worse than that rash youth&rsquo;s who tried tosteer the chariot of his father the Sun!&rdquo;</p><p>As Sancho heard the voices, clinging tightly to his master and winding hisarms round him, he said, &ldquo;Señor, how do they make out we are goingup so high, if their voices reach us here and they seem to be speakingquite close to us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind that, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;foras affairs of this sort, and flights like this are out of the commoncourse of things, you can see and hear as much as you like a thousandleagues off; but don&rsquo;t squeeze me so tight or thou wilt upset me;and really I know not what thou hast to be uneasy or frightened at, for Ican safely swear I never mounted a smoother-going steed all the days of mylife; one would fancy we never stirred from one place. Banish fear, myfriend, for indeed everything is going as it ought, and we have the windastern.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for such a strongwind comes against me on this side, that it seems as if people wereblowing on me with a thousand pair of bellows;&rdquo; which was the case;they were puffing at him with a great pair of bellows; for the wholeadventure was so well planned by the duke, the duchess, and theirmajordomo, that nothing was omitted to make it perfectly successful.</p><p>Don Quixote now, feeling the blast, said, &ldquo;Beyond a doubt, Sancho,we must have already reached the second region of the air, where the hailand snow are generated; the thunder, the lightning, and the thunderboltsare engendered in the third region, and if we go on ascending at thisrate, we shall shortly plunge into the region of fire, and I know not howto regulate this peg, so as not to mount up where we shall be burned.&rdquo;</p><p>And now they began to warm their faces, from a distance, with tow thatcould be easily set on fire and extinguished again, fixed on the end of acane. On feeling the heat Sancho said, &ldquo;May I die if we are notalready in that fire place, or very near it, for a good part of my beardhas been singed, and I have a mind, señor, to uncover and see whereaboutswe are.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;rememberthe true story of the licentiate Torralva that the devils carried flyingthrough the air riding on a stick with his eyes shut; who in twelve hoursreached Rome and dismounted at Torre di Nona, which is a street of thecity, and saw the whole sack and storming and the death of Bourbon, andwas back in Madrid the next morning, where he gave an account of all hehad seen; and he said moreover that as he was going through the air, thedevil bade him open his eyes, and he did so, and saw himself so near thebody of the moon, so it seemed to him, that he could have laid hold of itwith his hand, and that he did not dare to look at the earth lest heshould be seized with giddiness. So that, Sancho, it will not do for us touncover ourselves, for he who has us in charge will be responsible for us;and perhaps we are gaining an altitude and mounting up to enable us todescend at one swoop on the kingdom of Kandy, as the saker or falcon doeson the heron, so as to seize it however high it may soar; and though itseems to us not half an hour since we left the garden, believe me we musthave travelled a great distance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how that may be,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;allI know is that if the Señora Magallanes or Magalona was satisfied withthis croup, she could not have been very tender of flesh.&rdquo;</p><p>The duke, the duchess, and all in the garden were listening to theconversation of the two heroes, and were beyond measure amused by it; andnow, desirous of putting a finishing touch to this rare and well-contrivedadventure, they applied a light to Clavileño&rsquo;s tail with some tow,and the horse, being full of squibs and crackers, immediately blew up witha prodigious noise, and brought Don Quixote and Sancho Panza to the groundhalf singed. By this time the bearded band of duennas, the Trifaldi andall, had vanished from the garden, and those that remained lay stretchedon the ground as if in a swoon. Don Quixote and Sancho got up rathershaken, and, looking about them, were filled with amazement at findingthemselves in the same garden from which they had started, and seeing sucha number of people stretched on the ground; and their astonishment wasincreased when at one side of the garden they perceived a tall lanceplanted in the ground, and hanging from it by two cords of green silk asmooth white parchment on which there was the following inscription inlarge gold letters: &ldquo;The illustrious knight Don Quixote of La Manchahas, by merely attempting it, finished and concluded the adventure of theCountess Trifaldi, otherwise called the Distressed Duenna; Malambruno isnow satisfied on every point, the chins of the duennas are now smooth andclean, and King Don Clavijo and Queen Antonomasia in their original form;and when the squirely flagellation shall have been completed, the whitedove shall find herself delivered from the pestiferous gerfalcons thatpersecute her, and in the arms of her beloved mate; for such is the decreeof the sage Merlin, arch-enchanter of enchanters.&rdquo;</p><p>As soon as Don Quixote had read the inscription on the parchment heperceived clearly that it referred to the disenchantment of Dulcinea, andreturning hearty thanks to heaven that he had with so little dangerachieved so grand an exploit as to restore to their former complexion thecountenances of those venerable duennas, he advanced towards the duke andduchess, who had not yet come to themselves, and taking the duke by thehand he said, &ldquo;Be of good cheer, worthy sir, be of good cheer; it&rsquo;snothing at all; the adventure is now over and without any harm done, asthe inscription fixed on this post shows plainly.&rdquo;</p><p>The duke came to himself slowly and like one recovering consciousnessafter a heavy sleep, and the duchess and all who had fallen prostrateabout the garden did the same, with such demonstrations of wonder andamazement that they would have almost persuaded one that what theypretended so adroitly in jest had happened to them in reality. The dukeread the placard with half-shut eyes, and then ran to embrace Don Quixotewith open arms, declaring him to be the best knight that had ever beenseen in any age. Sancho kept looking about for the Distressed One, to seewhat her face was like without the beard, and if she was as fair as herelegant person promised; but they told him that, the instant Clavileñodescended flaming through the air and came to the ground, the whole bandof duennas with the Trifaldi vanished, and that they were already shavedand without a stump left.</p><p>The duchess asked Sancho how he had fared on that long journey, to whichSancho replied, &ldquo;I felt, señora, that we were flying through theregion of fire, as my master told me, and I wanted to uncover my eyes fora bit; but my master, when I asked leave to uncover myself, would not letme; but as I have a little bit of curiosity about me, and a desire to knowwhat is forbidden and kept from me, quietly and without anyone seeing me Idrew aside the handkerchief covering my eyes ever so little, close to mynose, and from underneath looked towards the earth, and it seemed to methat it was altogether no bigger than a grain of mustard seed, and thatthe men walking on it were little bigger than hazel nuts; so you may seehow high we must have got to then.&rdquo;</p><p>To this the duchess said, &ldquo;Sancho, my friend, mind what you aresaying; it seems you could not have seen the earth, but only the menwalking on it; for if the earth looked to you like a grain of mustardseed, and each man like a hazel nut, one man alone would have covered thewhole earth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but for all that I got aglimpse of a bit of one side of it, and saw it all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take care, Sancho,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;with a bit ofone side one does not see the whole of what one looks at.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that way of looking at things,&rdquo; saidSancho; &ldquo;I only know that your ladyship will do well to bear in mindthat as we were flying by enchantment so I might have seen the whole earthand all the men by enchantment whatever way I looked; and if you won&rsquo;tbelieve this, no more will you believe that, uncovering myself nearly tothe eyebrows, I saw myself so close to the sky that there was not a palmand a half between me and it; and by everything that I can swear by,señora, it is mighty great! And it so happened we came by where the sevengoats are, and by God and upon my soul, as in my youth I was a goatherd inmy own country, as soon as I saw them I felt a longing to be among themfor a little, and if I had not given way to it I think I&rsquo;d haveburst. So I come and take, and what do I do? without saying anything toanybody, not even to my master, softly and quietly I got down fromClavileño and amused myself with the goats&mdash;which are like violets,like flowers&mdash;for nigh three-quarters of an hour; and Clavileño neverstirred or moved from one spot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And while the good Sancho was amusing himself with the goats,&rdquo;said the duke, &ldquo;how did Señor Don Quixote amuse himself?&rdquo;</p><p>To which Don Quixote replied, &ldquo;As all these things and such likeoccurrences are out of the ordinary course of nature, it is no wonder thatSancho says what he does; for my own part I can only say that I did notuncover my eyes either above or below, nor did I see sky or earth or seaor shore. It is true I felt that I was passing through the region of theair, and even that I touched that of fire; but that we passed farther Icannot believe; for the region of fire being between the heaven of themoon and the last region of the air, we could not have reached that heavenwhere the seven goats Sancho speaks of are without being burned; and as wewere not burned, either Sancho is lying or Sancho is dreaming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am neither lying nor dreaming,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;onlyask me the tokens of those same goats, and you&rsquo;ll see by thatwhether I&rsquo;m telling the truth or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell us them then, Sancho,&rdquo; said the duchess.</p><p>&ldquo;Two of them,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;are green, two blood-red,two blue, and one a mixture of all colours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;An odd sort of goat, that,&rdquo; said the duke; &ldquo;in thisearthly region of ours we have no such colours; I mean goats of suchcolours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very plain,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;of course theremust be a difference between the goats of heaven and the goats of theearth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, Sancho,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;did you see anyhe-goat among those goats?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;but I have heard say thatnone ever passed the horns of the moon.&rdquo;</p><p>They did not care to ask him anything more about his journey, for they sawhe was in the vein to go rambling all over the heavens giving an accountof everything that went on there, without having ever stirred from thegarden. Such, in short, was the end of the adventure of the DistressedDuenna, which gave the duke and duchess laughing matter not only for thetime being, but for all their lives, and Sancho something to talk aboutfor ages, if he lived so long; but Don Quixote, coming close to his ear,said to him, &ldquo;Sancho, as you would have us believe what you saw inheaven, I require you to believe me as to what I saw in the cave ofMontesinos; I say no more.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p41e" id="p41e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p41e.jpg (38K)" src="images/p41e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch42b" id="ch42b"></a>CHAPTER XLII.<br/>OF THE COUNSELS WHICH DON QUIXOTE GAVE SANCHO PANZA BEFORE HE SET OUT TOGOVERN THE ISLAND, TOGETHER WITH OTHER WELL-CONSIDERED MATTERS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p42a" id="p42a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p42a.jpg (120K)" src="images/p42a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p42a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The duke and duchess were so well pleased with the successful and drollresult of the adventure of the Distressed One, that they resolved to carryon the joke, seeing what a fit subject they had to deal with for making itall pass for reality. So having laid their plans and given instructions totheir servants and vassals how to behave to Sancho in his government ofthe promised island, the next day, that following Clavileño&rsquo;sflight, the duke told Sancho to prepare and get ready to go and begovernor, for his islanders were already looking out for him as for theshowers of May.</p><p>Sancho made him an obeisance, and said, &ldquo;Ever since I came down fromheaven, and from the top of it beheld the earth, and saw how little it is,the great desire I had to be a governor has been partly cooled in me; forwhat is there grand in being ruler on a grain of mustard seed, or whatdignity or authority in governing half a dozen men about as big as hazelnuts; for, so far as I could see, there were no more on the whole earth?If your lordship would be so good as to give me ever so small a bit ofheaven, were it no more than half a league, I&rsquo;d rather have it thanthe best island in the world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Recollect, Sancho,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;I cannot give a bitof heaven, no not so much as the breadth of my nail, to anyone; rewardsand favours of that sort are reserved for God alone. What I can give Igive you, and that is a real, genuine island, compact, well proportioned,and uncommonly fertile and fruitful, where, if you know how to use youropportunities, you may, with the help of the world&rsquo;s riches, gainthose of heaven.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;let the island come; and I&rsquo;lltry and be such a governor, that in spite of scoundrels I&rsquo;ll go toheaven; and it&rsquo;s not from any craving to quit my own humblecondition or better myself, but from the desire I have to try what ittastes like to be a governor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you once make trial of it, Sancho,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;you&rsquo;lleat your fingers off after the government, so sweet a thing is it tocommand and be obeyed. Depend upon it when your master comes to be emperor(as he will beyond a doubt from the course his affairs are taking), itwill be no easy matter to wrest the dignity from him, and he will be soreand sorry at heart to have been so long without becoming one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;it is my belief it&rsquo;s a goodthing to be in command, if it&rsquo;s only over a drove of cattle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May I be buried with you, Sancho,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;butyou know everything; I hope you will make as good a governor as yoursagacity promises; and that is all I have to say; and now rememberto-morrow is the day you must set out for the government of the island,and this evening they will provide you with the proper attire for you towear, and all things requisite for your departure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let them dress me as they like,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;howeverI&rsquo;m dressed I&rsquo;ll be Sancho Panza.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said the duke; &ldquo;but one&rsquo;sdress must be suited to the office or rank one holds; for it would not dofor a jurist to dress like a soldier, or a soldier like a priest. You,Sancho, shall go partly as a lawyer, partly as a captain, for, in theisland I am giving you, arms are needed as much as letters, and letters asmuch as arms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of letters I know but little,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for I don&rsquo;teven know the A B C; but it is enough for me to have the Christus in mymemory to be a good governor. As for arms, I&rsquo;ll handle those theygive me till I drop, and then, God be my help!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With so good a memory,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;Sancho cannotgo wrong in anything.&rdquo;</p><p>Here Don Quixote joined them; and learning what passed, and how soonSancho was to go to his government, he with the duke&rsquo;s permissiontook him by the hand, and retired to his room with him for the purpose ofgiving him advice as to how he was to demean himself in his office. Assoon as they had entered the chamber he closed the door after him, andalmost by force made Sancho sit down beside him, and in a quiet tone thusaddressed him: &ldquo;I give infinite thanks to heaven, friend Sancho,that, before I have met with any good luck, fortune has come forward tomeet thee. I who counted upon my good fortune to discharge the recompenseof thy services, find myself still waiting for advancement, while thou,before the time, and contrary to all reasonable expectation, seest thyselfblessed in the fulfillment of thy desires. Some will bribe, beg, solicit,rise early, entreat, persist, without attaining the object of their suit;while another comes, and without knowing why or wherefore, finds himselfinvested with the place or office so many have sued for; and here it isthat the common saying, &lsquo;There is good luck as well as bad luck insuits,&rsquo; applies. Thou, who, to my thinking, art beyond all doubt adullard, without early rising or night watching or taking any trouble,with the mere breath of knight-errantry that has breathed upon thee, seestthyself without more ado governor of an island, as though it were a merematter of course. This I say, Sancho, that thou attribute not the favourthou hast received to thine own merits, but give thanks to heaven thatdisposes matters beneficently, and secondly thanks to the great power theprofession of knight-errantry contains in itself. With a heart, then,inclined to believe what I have said to thee, attend, my son, to thy Catohere who would counsel thee and be thy polestar and guide to direct andpilot thee to a safe haven out of this stormy sea wherein thou art aboutto ingulf thyself; for offices and great trusts are nothing else but amighty gulf of troubles.</p><p>&ldquo;First of all, my son, thou must fear God, for in the fear of him iswisdom, and being wise thou canst not err in aught.</p><p>&ldquo;Secondly, thou must keep in view what thou art, striving to knowthyself, the most difficult thing to know that the mind can imagine. Ifthou knowest thyself, it will follow thou wilt not puff thyself up likethe frog that strove to make himself as large as the ox; if thou dost, therecollection of having kept pigs in thine own country will serve as theugly feet for the wheel of thy folly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;but that waswhen I was a boy; afterwards when I was something more of a man it wasgeese I kept, not pigs. But to my thinking that has nothing to do with it;for all who are governors don&rsquo;t come of a kingly stock.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and for that reason those whoare not of noble origin should take care that the dignity of the officethey hold be accompanied by a gentle suavity, which wisely managed willsave them from the sneers of malice that no station escapes.</p><p>&ldquo;Glory in thy humble birth, Sancho, and be not ashamed of sayingthou art peasant-born; for when it is seen thou art not ashamed no onewill set himself to put thee to the blush; and pride thyself rather uponbeing one of lowly virtue than a lofty sinner. Countless are they who,born of mean parentage, have risen to the highest dignities, pontificaland imperial, and of the truth of this I could give thee instances enoughto weary thee.</p><p>&ldquo;Remember, Sancho, if thou make virtue thy aim, and take a pride indoing virtuous actions, thou wilt have no cause to envy those who haveprincely and lordly ones, for blood is an inheritance, but virtue anacquisition, and virtue has in itself alone a worth that blood does notpossess.</p><p>&ldquo;This being so, if perchance anyone of thy kinsfolk should come tosee thee when thou art in thine island, thou art not to repel or slighthim, but on the contrary to welcome him, entertain him, and make much ofhim; for in so doing thou wilt be approved of heaven (which is not pleasedthat any should despise what it hath made), and wilt comply with the lawsof well-ordered nature.</p><p>&ldquo;If thou carriest thy wife with thee (and it is not well for thosethat administer governments to be long without their wives), teach andinstruct her, and strive to smooth down her natural roughness; for allthat may be gained by a wise governor may be lost and wasted by a boorishstupid wife.</p><p>&ldquo;If perchance thou art left a widower&mdash;a thing which may happen&mdash;andin virtue of thy office seekest a consort of higher degree, choose not oneto serve thee for a hook, or for a fishing-rod, or for the hood of thy&lsquo;won&rsquo;t have it;&rsquo; for verily, I tell thee, for all thejudge&rsquo;s wife receives, the husband will be held accountable at thegeneral calling to account; where he will have repay in death fourfold,items that in life he regarded as naught.</p><p>&ldquo;Never go by arbitrary law, which is so much favoured by ignorantmen who plume themselves on cleverness.</p><p>&ldquo;Let the tears of the poor man find with thee more compassion, butnot more justice, than the pleadings of the rich.</p><p>&ldquo;Strive to lay bare the truth, as well amid the promises andpresents of the rich man, as amid the sobs and entreaties of the poor.</p><p>&ldquo;When equity may and should be brought into play, press not theutmost rigour of the law against the guilty; for the reputation of thestern judge stands not higher than that of the compassionate.</p><p>&ldquo;If perchance thou permittest the staff of justice to swerve, let itbe not by the weight of a gift, but by that of mercy.</p><p>&ldquo;If it should happen to thee to give judgment in the cause of onewho is thine enemy, turn thy thoughts away from thy injury and fix them onthe justice of the case.</p><p>&ldquo;Let not thine own passion blind thee in another man&rsquo;s cause;for the errors thou wilt thus commit will be most frequently irremediable;or if not, only to be remedied at the expense of thy good name and even ofthy fortune.</p><p>&ldquo;If any handsome woman come to seek justice of thee, turn away thineeyes from her tears and thine ears from her lamentations, and considerdeliberately the merits of her demand, if thou wouldst not have thy reasonswept away by her weeping, and thy rectitude by her sighs.</p><p>&ldquo;Abuse not by word him whom thou hast to punish in deed, for thepain of punishment is enough for the unfortunate without the addition ofthine objurgations.</p><p>&ldquo;Bear in mind that the culprit who comes under thy jurisdiction isbut a miserable man subject to all the propensities of our depravednature, and so far as may be in thy power show thyself lenient andforbearing; for though the attributes of God are all equal, to our eyesthat of mercy is brighter and loftier than that of justice.</p><p>&ldquo;If thou followest these precepts and rules, Sancho, thy days willbe long, thy fame eternal, thy reward abundant, thy felicity unutterable;thou wilt marry thy children as thou wouldst; they and thy grandchildrenwill bear titles; thou wilt live in peace and concord with all men; and,when life draws to a close, death will come to thee in calm and ripe oldage, and the light and loving hands of thy great-grandchildren will closethine eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;What I have thus far addressed to thee are instructions for theadornment of thy mind; listen now to those which tend to that of the body.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p42e" id="p42e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p42e.jpg (17K)" src="images/p42e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch43b" id="ch43b"></a>CHAPTER XLIII.<br/>OF THE SECOND SET OF COUNSELS DON QUIXOTE GAVE SANCHO PANZA</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p43a" id="p43a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p43a.jpg (129K)" src="images/p43a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p43a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Who, hearing the foregoing discourse of Don Quixote, would not have sethim down for a person of great good sense and greater rectitude ofpurpose? But, as has been frequently observed in the course of this greathistory, he only talked nonsense when he touched on chivalry, and indiscussing all other subjects showed that he had a clear and unbiassedunderstanding; so that at every turn his acts gave the lie to hisintellect, and his intellect to his acts; but in the case of these secondcounsels that he gave Sancho, he showed himself to have a lively turn ofhumour, and displayed conspicuously his wisdom, and also his folly.</p><p>Sancho listened to him with the deepest attention, and endeavoured to fixhis counsels in his memory, like one who meant to follow them and by theirmeans bring the full promise of his government to a happy issue. DonQuixote, then, went on to say:</p><p>&ldquo;With regard to the mode in which thou shouldst govern thy personand thy house, Sancho, the first charge I have to give thee is to beclean, and to cut thy nails, not letting them grow as some do, whoseignorance makes them fancy that long nails are an ornament to their hands,as if those excrescences they neglect to cut were nails, and not thetalons of a lizard-catching kestrel&mdash;a filthy and unnatural abuse.</p><p>&ldquo;Go not ungirt and loose, Sancho; for disordered attire is a sign ofan unstable mind, unless indeed the slovenliness and slackness is to beset down to craft, as was the common opinion in the case of Julius Cæsar.</p><p>&ldquo;Ascertain cautiously what thy office may be worth; and if it willallow thee to give liveries to thy servants, give them respectable andserviceable, rather than showy and gay ones, and divide them between thyservants and the poor; that is to say, if thou canst clothe six pages,clothe three and three poor men, and thus thou wilt have pages for heavenand pages for earth; the vainglorious never think of this new mode ofgiving liveries.</p><p>&ldquo;Eat not garlic nor onions, lest they find out thy boorish origin bythe smell; walk slowly and speak deliberately, but not in such a way as tomake it seem thou art listening to thyself, for all affectation is bad.</p><p>&ldquo;Dine sparingly and sup more sparingly still; for the health of thewhole body is forged in the workshop of the stomach.</p><p>&ldquo;Be temperate in drinking, bearing in mind that wine in excess keepsneither secrets nor promises.</p><p>&ldquo;Take care, Sancho, not to chew on both sides, and not to eruct inanybody&rsquo;s presence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eruct!&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what thatmeans.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To eruct, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;means to belch,and that is one of the filthiest words in the Spanish language, though avery expressive one; and therefore nice folk have had recourse to theLatin, and instead of belch say eruct, and instead of belches sayeructations; and if some do not understand these terms it matters little,for custom will bring them into use in the course of time, so that theywill be readily understood; this is the way a language is enriched; customand the public are all-powerful there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In truth, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;one of the counsels andcautions I mean to bear in mind shall be this, not to belch, for I&rsquo;mconstantly doing it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eruct, Sancho, not belch,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Eruct, I shall say henceforth, and I swear not to forget it,&rdquo;said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Likewise, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;thou must notmingle such a quantity of proverbs in thy discourse as thou dost; forthough proverbs are short maxims, thou dost drag them in so often by thehead and shoulders that they savour more of nonsense than of maxims.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God alone can cure that,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;for I have moreproverbs in me than a book, and when I speak they come so thick togetherinto my mouth that they fall to fighting among themselves to get out; that&rsquo;swhy my tongue lets fly the first that come, though they may not be pat tothe purpose. But I&rsquo;ll take care henceforward to use such as befitthe dignity of my office; for &lsquo;in a house where there&rsquo;splenty, supper is soon cooked,&rsquo; and &lsquo;he who binds does notwrangle,&rsquo; and &lsquo;the bell-ringer&rsquo;s in a safe berth,&rsquo;and &lsquo;giving and keeping require brains.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Sancho!&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;pack,tack, string proverbs together; nobody is hindering thee! &lsquo;My motherbeats me, and I go on with my tricks.&rsquo; I am bidding thee avoidproverbs, and here in a second thou hast shot out a whole litany of them,which have as much to do with what we are talking about as &lsquo;over thehills of Úbeda.&rsquo; Mind, Sancho, I do not say that a proverb aptlybrought in is objectionable; but to pile up and string together proverbsat random makes conversation dull and vulgar.</p><p>&ldquo;When thou ridest on horseback, do not go lolling with thy body onthe back of the saddle, nor carry thy legs stiff or sticking out from thehorse&rsquo;s belly, nor yet sit so loosely that one would suppose thouwert on Dapple; for the seat on a horse makes gentlemen of some and groomsof others.</p><p>&ldquo;Be moderate in thy sleep; for he who does not rise early does notget the benefit of the day; and remember, Sancho, diligence is the motherof good fortune, and indolence, its opposite, never yet attained theobject of an honest ambition.</p><p>&ldquo;The last counsel I will give thee now, though it does not tend tobodily improvement, I would have thee carry carefully in thy memory, for Ibelieve it will be no less useful to thee than those I have given theealready, and it is this&mdash;never engage in a dispute about families, atleast in the way of comparing them one with another; for necessarily oneof those compared will be better than the other, and thou wilt be hated bythe one thou hast disparaged, and get nothing in any shape from the onethou hast exalted.</p><p>&ldquo;Thy attire shall be hose of full length, a long jerkin, and a cloaka trifle longer; loose breeches by no means, for they are becoming neitherfor gentlemen nor for governors.</p><p>&ldquo;For the present, Sancho, this is all that has occurred to me toadvise thee; as time goes by and occasions arise my instructions shallfollow, if thou take care to let me know how thou art circumstanced.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;I see well enough that all thesethings your worship has said to me are good, holy, and profitable; butwhat use will they be to me if I don&rsquo;t remember one of them? To besure that about not letting my nails grow, and marrying again if I havethe chance, will not slip out of my head; but all that other hash, muddle,and jumble&mdash;I don&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t recollect any more of itthan of last year&rsquo;s clouds; so it must be given me in writing; forthough I can&rsquo;t either read or write, I&rsquo;ll give it to myconfessor, to drive it into me and remind me of it whenever it isnecessary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, sinner that I am!&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;how bad itlooks in governors not to know how to read or write; for let me tell thee,Sancho, when a man knows not how to read, or is left-handed, it argues oneof two things; either that he was the son of exceedingly mean and lowlyparents, or that he himself was so incorrigible and ill-conditioned thatneither good company nor good teaching could make any impression on him.It is a great defect that thou labourest under, and therefore I would havethee learn at any rate to sign thy name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can sign my name well enough,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for when Iwas steward of the brotherhood in my village I learned to make certain letters,like the marks on bales of goods, which they told me made out my name. BesidesI can pretend my right hand is disabled and make someone else sign for me, for&lsquo;there&rsquo;s a remedy for everything except death;&rsquo; and as Ishall be in command and hold the staff, I can do as I like; moreover, &lsquo;hewho has the alcalde for his father&mdash;,&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ll be governor,and that&rsquo;s higher than alcalde. Only come and see! Let them make light ofme and abuse me; &lsquo;they&rsquo;ll come for wool and go back shorn;&rsquo;&lsquo;whom God loves, his house is known to Him;&rsquo; &lsquo;the sillysayings of the rich pass for saws in the world;&rsquo; and as I&rsquo;ll berich, being a governor, and at the same time generous, as I mean to be, nofault will be seen in me. &lsquo;Only make yourself honey and the flies willsuck you;&rsquo; &lsquo;as much as thou hast so much art thou worth,&rsquo; asmy grandmother used to say; and &lsquo;thou canst have no revenge of a man ofsubstance.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, God&rsquo;s curse upon thee, Sancho!&rdquo; here exclaimed DonQuixote; &ldquo;sixty thousand devils fly away with thee and thy proverbs!For the last hour thou hast been stringing them together and inflictingthe pangs of torture on me with every one of them. Those proverbs willbring thee to the gallows one day, I promise thee; thy subjects will takethe government from thee, or there will be revolts among them. Tell me,where dost thou pick them up, thou booby? How dost thou apply them, thoublockhead? For with me, to utter one and make it apply properly, I have tosweat and labour as if I were digging.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God, master mine,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;your worship ismaking a fuss about very little. Why the devil should you be vexed if Imake use of what is my own? And I have got nothing else, nor any otherstock in trade except proverbs and more proverbs; and here are three justthis instant come into my head, pat to the purpose and like pears in abasket; but I won&rsquo;t repeat them, for &lsquo;sage silence is calledSancho.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That, Sancho, thou art not,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;for notonly art thou not sage silence, but thou art pestilent prate andperversity; still I would like to know what three proverbs have just nowcome into thy memory, for I have been turning over mine own&mdash;and itis a good one&mdash;and none occurs to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What can be better,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;than &lsquo;neverput thy thumbs between two back teeth;&rsquo; and &lsquo;to &ldquo;<i>get outof my house</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>what do you want with my wife?</i>&rdquo; thereis no answer;&rsquo; and &lsquo;whether the pitcher hits the stone, or thestone the pitcher, it&rsquo;s a bad business for the pitcher;&rsquo; allwhich fit to a hair? For no one should quarrel with his governor, or himin authority over him, because he will come off the worst, as he does whoputs his finger between two back and if they are not back teeth it makesno difference, so long as they are teeth; and to whatever the governor maysay there&rsquo;s no answer, any more than to &lsquo;get out of my house&rsquo;and &lsquo;what do you want with my wife?&rsquo; and then, as for thatabout the stone and the pitcher, a blind man could see that. So that he&lsquo;who sees the mote in another&rsquo;s eye had need to see the beamin his own,&rsquo; that it be not said of himself, &lsquo;the dead womanwas frightened at the one with her throat cut;&rsquo; and your worshipknows well that &lsquo;the fool knows more in his own house than the wiseman in another&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nay, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;the fool knowsnothing, either in his own house or in anybody else&rsquo;s, for no wisestructure of any sort can stand on a foundation of folly; but let us sayno more about it, Sancho, for if thou governest badly, thine will be thefault and mine the shame; but I comfort myself with having done my duty inadvising thee as earnestly and as wisely as I could; and thus I amreleased from my obligations and my promise. God guide thee, Sancho, andgovern thee in thy government, and deliver me from the misgiving I havethat thou wilt turn the whole island upside down, a thing I might easilyprevent by explaining to the duke what thou art and telling him that allthat fat little person of thine is nothing else but a sack full ofproverbs and sauciness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;if your worship thinks I&rsquo;mnot fit for this government, I give it up on the spot; for the mere blackof the nail of my soul is dearer to me than my whole body; and I can livejust as well, simple Sancho, on bread and onions, as governor, onpartridges and capons; and what&rsquo;s more, while we&rsquo;re asleep we&rsquo;reall equal, great and small, rich and poor. But if your worship looks intoit, you will see it was your worship alone that put me on to this businessof governing; for I know no more about the government of islands than abuzzard; and if there&rsquo;s any reason to think that because of my beinga governor the devil will get hold of me, I&rsquo;d rather go Sancho toheaven than governor to hell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for those lastwords thou hast uttered alone, I consider thou deservest to be governor ofa thousand islands. Thou hast good natural instincts, without which noknowledge is worth anything; commend thyself to God, and try not to swervein the pursuit of thy main object; I mean, always make it thy aim andfixed purpose to do right in all matters that come before thee, for heavenalways helps good intentions; and now let us go to dinner, for I think mylord and lady are waiting for us.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p43e" id="p43e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p43e.jpg (41K)" src="images/p43e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch44b" id="ch44b"></a>CHAPTER XLIV.<br/>HOW SANCHO PANZA WAS CONDUCTED TO HIS GOVERNMENT, AND OF THE STRANGEADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE CASTLE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p44a" id="p44a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p44a.jpg (140K)" src="images/p44a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p44a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>It is stated, they say, in the true original of this history, that whenCide Hamete came to write this chapter, his interpreter did not translateit as he wrote it&mdash;that is, as a kind of complaint the Moor madeagainst himself for having taken in hand a story so dry and of so littlevariety as this of Don Quixote, for he found himself forced to speakperpetually of him and Sancho, without venturing to indulge in digressionsand episodes more serious and more interesting. He said, too, that to goon, mind, hand, pen always restricted to writing upon one single subject,and speaking through the mouths of a few characters, was intolerabledrudgery, the result of which was never equal to the author&rsquo;slabour, and that to avoid this he had in the First Part availed himself ofthe device of novels, like &ldquo;The Ill-advised Curiosity,&rdquo; and&ldquo;The Captive Captain,&rdquo; which stand, as it were, apart from thestory; the others are given there being incidents which occurred to DonQuixote himself and could not be omitted. He also thought, he says, thatmany, engrossed by the interest attaching to the exploits of Don Quixote,would take none in the novels, and pass them over hastily or impatientlywithout noticing the elegance and art of their composition, which would bevery manifest were they published by themselves and not as mere adjunctsto the crazes of Don Quixote or the simplicities of Sancho. Therefore inthis Second Part he thought it best not to insert novels, either separateor interwoven, but only episodes, something like them, arising out of thecircumstances the facts present; and even these sparingly, and with nomore words than suffice to make them plain; and as he confines andrestricts himself to the narrow limits of the narrative, though he hasability; capacity, and brains enough to deal with the whole universe, herequests that his labours may not be despised, and that credit be givenhim, not alone for what he writes, but for what he has refrained fromwriting.</p><p>And so he goes on with his story, saying that the day Don Quixote gave thecounsels to Sancho, the same afternoon after dinner he handed them to himin writing so that he might get someone to read them to him. They hadscarcely, however, been given to him when he let them drop, and they fellinto the hands of the duke, who showed them to the duchess and they wereboth amazed afresh at the madness and wit of Don Quixote. To carry on thejoke, then, the same evening they despatched Sancho with a large followingto the village that was to serve him for an island. It happened that theperson who had him in charge was a majordomo of the duke&rsquo;s, a man ofgreat discretion and humour&mdash;and there can be no humour withoutdiscretion&mdash;and the same who played the part of the Countess Trifaldiin the comical way that has been already described; and thus qualified,and instructed by his master and mistress as to how to deal with Sancho,he carried out their scheme admirably. Now it came to pass that as soon asSancho saw this majordomo he seemed in his features to recognise those ofthe Trifaldi, and turning to his master, he said to him, &ldquo;Señor,either the devil will carry me off, here on this spot, righteous andbelieving, or your worship will own to me that the face of this majordomoof the duke&rsquo;s here is the very face of the Distressed One.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote regarded the majordomo attentively, and having done so, saidto Sancho, &ldquo;There is no reason why the devil should carry thee off,Sancho, either righteous or believing&mdash;and what thou meanest by thatI know not; the face of the Distressed One is that of the majordomo, butfor all that the majordomo is not the Distressed One; for his being sowould involve a mighty contradiction; but this is not the time for goinginto questions of the sort, which would be involving ourselves in aninextricable labyrinth. Believe me, my friend, we must pray earnestly toour Lord that he deliver us both from wicked wizards and enchanters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is no joke, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for before this Iheard him speak, and it seemed exactly as if the voice of the Trifaldi wassounding in my ears. Well, I&rsquo;ll hold my peace; but I&rsquo;ll takecare to be on the look-out henceforth for any sign that may be seen toconfirm or do away with this suspicion.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou wilt do well, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and thouwilt let me know all thou discoverest, and all that befalls thee in thygovernment.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho at last set out attended by a great number of people. He wasdressed in the garb of a lawyer, with a gaban of tawny watered camlet overall and a montera cap of the same material, and mounted a la gineta upon amule. Behind him, in accordance with the duke&rsquo;s orders, followedDapple with brand new ass-trappings and ornaments of silk, and from timeto time Sancho turned round to look at his ass, so well pleased to havehim with him that he would not have changed places with the emperor ofGermany. On taking leave he kissed the hands of the duke and duchess andgot his master&rsquo;s blessing, which Don Quixote gave him with tears,and he received blubbering.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p44b" id="p44b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p44b.jpg (341K)" src="images/p44b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p44b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Let worthy Sancho go in peace, and good luck to him, Gentle Reader; andlook out for two bushels of laughter, which the account of how he behavedhimself in office will give thee. In the meantime turn thy attention towhat happened his master the same night, and if thou dost not laughthereat, at any rate thou wilt stretch thy mouth with a grin; for DonQuixote&rsquo;s adventures must be honoured either with wonder or withlaughter.</p><p>It is recorded, then, that as soon as Sancho had gone, Don Quixote felthis loneliness, and had it been possible for him to revoke the mandate andtake away the government from him he would have done so. The duchessobserved his dejection and asked him why he was melancholy; because, shesaid, if it was for the loss of Sancho, there were squires, duennas, anddamsels in her house who would wait upon him to his full satisfaction.</p><p>&ldquo;The truth is, señora,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;that I dofeel the loss of Sancho; but that is not the main cause of my looking sad;and of all the offers your excellence makes me, I accept only thegood-will with which they are made, and as to the remainder I entreat ofyour excellence to permit and allow me alone to wait upon myself in mychamber.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;thatmust not be; four of my damsels, as beautiful as flowers, shall wait uponyou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To me,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;they will not be flowers,but thorns to pierce my heart. They, or anything like them, shall as soonenter my chamber as fly. If your highness wishes to gratify me stillfurther, though I deserve it not, permit me to please myself, and waitupon myself in my own room; for I place a barrier between my inclinationsand my virtue, and I do not wish to break this rule through the generosityyour highness is disposed to display towards me; and, in short, I willsleep in my clothes, sooner than allow anyone to undress me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say no more, Señor Don Quixote, say no more,&rdquo; said theduchess; &ldquo;I assure you I will give orders that not even a fly, notto say a damsel, shall enter your room. I am not the one to undermine thepropriety of Señor Don Quixote, for it strikes me that among his manyvirtues the one that is pre-eminent is that of modesty. Your worship mayundress and dress in private and in your own way, as you please and whenyou please, for there will be no one to hinder you; and in your chamberyou will find all the utensils requisite to supply the wants of one whosleeps with his door locked, to the end that no natural needs compel youto open it. May the great Dulcinea del Toboso live a thousand years, andmay her fame extend all over the surface of the globe, for she deserves tobe loved by a knight so valiant and so virtuous; and may kind heaveninfuse zeal into the heart of our governor Sancho Panza to finish off hisdiscipline speedily, so that the world may once more enjoy the beauty ofso grand a lady.&rdquo;</p><p>To which Don Quixote replied, &ldquo;Your highness has spoken like whatyou are; from the mouth of a noble lady nothing bad can come; and Dulcineawill be more fortunate, and better known to the world by the praise ofyour highness than by all the eulogies the greatest orators on earth couldbestow upon her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, well, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; said the duchess, it isnearly supper-time, and the duke is probably waiting; come let us go tosupper, and retire to rest early, for the journey you made yesterday fromKandy was not such a short one but that it must have caused you somefatigue.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I feel none, señora,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for I would goso far as to swear to your excellence that in all my life I never mounteda quieter beast, or a pleasanter paced one, than Clavileño; and I don&rsquo;tknow what could have induced Malambruno to discard a steed so swift and sogentle, and burn it so recklessly as he did.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;repenting of the evil hehad done to the Trifaldi and company, and others, and the crimes he musthave committed as a wizard and enchanter, he resolved to make away withall the instruments of his craft; and so burned Clavileño as the chiefone, and that which mainly kept him restless, wandering from land to land;and by its ashes and the trophy of the placard the valour of the great DonQuixote of La Mancha is established for ever.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote renewed his thanks to the duchess; and having supped, retiredto his chamber alone, refusing to allow anyone to enter with him to waiton him, such was his fear of encountering temptations that might lead ordrive him to forget his chaste fidelity to his lady Dulcinea; for he hadalways present to his mind the virtue of Amadis, that flower and mirror ofknights-errant. He locked the door behind him, and by the light of two waxcandles undressed himself, but as he was taking off his stockings&mdash;Odisaster unworthy of such a personage!&mdash;there came a burst, not ofsighs, or anything belying his delicacy or good breeding, but of some twodozen stitches in one of his stockings, that made it look like awindow-lattice. The worthy gentleman was beyond measure distressed, and atthat moment he would have given an ounce of silver to have had half adrachm of green silk there; I say green silk, because the stockings weregreen.</p><p>Here Cide Hamete exclaimed as he was writing, &ldquo;O poverty, poverty! Iknow not what could have possessed the great Cordovan poet to call thee&lsquo;holy gift ungratefully received.&rsquo; Although a Moor, I knowwell enough from the intercourse I have had with Christians that holinessconsists in charity, humility, faith, obedience, and poverty; but for allthat, I say he must have a great deal of godliness who can find anysatisfaction in being poor; unless, indeed, it be the kind of poverty oneof their greatest saints refers to, saying, &lsquo;possess all things asthough ye possessed them not;&rsquo; which is what they call poverty inspirit. But thou, that other poverty&mdash;for it is of thee I am speakingnow&mdash;why dost thou love to fall out with gentlemen and men of goodbirth more than with other people? Why dost thou compel them to smear thecracks in their shoes, and to have the buttons of their coats, one silk,another hair, and another glass? Why must their ruffs be always crinkledlike endive leaves, and not crimped with a crimping iron?&rdquo; (Fromthis we may perceive the antiquity of starch and crimped ruffs.) Then hegoes on: &ldquo;Poor gentleman of good family! always cockering up hishonour, dining miserably and in secret, and making a hypocrite of thetoothpick with which he sallies out into the street after eating nothingto oblige him to use it! Poor fellow, I say, with his nervous honour,fancying they perceive a league off the patch on his shoe, thesweat-stains on his hat, the shabbiness of his cloak, and the hunger ofhis stomach!&rdquo;</p><p>All this was brought home to Don Quixote by the bursting of his stitches;however, he comforted himself on perceiving that Sancho had left behind apair of travelling boots, which he resolved to wear the next day. At lasthe went to bed, out of spirits and heavy at heart, as much because hemissed Sancho as because of the irreparable disaster to his stockings, thestitches of which he would have even taken up with silk of another colour,which is one of the greatest signs of poverty a gentleman can show in thecourse of his never-failing embarrassments. He put out the candles; butthe night was warm and he could not sleep; he rose from his bed and openedslightly a grated window that looked out on a beautiful garden, and as hedid so he perceived and heard people walking and talking in the garden. Heset himself to listen attentively, and those below raised their voices sothat he could hear these words:</p><p>&ldquo;Urge me not to sing, Emerencia, for thou knowest that ever sincethis stranger entered the castle and my eyes beheld him, I cannot sing butonly weep; besides my lady is a light rather than a heavy sleeper, and Iwould not for all the wealth of the world that she found us here; and evenif she were asleep and did not waken, my singing would be in vain, if thisstrange Æneas, who has come into my neighbourhood to flout me, sleeps onand wakens not to hear it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Heed not that, dear Altisidora,&rdquo; replied a voice; &ldquo;theduchess is no doubt asleep, and everybody in the house save the lord ofthy heart and disturber of thy soul; for just now I perceived him open thegrated window of his chamber, so he must be awake; sing, my poor sufferer,in a low sweet tone to the accompaniment of thy harp; and even if theduchess hears us we can lay the blame on the heat of the night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is not the point, Emerencia,&rdquo; replied Altisidora,&ldquo;it is that I would not that my singing should lay bare my heart,and that I should be thought a light and wanton maiden by those who knownot the mighty power of love; but come what may; better a blush on thecheeks than a sore in the heart;&rdquo; and here a harp softly touchedmade itself heard. As he listened to all this Don Quixote was in a stateof breathless amazement, for immediately the countless adventures likethis, with windows, gratings, gardens, serenades, lovemakings, andlanguishings, that he had read of in his trashy books of chivalry, came tohis mind. He at once concluded that some damsel of the duchess&rsquo;s wasin love with him, and that her modesty forced her to keep her passionsecret. He trembled lest he should fall, and made an inward resolution notto yield; and commending himself with all his might and soul to his ladyDulcinea he made up his mind to listen to the music; and to let them knowhe was there he gave a pretended sneeze, at which the damsels were not alittle delighted, for all they wanted was that Don Quixote should hearthem. So having tuned the harp, Altisidora, running her hand across thestrings, began this ballad:</p><p class="poem">O thou that art above in bed,<br/>    Between the holland sheets,<br/>A-lying there from night till morn,<br/>    With outstretched legs asleep;<br/><br/>O thou, most valiant knight of all<br/>    The famed Manchegan breed,<br/>Of purity and virtue more<br/>    Than gold of Araby;<br/><br/>Give ear unto a suffering maid,<br/>    Well-grown but evil-starr&rsquo;d,<br/>For those two suns of thine have lit<br/>    A fire within her heart.<br/><br/>Adventures seeking thou dost rove,<br/>    To others bringing woe;<br/>Thou scatterest wounds, but, ah, the balm<br/>    To heal them dost withhold!<br/><br/>Say, valiant youth, and so may God<br/>    Thy enterprises speed,<br/>Didst thou the light mid Libya&rsquo;s sands<br/>    Or Jaca&rsquo;s rocks first see?<br/><br/>Did scaly serpents give thee suck?<br/>    Who nursed thee when a babe?<br/>Wert cradled in the forest rude,<br/>    Or gloomy mountain cave?<br/><br/>O Dulcinea may be proud,<br/>    That plump and lusty maid;<br/>For she alone hath had the power<br/>    A tiger fierce to tame.<br/><br/>And she for this shall famous be<br/>    From Tagus to Jarama,<br/>From Manzanares to Genil,<br/>    From Duero to Arlanza.<br/><br/>Fain would I change with her, and give<br/>    A petticoat to boot,<br/>The best and bravest that I have,<br/>    All trimmed with gold galloon.<br/><br/>O for to be the happy fair<br/>    Thy mighty arms enfold,<br/>Or even sit beside thy bed<br/>    And scratch thy dusty poll!<br/><br/>I rave,&mdash;to favours such as these<br/>    Unworthy to aspire;<br/>Thy feet to tickle were enough<br/>    For one so mean as I.<br/><br/>What caps, what slippers silver-laced,<br/>    Would I on thee bestow!<br/>What damask breeches make for thee;<br/>    What fine long holland cloaks!<br/><br/>And I would give thee pearls that should<br/>    As big as oak-galls show;<br/>So matchless big that each might well<br/>    Be called the great &ldquo;Alone.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Manchegan Nero, look not down<br/>    From thy Tarpeian Rock<br/>Upon this burning heart, nor add<br/>    The fuel of thy wrath.<br/><br/>A virgin soft and young am I,<br/>    Not yet fifteen years old;<br/>(I&rsquo;m only three months past fourteen,<br/>    I swear upon my soul).<br/><br/>I hobble not nor do I limp,<br/>    All blemish I&rsquo;m without,<br/>And as I walk my lily locks<br/>    Are trailing on the ground.<br/><br/>And though my nose be rather flat,<br/>    And though my mouth be wide,<br/>My teeth like topazes exalt<br/>    My beauty to the sky.<br/><br/>Thou knowest that my voice is sweet,<br/>    That is if thou dost hear;<br/>And I am moulded in a form<br/>    Somewhat below the mean.<br/><br/>These charms, and many more, are thine,<br/>    Spoils to thy spear and bow all;<br/>A damsel of this house am I,<br/>    By name Altisidora.<br/></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p44c" id="p44c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p44c.jpg (266K)" src="images/p44c.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p44c.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Here the lay of the heart-stricken Altisidora came to an end, while thewarmly wooed Don Quixote began to feel alarm; and with a deep sigh he saidto himself, &ldquo;O that I should be such an unlucky knight that nodamsel can set eyes on me but falls in love with me! O that the peerlessDulcinea should be so unfortunate that they cannot let her enjoy myincomparable constancy in peace! What would ye with her, ye queens? Why doye persecute her, ye empresses?

They informed him that it was called the island of Barataria,either because the name of the village was Baratario, or because of thejoke by way of which the government had been conferred upon him. Onreaching the gates of the town, which was a walled one, the municipalitycame forth to meet him, the bells rang out a peal, and the inhabitantsshowed every sign of general satisfaction; and with great pomp theyconducted him to the principal church to give thanks to God, and then withburlesque ceremonies they presented him with the keys of the town, andacknowledged him as perpetual governor of the island of Barataria. Thecostume, the beard, and the fat squat figure of the new governorastonished all those who were not in on the secret, and even all who were,and they were not a few. Finally, leading him out of the church theycarried him to the judgment seat and seated him on it, and the duke&rsquo;smajordomo said to him, &ldquo;It is an ancient custom in this island,señor governor, that he who comes to take possession of this famous islandis bound to answer a question which shall be put to him, and which must bea somewhat knotty and difficult one; and by his answer the people take themeasure of their new governor&rsquo;s wit, and hail with joy or deplorehis arrival accordingly.&rdquo;</p><p>While the majordomo was making this speech Sancho was gazing at severallarge letters inscribed on the wall opposite his seat, and as he could notread he asked what that was that was painted on the wall. The answer was,&ldquo;Señor, there is written and recorded the day on which your lordshiptook possession of this island, and the inscription says, &lsquo;This day,the so-and-so of such-and-such a month and year, Señor Don Sancho Panzatook possession of this island; many years may he enjoy it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And whom do they call Don Sancho Panza?&rdquo; asked Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Your lordship,&rdquo; replied the majordomo; &ldquo;for no otherPanza but the one who is now seated in that chair has ever entered thisisland.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, let me tell you, brother,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;Ihaven&rsquo;t got the &lsquo;Don,&rsquo; nor has anyone of my family everhad it; my name is plain Sancho Panza, and Sancho was my father&rsquo;sname, and Sancho was my grandfather&rsquo;s and they were all Panzas,without any Dons or Doñas tacked on; I suspect that in this island thereare more Dons than stones; but never mind; God knows what I mean, andmaybe if my government lasts four days I&rsquo;ll weed out these Dons thatno doubt are as great a nuisance as the midges, they&rsquo;re so plenty.Let the majordomo go on with his question, and I&rsquo;ll give the bestanswer I can, whether the people deplore or not.&rdquo;</p><p>At this instant there came into court two old men, one carrying a cane byway of a walking-stick, and the one who had no stick said, &ldquo;Señor,some time ago I lent this good man ten gold-crowns in gold to gratify himand do him a service, on the condition that he was to return them to mewhenever I should ask for them. A long time passed before I asked forthem, for I would not put him to any greater straits to return them thanhe was in when I lent them to him; but thinking he was growing carelessabout payment I asked for them once and several times; and not only willhe not give them back, but he denies that he owes them, and says I neverlent him any such crowns; or if I did, that he repaid them; and I have nowitnesses either of the loan, or the payment, for he never paid me; I wantyour worship to put him to his oath, and if he swears he returned them tome I forgive him the debt here and before God.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p45b" id="p45b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p45b.jpg (400K)" src="images/p45b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p45b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;What say you to this, good old man, you with the stick?&rdquo; saidSancho.</p><p>To which the old man replied, &ldquo;I admit, señor, that he lent them tome; but let your worship lower your staff, and as he leaves it to my oath,I&rsquo;ll swear that I gave them back, and paid him really and truly.&rdquo;</p><p>The governor lowered the staff, and as he did so the old man who had thestick handed it to the other old man to hold for him while he swore, as ifhe found it in his way; and then laid his hand on the cross of the staff,saying that it was true the ten crowns that were demanded of him had beenlent him; but that he had with his own hand given them back into the handof the other, and that he, not recollecting it, was always asking forthem.</p><p>Seeing this the great governor asked the creditor what answer he had tomake to what his opponent said. He said that no doubt his debtor had toldthe truth, for he believed him to be an honest man and a good Christian,and he himself must have forgotten when and how he had given him back thecrowns; and that from that time forth he would make no further demand uponhim.</p><p>The debtor took his stick again, and bowing his head left the court.Observing this, and how, without another word, he made off, and observingtoo the resignation of the plaintiff, Sancho buried his head in his bosomand remained for a short space in deep thought, with the forefinger of hisright hand on his brow and nose; then he raised his head and bade themcall back the old man with the stick, for he had already taken hisdeparture. They brought him back, and as soon as Sancho saw him he said,&ldquo;Honest man, give me that stick, for I want it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;here it is señor,&rdquo;and he put it into his hand.</p><p>Sancho took it and, handing it to the other old man, said to him, &ldquo;Go,and God be with you; for now you are paid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, señor!&rdquo; returned the old man; &ldquo;why, is this caneworth ten gold-crowns?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the governor, &ldquo;or if not I am the greatestdolt in the world; now you will see whether I have got the headpiece togovern a whole kingdom;&rdquo; and he ordered the cane to be broken intwo, there, in the presence of all. It was done, and in the middle of itthey found ten gold-crowns. All were filled with amazement, and lookedupon their governor as another Solomon. They asked him how he had come tothe conclusion that the ten crowns were in the cane; he replied, thatobserving how the old man who swore gave the stick to his opponent whilehe was taking the oath, and swore that he had really and truly given himthe crowns, and how as soon as he had done swearing he asked for the stickagain, it came into his head that the sum demanded must be inside it; andfrom this he said it might be seen that God sometimes guides those whogovern in their judgments, even though they may be fools; besides he hadhimself heard the curate of his village mention just such another case,and he had so good a memory, that if it was not that he forgot everythinghe wished to remember, there would not be such a memory in all the island.To conclude, the old men went off, one crestfallen, and the other in highcontentment, all who were present were astonished, and he who wasrecording the words, deeds, and movements of Sancho could not make up hismind whether he was to look upon him and set him down as a fool or as aman of sense.</p><p>As soon as this case was disposed of, there came into court a womanholding on with a tight grip to a man dressed like a well-to-do cattledealer, and she came forward making a great outcry and exclaiming, &ldquo;Justice,señor governor, justice! and if I don&rsquo;t get it on earth I&rsquo;llgo look for it in heaven. Señor governor of my soul, this wicked mancaught me in the middle of the fields here and used my body as if it wasan ill-washed rag, and, woe is me! got from me what I had kept thesethree-and-twenty years and more, defending it against Moors andChristians, natives and strangers; and I always as hard as an oak, andkeeping myself as pure as a salamander in the fire, or wool among thebrambles, for this good fellow to come now with clean hands to handle me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It remains to be proved whether this gallant has clean hands ornot,&rdquo; said Sancho; and turning to the man he asked him what he hadto say in answer to the woman&rsquo;s charge.</p><p>He all in confusion made answer, &ldquo;Sirs, I am a poor pig dealer, andthis morning I left the village to sell (saving your presence) four pigs,and between dues and cribbings they got out of me little less than theworth of them. As I was returning to my village I fell in on the road withthis good dame, and the devil who makes a coil and a mess out ofeverything, yoked us together. I paid her fairly, but she not contentedlaid hold of me and never let go until she brought me here; she says Iforced her, but she lies by the oath I swear or am ready to swear; andthis is the whole truth and every particle of it.&rdquo;</p><p>The governor on this asked him if he had any money in silver about him; hesaid he had about twenty ducats in a leather purse in his bosom. Thegovernor bade him take it out and hand it to the complainant; he obeyedtrembling; the woman took it, and making a thousand salaams to all andpraying to God for the long life and health of the señor governor who hadsuch regard for distressed orphans and virgins, she hurried out of courtwith the purse grasped in both her hands, first looking, however, to seeif the money it contained was silver.</p><p>As soon as she was gone Sancho said to the cattle dealer, whose tears werealready starting and whose eyes and heart were following his purse,&ldquo;Good fellow, go after that woman and take the purse from her, byforce even, and come back with it here;&rdquo; and he did not say it toone who was a fool or deaf, for the man was off like a flash of lightning,and ran to do as he was bid.</p><p>All the bystanders waited anxiously to see the end of the case, andpresently both man and woman came back at even closer grips than before,she with her petticoat up and the purse in the lap of it, and hestruggling hard to take it from her, but all to no purpose, so stout wasthe woman&rsquo;s defence, she all the while crying out, &ldquo;Justicefrom God and the world! see here, señor governor, the shamelessness andboldness of this villain, who in the middle of the town, in the middle ofthe street, wanted to take from me the purse your worship bade him giveme.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And did he take it?&rdquo; asked the governor.</p><p>&ldquo;Take it!&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d let my life betaken from me sooner than the purse. A pretty child I&rsquo;d be! It&rsquo;sanother sort of cat they must throw in my face, and not that poor scurvyknave. Pincers and hammers, mallets and chisels would not get it out of mygrip; no, nor lions&rsquo; claws; the soul from out of my body first!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is right,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;I own myself beaten andpowerless; I confess I haven&rsquo;t the strength to take it from her;&rdquo;and he let go his hold of her.</p><p>Upon this the governor said to the woman, &ldquo;Let me see that purse, myworthy and sturdy friend.&rdquo; She handed it to him at once, and thegovernor returned it to the man, and said to the unforced mistress offorce, &ldquo;Sister, if you had shown as much, or only half as much,spirit and vigour in defending your body as you have shown in defendingthat purse, the strength of Hercules could not have forced you. Be off,and God speed you, and bad luck to you, and don&rsquo;t show your face inall this island, or within six leagues of it on any side, under pain oftwo hundred lashes; be off at once, I say, you shameless, cheating shrew.&rdquo;</p><p>The woman was cowed and went off disconsolately, hanging her head; and thegovernor said to the man, &ldquo;Honest man, go home with your money, andGod speed you; and for the future, if you don&rsquo;t want to lose it, seethat you don&rsquo;t take it into your head to yoke with anybody.&rdquo;The man thanked him as clumsily as he could and went his way, and thebystanders were again filled with admiration at their new governor&rsquo;sjudgments and sentences.</p><p>Next, two men, one apparently a farm labourer, and the other a tailor, forhe had a pair of shears in his hand, presented themselves before him, andthe tailor said, &ldquo;Señor governor, this labourer and I come beforeyour worship by reason of this honest man coming to my shop yesterday (forsaving everybody&rsquo;s presence I&rsquo;m a passed tailor, God bethanked), and putting a piece of cloth into my hands and asking me,&lsquo;Señor, will there be enough in this cloth to make me a cap?&rsquo;Measuring the cloth I said there would. He probably suspected&mdash;as Isupposed, and I supposed right&mdash;that I wanted to steal some of thecloth, led to think so by his own roguery and the bad opinion people haveof tailors; and he told me to see if there would be enough for two. Iguessed what he would be at, and I said &lsquo;yes.&rsquo; He, stillfollowing up his original unworthy notion, went on adding cap after cap,and I &lsquo;yes&rsquo; after &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; until we got as far asfive. He has just this moment come for them; I gave them to him, but hewon&rsquo;t pay me for the making; on the contrary, he calls upon me topay him, or else return his cloth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is all this true, brother?&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the man; &ldquo;but will your worship make himshow the five caps he has made me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said the tailor; and drawing his handfrom under his cloak he showed five caps stuck upon the five fingers ofit, and said, &ldquo;there are the caps this good man asks for; and by Godand upon my conscience I haven&rsquo;t a scrap of cloth left, and I&rsquo;lllet the work be examined by the inspectors of the trade.&rdquo;</p><p>All present laughed at the number of caps and the novelty of the suit;Sancho set himself to think for a moment, and then said, &ldquo;It seemsto me that in this case it is not necessary to deliver long-windedarguments, but only to give off-hand the judgment of an honest man; and somy decision is that the tailor lose the making and the labourer the cloth,and that the caps go to the prisoners in the gaol, and let there be nomore about it.&rdquo;</p><p>If the previous decision about the cattle dealer&rsquo;s purse excited theadmiration of the bystanders, this provoked their laughter; however, thegovernor&rsquo;s orders were after all executed. All this, having beentaken down by his chronicler, was at once despatched to the duke, who waslooking out for it with great eagerness; and here let us leave the goodSancho; for his master, sorely troubled in mind by Altisidora&rsquo;smusic, has pressing claims upon us now.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p45e" id="p45e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p45e.jpg (11K)" src="images/p45e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch46b" id="ch46b"></a>CHAPTER XLVI.<br/>OF THE TERRIBLE BELL AND CAT FRIGHT THAT DON QUIXOTE GOT IN THE COURSE OFTHE ENAMOURED ALTISIDORA&rsquo;S WOOING</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p46a" id="p46a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p46a.jpg (58K)" src="images/p46a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p46a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>We left Don Quixote wrapped up in the reflections which the music of theenamourned maid Altisidora had given rise to. He went to bed with them,and just like fleas they would not let him sleep or get a moment&rsquo;srest, and the broken stitches of his stockings helped them. But as Time isfleet and no obstacle can stay his course, he came riding on the hours,and morning very soon arrived. Seeing which Don Quixote quitted the softdown, and, nowise slothful, dressed himself in his chamois suit and put onhis travelling boots to hide the disaster to his stockings. He threw overhim his scarlet mantle, put on his head a montera of green velvet trimmedwith silver edging, flung across his shoulder the baldric with his goodtrenchant sword, took up a large rosary that he always carried with him,and with great solemnity and precision of gait proceeded to theantechamber where the duke and duchess were already dressed and waitingfor him.

Such was the din of thebells and the squalling of the cats, that though the duke and duchess werethe contrivers of the joke they were startled by it, while Don Quixotestood paralysed with fear; and as luck would have it, two or three of thecats made their way in through the grating of his chamber, and flying fromone side to the other, made it seem as if there was a legion of devils atlarge in it. They extinguished the candles that were burning in the room,and rushed about seeking some way of escape; the cord with the large bellsnever ceased rising and falling; and most of the people of the castle, notknowing what was really the matter, were at their wits&rsquo; end withastonishment. Don Quixote sprang to his feet, and drawing his sword, beganmaking passes at the grating, shouting out, &ldquo;Avaunt, malignantenchanters! avaunt, ye witchcraft-working rabble! I am Don Quixote of LaMancha, against whom your evil machinations avail not nor have any power.&rdquo;And turning upon the cats that were running about the room, he madeseveral cuts at them. They dashed at the grating and escaped by it, saveone that, finding itself hard pressed by the slashes of Don Quixote&rsquo;ssword, flew at his face and held on to his nose tooth and nail, with thepain of which he began to shout his loudest. The duke and duchess hearingthis, and guessing what it was, ran with all haste to his room, and as thepoor gentleman was striving with all his might to detach the cat from hisface, they opened the door with a master-key and went in with lights andwitnessed the unequal combat. The duke ran forward to part the combatants,but Don Quixote cried out aloud, &ldquo;Let no one take him from me; leaveme hand to hand with this demon, this wizard, this enchanter; I will teachhim, I myself, who Don Quixote of La Mancha is.&rdquo; The cat, however,never minding these threats, snarled and held on; but at last the dukepulled it off and flung it out of the window. Don Quixote was left with aface as full of holes as a sieve and a nose not in very good condition,and greatly vexed that they did not let him finish the battle he had beenso stoutly fighting with that villain of an enchanter. They sent for someoil of John&rsquo;s wort, and Altisidora herself with her own fair handsbandaged all the wounded parts; and as she did so she said to him in a lowvoice. &ldquo;All these mishaps have befallen thee, hardhearted knight,for the sin of thy insensibility and obstinacy; and God grant thy squireSancho may forget to whip himself, so that that dearly beloved Dulcinea ofthine may never be released from her enchantment, that thou mayest nevercome to her bed, at least while I who adore thee am alive.&rdquo;</p><p>To all this Don Quixote made no answer except to heave deep sighs, andthen stretched himself on his bed, thanking the duke and duchess for theirkindness, not because he stood in any fear of that bell-ringing rabble ofenchanters in cat shape, but because he recognised their good intentionsin coming to his rescue. The duke and duchess left him to repose andwithdrew greatly grieved at the unfortunate result of the joke; as theynever thought the adventure would have fallen so heavy on Don Quixote orcost him so dear, for it cost him five days of confinement to his bed,during which he had another adventure, pleasanter than the late one, whichhis chronicler will not relate just now in order that he may turn hisattention to Sancho Panza, who was proceeding with great diligence anddrollery in his government.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p46e" id="p46e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p46e.jpg (65K)" src="images/p46e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch47b" id="ch47b"></a>CHAPTER XLVII.<br/>WHEREIN IS CONTINUED THE ACCOUNT OF HOW SANCHO PANZA CONDUCTED HIMSELF INHIS GOVERNMENT</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p47a" id="p47a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p47a.jpg (139K)" src="images/p47a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p47a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The history says that from the justice court they carried Sancho to asumptuous palace, where in a spacious chamber there was a table laid outwith royal magnificence. The clarions sounded as Sancho entered the room,and four pages came forward to present him with water for his hands, whichSancho received with great dignity. The music ceased, and Sancho seatedhimself at the head of the table, for there was only that seat placed, andno more than one cover laid. A personage, who it appeared afterwards was aphysician, placed himself standing by his side with a whalebone wand inhis hand. They then lifted up a fine white cloth covering fruit and agreat variety of dishes of different sorts; one who looked like a studentsaid grace, and a page put a laced bib on Sancho, while another who playedthe part of head carver placed a dish of fruit before him. But hardly hadhe tasted a morsel when the man with the wand touched the plate with it,and they took it away from before him with the utmost celerity. Thecarver, however, brought him another dish, and Sancho proceeded to try it;but before he could get at it, not to say taste it, already the wand hadtouched it and a page had carried it off with the same promptitude as thefruit. Sancho seeing this was puzzled, and looking from one to anotherasked if this dinner was to be eaten after the fashion of a jugglerytrick.</p><p>To this he with the wand replied, &ldquo;It is not to be eaten, señorgovernor, except as is usual and customary in other islands where thereare governors. I, señor, am a physician, and I am paid a salary in thisisland to serve its governors as such, and I have a much greater regardfor their health than for my own, studying day and night and making myselfacquainted with the governor&rsquo;s constitution, in order to be able tocure him when he falls sick. The chief thing I have to do is to attend athis dinners and suppers and allow him to eat what appears to me to be fitfor him, and keep from him what I think will do him harm and be injuriousto his stomach; and therefore I ordered that plate of fruit to be removedas being too moist, and that other dish I ordered to be removed as beingtoo hot and containing many spices that stimulate thirst; for he whodrinks much kills and consumes the radical moisture wherein life consists.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that dish of roast partridgesthere that seems so savoury will not do me any harm.&rdquo;</p><p>To this the physician replied, &ldquo;Of those my lord the governor shallnot eat so long as I live.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;our master Hippocrates,the polestar and beacon of medicine, says in one of his aphorisms <i>omnissaturatio mala, perdicis autem pessima</i>, which means &lsquo;all repletionis bad, but that of partridge is the worst of all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;let señor doctor see amongthe dishes that are on the table what will do me most good and least harm,and let me eat it, without tapping it with his stick; for by the life ofthe governor, and so may God suffer me to enjoy it, but I&rsquo;m dying ofhunger; and in spite of the doctor and all he may say, to deny me food isthe way to take my life instead of prolonging it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your worship is right, señor governor,&rdquo; said the physician;&ldquo;and therefore your worship, I consider, should not eat of thosestewed rabbits there, because it is a furry kind of food; if that vealwere not roasted and served with pickles, you might try it; but it is outof the question.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That big dish that is smoking farther off,&rdquo; said Sancho,&ldquo;seems to me to be an olla podrida, and out of the diversity ofthings in such ollas, I can&rsquo;t fail to light upon something tasty andgood for me.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p47b" id="p47b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p47b.jpg (372K)" src="images/p47b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p47b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;<i>Absit</i>,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;far from us be any suchbase thought! There is nothing in the world less nourishing than an ollapodrida; to canons, or rectors of colleges, or peasants&rsquo; weddings withyour ollas podridas, but let us have none of them on the tables of governors,where everything that is present should be delicate and refined; and the reasonis, that always, everywhere and by everybody, simple medicines are moreesteemed than compound ones, for we cannot go wrong in those that are simple,while in the compound we may, by merely altering the quantity of the thingscomposing them. But what I am of opinion the governor should eat now in orderto preserve and fortify his health is a hundred or so of wafer cakes and a fewthin slices of conserve of quinces, which will settle his stomach and help hisdigestion.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho on hearing this threw himself back in his chair and surveyed thedoctor steadily, and in a solemn tone asked him what his name was andwhere he had studied.</p><p>He replied, &ldquo;My name, señor governor, is Doctor Pedro Recio deAguero I am a native of a place called Tirteafuera which lies betweenCaracuel and Almodóvar del Campo, on the right-hand side, and I have thedegree of doctor from the university of Osuna.&rdquo;</p><p>To which Sancho, glowing all over with rage, returned, &ldquo;Then letDoctor Pedro Recio de Malaguero, native of Tirteafuera, a place that&rsquo;son the right-hand side as we go from Caracuel to Almodóvar del Campo,graduate of Osuna, get out of my presence at once; or I swear by the sun I&rsquo;lltake a cudgel, and by dint of blows, beginning with him, I&rsquo;ll notleave a doctor in the whole island; at least of those I know to beignorant; for as to learned, wise, sensible physicians, them I willreverence and honour as divine persons. Once more I say let Pedro Recioget out of this or I&rsquo;ll take this chair I am sitting on and break itover his head. And if they call me to account for it, I&rsquo;ll clearmyself by saying I served God in killing a bad doctor&mdash;a generalexecutioner. And now give me something to eat, or else take yourgovernment; for a trade that does not feed its master is not worth twobeans.&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor was dismayed when he saw the governor in such a passion, and hewould have made a Tirteafuera out of the room but that the same instant apost-horn sounded in the street; and the carver putting his head out ofthe window turned round and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a courier from my lordthe duke, no doubt with some despatch of importance.&rdquo;</p><p>The courier came in all sweating and flurried, and taking a paper from hisbosom, placed it in the governor&rsquo;s hands. Sancho handed it to themajordomo and bade him read the superscription, which ran thus:</p><p><i>To Don Sancho Panza, Governor of the Island of Barataria, into his own handsor those of his secretary.</i></p><p class="noindent">Sancho when he heard this said, &ldquo;Which of you is my secretary?&rdquo;&ldquo;I am, señor,&rdquo; said one of those present, &ldquo;for I can read andwrite, and am a Biscayan.&rdquo; &ldquo;With that addition,&rdquo; said Sancho,&ldquo;you might be secretary to the emperor himself; open this paper and seewhat it says.&rdquo; The new-born secretary obeyed, and having read thecontents said the matter was one to be discussed in private. Sancho ordered thechamber to be cleared, the majordomo and the carver only remaining; so thedoctor and the others withdrew, and then the secretary read the letter, whichwas as follows:</p><p class="letter">It has come to my knowledge, Señor Don Sancho Panza, that certain enemies ofmine and of the island are about to make a furious attack upon it some night, Iknow not when. It behoves you to be on the alert and keep watch, that theysurprise you not. I also know by trustworthy spies that four persons haveentered the town in disguise in order to take your life, because they stand indread of your great capacity; keep your eyes open and take heed who approachesyou to address you, and eat nothing that is presented to you. I will take careto send you aid if you find yourself in difficulty, but in all things you willact as may be expected of your judgment. From this place, the Sixteenth ofAugust, at four in the morning.</p><p class="right">Your friend,<br/>THE DUKE</p><p>Sancho was astonished, and those who stood by made believe to be so too,and turning to the majordomo he said to him, &ldquo;What we have got to dofirst, and it must be done at once, is to put Doctor Recio in the lock-up;for if anyone wants to kill me it is he, and by a slow death and the worstof all, which is hunger.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Likewise,&rdquo; said the carver, &ldquo;it is my opinion yourworship should not eat anything that is on this table, for the whole was apresent from some nuns; and as they say, &lsquo;behind the cross there&rsquo;sthe devil.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny it,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;so for thepresent give me a piece of bread and four pounds or so of grapes; nopoison can come in them; for the fact is I can&rsquo;t go on withouteating; and if we are to be prepared for these battles that arethreatening us we must be well provisioned; for it is the tripes thatcarry the heart and not the heart the tripes. And you, secretary, answermy lord the duke and tell him that all his commands shall be obeyed to theletter, as he directs; and say from me to my lady the duchess that I kissher hands, and that I beg of her not to forget to send my letter andbundle to my wife Teresa Panza by a messenger; and I will take it as agreat favour and will not fail to serve her in all that may lie within mypower; and as you are about it you may enclose a kiss of the hand to mymaster Don Quixote that he may see I am grateful bread; and as a goodsecretary and a good Biscayan you may add whatever you like and whateverwill come in best; and now take away this cloth and give me something toeat, and I&rsquo;ll be ready to meet all the spies and assassins andenchanters that may come against me or my island.&rdquo;</p><p>At this instant a page entered saying, &ldquo;Here is a farmer onbusiness, who wants to speak to your lordship on a matter of greatimportance, he says.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very odd,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;the ways of thesemen on business; is it possible they can be such fools as not to see thatan hour like this is no hour for coming on business? We who govern and wewho are judges&mdash;are we not men of flesh and blood, and are we not tobe allowed the time required for taking rest, unless they&rsquo;d have usmade of marble? By God and on my conscience, if the government remains inmy hands (which I have a notion it won&rsquo;t), I&rsquo;ll bring morethan one man on business to order. However, tell this good man to come in;but take care first of all that he is not some spy or one of my assassins.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;for he looks like asimple fellow, and either I know very little or he is as good as goodbread.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is nothing to be afraid of,&rdquo; said the majordomo,&ldquo;for we are all here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would it be possible, carver,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;now thatDoctor Pedro Recio is not here, to let me eat something solid andsubstantial, if it were even a piece of bread and an onion?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To-night at supper,&rdquo; said the carver, &ldquo;the shortcomingsof the dinner shall be made good, and your lordship shall be fullycontented.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God grant it,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>The farmer now came in, a well-favoured man that one might see a thousandleagues off was an honest fellow and a good soul. The first thing he saidwas, &ldquo;Which is the lord governor here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which should it be,&rdquo; said the secretary, &ldquo;but he who isseated in the chair?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I humble myself before him,&rdquo; said the farmer; and goingon his knees he asked for his hand, to kiss it. Sancho refused it, andbade him stand up and say what he wanted. The farmer obeyed, and thensaid, &ldquo;I am a farmer, señor, a native of Miguelturra, a village twoleagues from Ciudad Real.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Another Tirteafuera!&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;say on, brother; Iknow Miguelturra very well I can tell you, for it&rsquo;s not very farfrom my own town.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The case is this, señor,&rdquo; continued the farmer, &ldquo;thatby God&rsquo;s mercy I am married with the leave and licence of the holyRoman Catholic Church; I have two sons, students, and the younger isstudying to become bachelor, and the elder to be licentiate; I am awidower, for my wife died, or more properly speaking, a bad doctor killedher on my hands, giving her a purge when she was with child; and if it hadpleased God that the child had been born, and was a boy, I would have puthim to study for doctor, that he might not envy his brothers the bachelorand the licentiate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So that if your wife had not died, or had not been killed, youwould not now be a widower,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;No, señor, certainly not,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got that much settled,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;geton, brother, for it&rsquo;s more bed-time than business-time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;this son of mine who isgoing to be a bachelor, fell in love in the said town with a damsel calledClara Perlerina, daughter of Andres Perlerino, a very rich farmer; andthis name of Perlerines does not come to them by ancestry or descent, butbecause all the family are paralytics, and for a better name they callthem Perlerines; though to tell the truth the damsel is as fair as anOriental pearl, and like a flower of the field, if you look at her on theright side; on the left not so much, for on that side she wants an eyethat she lost by small-pox; and though her face is thickly and deeplypitted, those who love her say they are not pits that are there, but thegraves where the hearts of her lovers are buried. She is so cleanly thatnot to soil her face she carries her nose turned up, as they say, so thatone would fancy it was running away from her mouth; and with all this shelooks extremely well, for she has a wide mouth; and but for wanting ten ora dozen teeth and grinders she might compare and compete with thecomeliest. Of her lips I say nothing, for they are so fine and thin that,if lips might be reeled, one might make a skein of them; but being of adifferent colour from ordinary lips they are wonderful, for they aremottled, blue, green, and purple&mdash;let my lord the governor pardon mefor painting so minutely the charms of her who some time or other will bemy daughter; for I love her, and I don&rsquo;t find her amiss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Paint what you will,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I enjoy yourpainting, and if I had dined there could be no dessert more to my tastethan your portrait.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I have still to furnish,&rdquo; said the farmer; &ldquo;but atime will come when we may be able if we are not now; and I can tell you,señor, if I could paint her gracefulness and her tall figure, it wouldastonish you; but that is impossible because she is bent double with herknees up to her mouth; but for all that it is easy to see that if shecould stand up she&rsquo;d knock her head against the ceiling; and shewould have given her hand to my bachelor ere this, only that she can&rsquo;tstretch it out, for it&rsquo;s contracted; but still one can see itselegance and fine make by its long furrowed nails.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That will do, brother,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;consider you havepainted her from head to foot; what is it you want now? Come to the pointwithout all this beating about the bush, and all these scraps andadditions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I want your worship, señor,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;to do methe favour of giving me a letter of recommendation to the girl&rsquo;sfather, begging him to be so good as to let this marriage take place, aswe are not ill-matched either in the gifts of fortune or of nature; for totell the truth, señor governor, my son is possessed of a devil, and thereis not a day but the evil spirits torment him three or four times; andfrom having once fallen into the fire, he has his face puckered up like apiece of parchment, and his eyes watery and always running; but he has thedisposition of an angel, and if it was not for belabouring and pummellinghimself he&rsquo;d be a saint.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there anything else you want, good man?&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another thing I&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; said the farmer,&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid to mention it; however, out it must; for afterall I can&rsquo;t let it be rotting in my breast, come what may. I mean,señor, that I&rsquo;d like your worship to give me three hundred or sixhundred ducats as a help to my bachelor&rsquo;s portion, to help him insetting up house; for they must, in short, live by themselves, withoutbeing subject to the interferences of their fathers-in-law.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just see if there&rsquo;s anything else you&rsquo;d like,&rdquo;said Sancho, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t hold back from mentioning it out ofbashfulness or modesty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, indeed there is not,&rdquo; said the farmer.</p><p>The moment he said this the governor started to his feet, and seizing thechair he had been sitting on exclaimed, &ldquo;By all that&rsquo;s good,you ill-bred, boorish Don Bumpkin, if you don&rsquo;t get out of this atonce and hide yourself from my sight, I&rsquo;ll lay your head open withthis chair. You whoreson rascal, you devil&rsquo;s own painter, and is itat this hour you come to ask me for six hundred ducats! How should I havethem, you stinking brute? And why should I give them to you if I had them,you knave and blockhead? What have I to do with Miguelturra or the wholefamily of the Perlerines? Get out I say, or by the life of my lord theduke I&rsquo;ll do as I said. You&rsquo;re not from Miguelturra, but someknave sent here from hell to tempt me. Why, you villain, I have not yethad the government half a day, and you want me to have six hundred ducatsalready!&rdquo;</p><p>The carver made signs to the farmer to leave the room, which he did withhis head down, and to all appearance in terror lest the governor shouldcarry his threats into effect, for the rogue knew very well how to playhis part.</p><p>But let us leave Sancho in his wrath, and peace be with them all; and letus return to Don Quixote, whom we left with his face bandaged and doctoredafter the cat wounds, of which he was not cured for eight days; and on oneof these there befell him what Cide Hamete promises to relate with thatexactitude and truth with which he is wont to set forth everythingconnected with this great history, however minute it may be.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p47e" id="p47e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p47e.jpg (12K)" src="images/p47e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch48b" id="ch48b"></a>CHAPTER XLVIII.<br/>OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH DOÑA RODRIGUEZ, THE DUCHESS&rsquo;SDUENNA, TOGETHER WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY OF RECORD AND ETERNALREMEMBRANCE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p48a" id="p48a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p48a.jpg (131K)" src="images/p48a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p48a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Exceedingly moody and dejected was the sorely wounded Don Quixote, withhis face bandaged and marked, not by the hand of God, but by the claws ofa cat, mishaps incidental to knight-errantry.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p48b" id="p48b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p48b.jpg (316K)" src="images/p48b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p48b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Six days he remained without appearing in public, and one night as he layawake thinking of his misfortunes and of Altisidora&rsquo;s pursuit ofhim, he perceived that someone was opening the door of his room with akey, and he at once made up his mind that the enamoured damsel was comingto make an assault upon his chastity and put him in danger of failing inthe fidelity he owed to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;said he, firmly persuaded of the truth of his idea (and he said it loudenough to be heard), &ldquo;the greatest beauty upon earth shall not availto make me renounce my adoration of her whom I bear stamped and graved inthe core of my heart and the secret depths of my bowels; be thou, ladymine, transformed into a clumsy country wench, or into a nymph of goldenTagus weaving a web of silk and gold, let Merlin or Montesinos hold theecaptive where they will; where&rsquo;er thou art, thou art mine, and where&rsquo;erI am, must be thine.&rdquo; The very instant he had uttered these words,the door opened.

The spectre still advanced, andon reaching the middle of the room, looked up and saw the energy withwhich Don Quixote was crossing himself; and if he was scared by seeingsuch a figure as hers, she was terrified at the sight of his; for themoment she saw his tall yellow form with the coverlet and the bandagesthat disfigured him, she gave a loud scream, and exclaiming, &ldquo;Jesus!what&rsquo;s this I see?&rdquo; let fall the candle in her fright, andthen finding herself in the dark, turned about to make off, but stumblingon her skirts in her consternation, she measured her length with a mightyfall.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p48c" id="p48c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p48c.jpg (249K)" src="images/p48c.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p48c.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote in his trepidation began saying, &ldquo;I conjure thee,phantom, or whatever thou art, tell me what thou art and what thou wouldstwith me. If thou art a soul in torment, say so, and all that my powers cando I will do for thee; for I am a Catholic Christian and love to do goodto all the world, and to this end I have embraced the order ofknight-errantry to which I belong, the province of which extends to doinggood even to souls in purgatory.&rdquo;</p><p>The unfortunate duenna hearing herself thus conjured, by her own fearguessed Don Quixote&rsquo;s and in a low plaintive voice answered, &ldquo;SeñorDon Quixote&mdash;if so be you are indeed Don Quixote&mdash;I am nophantom or spectre or soul in purgatory, as you seem to think, but DoñaRodriguez, duenna of honour to my lady the duchess, and I come to you withone of those grievances your worship is wont to redress.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, Señora Doña Rodriguez,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;doyou perchance come to transact any go-between business? Because I musttell you I am not available for anybody&rsquo;s purpose, thanks to thepeerless beauty of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso. In short, Señora DoñaRodriguez, if you will leave out and put aside all love messages, you maygo and light your candle and come back, and we will discuss all thecommands you have for me and whatever you wish, saving only, as I said,all seductive communications.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I carry nobody&rsquo;s messages, señor,&rdquo; said the duenna;&ldquo;little you know me. Nay, I&rsquo;m not far enough advanced in yearsto take to any such childish tricks. God be praised I have a soul in mybody still, and all my teeth and grinders in my mouth, except one or twothat the colds, so common in this Aragon country, have robbed me of. Butwait a little, while I go and light my candle, and I will returnimmediately and lay my sorrows before you as before one who relieves thoseof all the world;&rdquo; and without staying for an answer she quitted theroom and left Don Quixote tranquilly meditating while he waited for her. Athousand thoughts at once suggested themselves to him on the subject ofthis new adventure, and it struck him as being ill done and worse advisedin him to expose himself to the danger of breaking his plighted faith tohis lady; and said he to himself, &ldquo;Who knows but that the devil,being wily and cunning, may be trying now to entrap me with a duenna,having failed with empresses, queens, duchesses, marchionesses, andcountesses? Many a time have I heard it said by many a man of sense thathe will sooner offer you a flat-nosed wench than a roman-nosed one; andwho knows but this privacy, this opportunity, this silence, may awaken mysleeping desires, and lead me in these my latter years to fall where Ihave never tripped? In cases of this sort it is better to flee than toawait the battle. But I must be out of my senses to think and utter suchnonsense; for it is impossible that a long, white-hooded spectacled duennacould stir up or excite a wanton thought in the most graceless bosom inthe world. Is there a duenna on earth that has fair flesh? Is there aduenna in the world that escapes being ill-tempered, wrinkled, andprudish? Avaunt, then, ye duenna crew, undelightful to all mankind. Oh,but that lady did well who, they say, had at the end of her reception rooma couple of figures of duennas with spectacles and lace-cushions, as if atwork, and those statues served quite as well to give an air of proprietyto the room as if they had been real duennas.&rdquo;</p><p>So saying he leaped off the bed, intending to close the door and not allowSeñora Rodriguez to enter; but as he went to shut it Señora Rodriguezreturned with a wax candle lighted, and having a closer view of DonQuixote, with the coverlet round him, and his bandages and night-cap, shewas alarmed afresh, and retreating a couple of paces, exclaimed, &ldquo;AmI safe, sir knight? for I don&rsquo;t look upon it as a sign of very greatvirtue that your worship should have got up out of bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I may well ask the same, señora,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;andI do ask whether I shall be safe from being assailed and forced?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of whom and against whom do you demand that security, sir knight?&rdquo;said the duenna.</p><p>&ldquo;Of you and against you I ask it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;forI am not marble, nor are you brass, nor is it now ten o&rsquo;clock in themorning, but midnight, or a trifle past it I fancy, and we are in a roommore secluded and retired than the cave could have been where thetreacherous and daring Æneas enjoyed the fair soft-hearted Dido. But giveme your hand, señora; I require no better protection than my owncontinence, and my own sense of propriety; as well as that which isinspired by that venerable head-dress;&rdquo; and so saying he kissed herright hand and took it in his own, she yielding it to him with equalceremoniousness. And here Cide Hamete inserts a parenthesis in which hesays that to have seen the pair marching from the door to the bed, linkedhand in hand in this way, he would have given the best of the two tunicshe had.</p><p>Don Quixote finally got into bed, and Doña Rodriguez took her seat on achair at some little distance from his couch, without taking off herspectacles or putting aside the candle. Don Quixote wrapped the bedclothesround him and covered himself up completely, leaving nothing but his facevisible, and as soon as they had both regained their composure he brokesilence, saying, &ldquo;Now, Señora Doña Rodriguez, you may unbosomyourself and out with everything you have in your sorrowful heart andafflicted bowels; and by me you shall be listened to with chaste ears, andaided by compassionate exertions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; replied the duenna; &ldquo;from your worship&rsquo;sgentle and winning presence only such a Christian answer could beexpected. The fact is, then, Señor Don Quixote, that though you see meseated in this chair, here in the middle of the kingdom of Aragon, and inthe attire of a despised outcast duenna, I am from the Asturias of Oviedo,and of a family with which many of the best of the province are connectedby blood; but my untoward fate and the improvidence of my parents, who, Iknow not how, were unseasonably reduced to poverty, brought me to thecourt of Madrid, where as a provision and to avoid greater misfortunes, myparents placed me as seamstress in the service of a lady of quality, and Iwould have you know that for hemming and sewing I have never beensurpassed by any all my life. My parents left me in service and returnedto their own country, and a few years later went, no doubt, to heaven, forthey were excellent good Catholic Christians. I was left an orphan withnothing but the miserable wages and trifling presents that are given toservants of my sort in palaces; but about this time, without anyencouragement on my part, one of the esquires of the household fell inlove with me, a man somewhat advanced in years, full-bearded andpersonable, and above all as good a gentleman as the king himself, for hecame of a mountain stock. We did not carry on our loves with such secrecybut that they came to the knowledge of my lady, and she, not to have anyfuss about it, had us married with the full sanction of the holy motherRoman Catholic Church, of which marriage a daughter was born to put an endto my good fortune, if I had any; not that I died in childbirth, for Ipassed through it safely and in due season, but because shortly afterwardsmy husband died of a certain shock he received, and had I time to tell youof it I know your worship would be surprised;&rdquo; and here she began toweep bitterly and said, &ldquo;Pardon me, Señor Don Quixote, if I amunable to control myself, for every time I think of my unfortunate husbandmy eyes fill up with tears. God bless me, with what an air of dignity heused to carry my lady behind him on a stout mule as black as jet! for inthose days they did not use coaches or chairs, as they say they do now,and ladies rode behind their squires. This much at least I cannot helptelling you, that you may observe the good breeding and punctiliousness ofmy worthy husband. As he was turning into the Calle de Santiago in Madrid,which is rather narrow, one of the alcaldes of the Court, with twoalguacils before him, was coming out of it, and as soon as my good squiresaw him he wheeled his mule about and made as if he would turn andaccompany him. My lady, who was riding behind him, said to him in a lowvoice, &lsquo;What are you about, you sneak, don&rsquo;t you see that I amhere?&rsquo; The alcalde like a polite man pulled up his horse and said tohim, &lsquo;Proceed, señor, for it is I, rather, who ought to accompany mylady Doña Casilda&rsquo;&mdash;for that was my mistress&rsquo;s name.Still my husband, cap in hand, persisted in trying to accompany thealcalde, and seeing this my lady, filled with rage and vexation, pulledout a big pin, or, I rather think, a bodkin, out of her needle-case anddrove it into his back with such force that my husband gave a loud yell,and writhing fell to the ground with his lady. Her two lacqueys ran torise her up, and the alcalde and the alguacils did the same; theGuadalajara gate was all in commotion&mdash;I mean the idlers congregatedthere; my mistress came back on foot, and my husband hurried away to abarber&rsquo;s shop protesting that he was run right through the guts. Thecourtesy of my husband was noised abroad to such an extent, that the boysgave him no peace in the street; and on this account, and because he wassomewhat shortsighted, my lady dismissed him; and it was chagrin at this Iam convinced beyond a doubt that brought on his death. I was left ahelpless widow, with a daughter on my hands growing up in beauty like thesea-foam; at length, however, as I had the character of being an excellentneedlewoman, my lady the duchess, then lately married to my lord the duke,offered to take me with her to this kingdom of Aragon, and my daughteralso, and here as time went by my daughter grew up and with her all thegraces in the world; she sings like a lark, dances quick as thought, footsit like a gipsy, reads and writes like a schoolmaster, and does sums likea miser; of her neatness I say nothing, for the running water is notpurer, and her age is now, if my memory serves me, sixteen years fivemonths and three days, one more or less. To come to the point, the son ofa very rich farmer, living in a village of my lord the duke&rsquo;s notvery far from here, fell in love with this girl of mine; and in short, howI know not, they came together, and under the promise of marrying her hemade a fool of my daughter, and will not keep his word. And though my lordthe duke is aware of it (for I have complained to him, not once but manyand many a time, and entreated him to order the farmer to marry mydaughter), he turns a deaf ear and will scarcely listen to me; the reasonbeing that as the deceiver&rsquo;s father is so rich, and lends him money,and is constantly going security for his debts, he does not like to offendor annoy him in any way. Now, señor, I want your worship to take it uponyourself to redress this wrong either by entreaty or by arms; for by whatall the world says you came into it to redress grievances and right wrongsand help the unfortunate. Let your worship put before you the unprotectedcondition of my daughter, her youth, and all the perfections I have saidshe possesses; and before God and on my conscience, out of all the damselsmy lady has, there is not one that comes up to the sole of her shoe, andthe one they call Altisidora, and look upon as the boldest and gayest ofthem, put in comparison with my daughter, does not come within two leaguesof her. For I would have you know, señor, all is not gold that glitters,and that same little Altisidora has more forwardness than good looks, andmore impudence than modesty; besides being not very sound, for she hassuch a disagreeable breath that one cannot bear to be near her for amoment; and even my lady the duchess&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll hold my tongue,for they say that walls have ears.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Doña Rodriguez, what ails my lady theduchess?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote.</p><p>&ldquo;Adjured in that way,&rdquo; replied the duenna, &ldquo;I cannothelp answering the question and telling the whole truth. Señor DonQuixote, have you observed the comeliness of my lady the duchess, thatsmooth complexion of hers like a burnished polished sword, those twocheeks of milk and carmine, that gay lively step with which she treads orrather seems to spurn the earth, so that one would fancy she wentradiating health wherever she passed? Well then, let me tell you she maythank, first of all God, for this, and next, two issues that she has, onein each leg, by which all the evil humours, of which the doctors say sheis full, are discharged.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Blessed Virgin!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Quixote; &ldquo;and is itpossible that my lady the duchess has drains of that sort? I would nothave believed it if the barefoot friars had told it me; but as the ladyDoña Rodriguez says so, it must be so. But surely such issues, and in suchplaces, do not discharge humours, but liquid amber. Verily, I do believenow that this practice of opening issues is a very important matter forthe health.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote had hardly said this, when the chamber door flew open with aloud bang, and with the start the noise gave her Doña Rodriguez let thecandle fall from her hand, and the room was left as dark as a wolf&rsquo;smouth, as the saying is. Suddenly the poor duenna felt two hands seize herby the throat, so tightly that she could not croak, while someone else,without uttering a word, very briskly hoisted up her petticoats, and withwhat seemed to be a slipper began to lay on so heartily that anyone wouldhave felt pity for her; but although Don Quixote felt it he never stirredfrom his bed, but lay quiet and silent, nay apprehensive that his turn fora drubbing might be coming. Nor was the apprehension an idle one; forleaving the duenna (who did not dare to cry out) well basted, the silentexecutioners fell upon Don Quixote, and stripping him of the sheet and thecoverlet, they pinched him so fast and so hard that he was driven todefend himself with his fists, and all this in marvellous silence. Thebattle lasted nearly half an hour, and then the phantoms fled; DoñaRodriguez gathered up her skirts, and bemoaning her fate went out withoutsaying a word to Don Quixote, and he, sorely pinched, puzzled, anddejected, remained alone, and there we will leave him, wondering who couldhave been the perverse enchanter who had reduced him to such a state; butthat shall be told in due season, for Sancho claims our attention, and themethodical arrangement of the story demands it.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p48e" id="p48e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p48e.jpg (28K)" src="images/p48e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch49b" id="ch49b"></a>CHAPTER XLIX.<br/>OF WHAT HAPPENED SANCHO IN MAKING THE ROUND OF HIS ISLAND</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p49a" id="p49a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p49a.jpg (170K)" src="images/p49a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p49a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>We left the great governor angered and irritated by that portrait-paintingrogue of a farmer who, instructed by the majordomo, as the majordomo was by theduke, tried to practise upon him; he however, fool, boor, and clown as he was,held his own against them all, saying to those round him and to Doctor PedroRecio, who as soon as the private business of the duke&rsquo;s letter wasdisposed of had returned to the room, &ldquo;Now I see plainly enough thatjudges and governors ought to be and must be made of brass not to feel theimportunities of the applicants that at all times and all seasons insist onbeing heard, and having their business despatched, and their own affairs and noothers attended to, come what may; and if the poor judge does not hear them andsettle the matter&mdash;either because he cannot or because that is not thetime set apart for hearing them&mdash;forthwith they abuse him, and run himdown, and gnaw at his bones, and even pick holes in his pedigree. You silly,stupid applicant, don&rsquo;t be in a hurry; wait for the proper time andseason for doing business; don&rsquo;t come at dinner-hour, or at bed-time; forjudges are only flesh and blood, and must give to Nature what she naturallydemands of them; all except myself, for in my case I give her nothing to eat,thanks to Señor Doctor Pedro Recio Tirteafuera here, who would have me die ofhunger, and declares that death to be life; and the same sort of life may Godgive him and all his kind&mdash;I mean the bad doctors; for the good onesdeserve palms and laurels.&rdquo;</p><p>All who knew Sancho Panza were astonished to hear him speak so elegantly,and did not know what to attribute it to unless it were that office andgrave responsibility either smarten or stupefy men&rsquo;s wits. At lastDoctor Pedro Recio Agilers of Tirteafuera promised to let him have supperthat night though it might be in contravention of all the aphorisms ofHippocrates. With this the governor was satisfied and looked forward tothe approach of night and supper-time with great anxiety; and though time,to his mind, stood still and made no progress, nevertheless the hour he solonged for came, and they gave him a beef salad with onions and someboiled calves&rsquo; feet rather far gone. At this he fell to with greaterrelish than if they had given him francolins from Milan, pheasants fromRome, veal from Sorrento, partridges from Moron, or geese from Lavajos,and turning to the doctor at supper he said to him, &ldquo;Look here,señor doctor, for the future don&rsquo;t trouble yourself about giving medainty things or choice dishes to eat, for it will be only taking mystomach off its hinges; it is accustomed to goat, cow, bacon, hung beef,turnips and onions; and if by any chance it is given these palace dishes,it receives them squeamishly, and sometimes with loathing. What thehead-carver had best do is to serve me with what they call ollas podridas(and the rottener they are the better they smell); and he can put whateverhe likes into them, so long as it is good to eat, and I&rsquo;ll beobliged to him, and will requite him some day. But let nobody play prankson me, for either we are or we are not; let us live and eat in peace andgood-fellowship, for when God sends the dawn, he sends it for all. I meanto govern this island without giving up a right or taking a bribe; leteveryone keep his eye open, and look out for the arrow; for I can tellthem &lsquo;the devil&rsquo;s in Cantillana,&rsquo; and if they drive meto it they&rsquo;ll see something that will astonish them. Nay! makeyourself honey and the flies eat you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of a truth, señor governor,&rdquo; said the carver, &ldquo;yourworship is in the right of it in everything you have said; and I promiseyou in the name of all the inhabitants of this island that they will serveyour worship with all zeal, affection, and good-will, for the mild kind ofgovernment you have given a sample of to begin with, leaves them no groundfor doing or thinking anything to your worship&rsquo;s disadvantage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I believe,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;and they would be greatfools if they did or thought otherwise; once more I say, see to my feedingand my Dapple&rsquo;s for that is the great point and what is most to thepurpose; and when the hour comes let us go the rounds, for it is myintention to purge this island of all manner of uncleanness and of allidle good-for-nothing vagabonds; for I would have you know that lazyidlers are the same thing in a State as the drones in a hive, that eat upthe honey the industrious bees make. I mean to protect the husbandman, topreserve to the gentleman his privileges, to reward the virtuous, andabove all to respect religion and honour its ministers. What say you tothat, my friends? Is there anything in what I say, or am I talking to nopurpose?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is so much in what your worship says, señor governor,&rdquo;said the majordomo, &ldquo;that I am filled with wonder when I see a manlike your worship, entirely without learning (for I believe you have noneat all), say such things, and so full of sound maxims and sage remarks,very different from what was expected of your worship&rsquo;s intelligenceby those who sent us or by us who came here. Every day we see somethingnew in this world; jokes become realities, and the jokers find the tablesturned upon them.&rdquo;</p><p>Night came, and with the permission of Doctor Pedro Recio, the governorhad supper. They then got ready to go the rounds, and he started with themajordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, the chronicler charged withrecording his deeds, and alguacils and notaries enough to form afair-sized squadron. In the midst marched Sancho with his staff, as fine asight as one could wish to see, and but a few streets of the town had beentraversed when they heard a noise as of a clashing of swords. Theyhastened to the spot, and found that the combatants were but two, whoseeing the authorities approaching stood still, and one of them exclaimed,&ldquo;Help, in the name of God and the king! Are men to be allowed to robin the middle of this town, and rush out and attack people in the verystreets?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be calm, my good man,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and tell me whatthe cause of this quarrel is; for I am the governor.&rdquo;</p><p>Said the other combatant, &ldquo;Señor governor, I will tell you in a veryfew words. Your worship must know that this gentleman has just now wonmore than a thousand reals in that gambling house opposite, and God knowshow. I was there, and gave more than one doubtful point in his favour,very much against what my conscience told me. He made off with hiswinnings, and when I made sure he was going to give me a crown or so atleast by way of a present, as it is usual and customary to give men ofquality of my sort who stand by to see fair or foul play, and back upswindles, and prevent quarrels, he pocketed his money and left the house.Indignant at this I followed him, and speaking to him fairly and civillyasked him to give me if it were only eight reals, for he knows I am anhonest man and that I have neither profession nor property, for my parentsnever brought me up to any or left me any; but the rogue, who is a greaterthief than Cacus and a greater sharper than Andradilla, would not give memore than four reals; so your worship may see how little shame andconscience he has. But by my faith if you had not come up I&rsquo;d havemade him disgorge his winnings, and he&rsquo;d have learned what the rangeof the steel-yard was.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What say you to this?&rdquo; asked Sancho. The other replied thatall his antagonist said was true, and that he did not choose to give himmore than four reals because he very often gave him money; and that thosewho expected presents ought to be civil and take what is given them with acheerful countenance, and not make any claim against winners unless theyknow them for certain to be sharpers and their winnings to be unfairlywon; and that there could be no better proof that he himself was an honestman than his having refused to give anything; for sharpers always paytribute to lookers-on who know them.</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the majordomo; &ldquo;let your worshipconsider what is to be done with these men.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is to be done,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;is this; you, thewinner, be you good, bad, or indifferent, give this assailant of yours ahundred reals at once, and you must disburse thirty more for the poorprisoners; and you who have neither profession nor property, and hangabout the island in idleness, take these hundred reals now, and some timeof the day to-morrow quit the island under sentence of banishment for tenyears, and under pain of completing it in another life if you violate thesentence, for I&rsquo;ll hang you on a gibbet, or at least the hangmanwill by my orders; not a word from either of you, or I&rsquo;ll make himfeel my hand.&rdquo;</p><p>The one paid down the money and the other took it, and the latter quittedthe island, while the other went home; and then the governor said, &ldquo;EitherI am not good for much, or I&rsquo;ll get rid of these gambling houses,for it strikes me they are very mischievous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This one at least,&rdquo; said one of the notaries, &ldquo;yourworship will not be able to get rid of, for a great man owns it, and whathe loses every year is beyond all comparison more than what he makes bythe cards. On the minor gambling houses your worship may exercise yourpower, and it is they that do most harm and shelter the most barefacedpractices; for in the houses of lords and gentlemen of quality thenotorious sharpers dare not attempt to play their tricks; and as the viceof gambling has become common, it is better that men should play in housesof repute than in some tradesman&rsquo;s, where they catch an unluckyfellow in the small hours of the morning and skin him alive.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know already, notary, that there is a good deal to be said onthat point,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>And now a tipstaff came up with a young man in his grasp, and said,&ldquo;Señor governor, this youth was coming towards us, and as soon as hesaw the officers of justice he turned about and ran like a deer, a sureproof that he must be some evil-doer; I ran after him, and had it not beenthat he stumbled and fell, I should never have caught him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did you run for, fellow?&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>To which the young man replied, &ldquo;Señor, it was to avoid answeringall the questions officers of justice put.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you by trade?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A weaver.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what do you weave?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lance heads, with your worship&rsquo;s good leave.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re facetious with me! You plume yourself on being a wag?Very good; and where were you going just now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To take the air, señor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And where does one take the air in this island?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where it blows.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good! your answers are very much to the point; you are a smartyouth; but take notice that I am the air, and that I blow upon youa-stern, and send you to gaol. Ho there! lay hold of him and take him off;I&rsquo;ll make him sleep there to-night without air.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;your worship will make mesleep in gaol just as soon as make me king.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why shan&rsquo;t I make thee sleep in gaol?&rdquo; said Sancho.&ldquo;Have I not the power to arrest thee and release thee whenever Ilike?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All the power your worship has,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;won&rsquo;tbe able to make me sleep in gaol.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How? not able!&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;take him away at oncewhere he&rsquo;ll see his mistake with his own eyes, even if the gaoler iswilling to exert his interested generosity on his behalf; for I&rsquo;lllay a penalty of two thousand ducats on him if he allows him to stir astep from the prison.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous,&rdquo; said the young man; &ldquo;the factis, all the men on earth will not make me sleep in prison.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, you devil,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;have you got anyangel that will deliver you, and take off the irons I am going to orderthem to put upon you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now, señor governor,&rdquo; said the young man in a sprightlymanner, &ldquo;let us be reasonable and come to the point. Granted yourworship may order me to be taken to prison, and to have irons and chainsput on me, and to be shut up in a cell, and may lay heavy penalties on thegaoler if he lets me out, and that he obeys your orders; still, if I don&rsquo;tchoose to sleep, and choose to remain awake all night without closing aneye, will your worship with all your power be able to make me sleep if Idon&rsquo;t choose?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, truly,&rdquo; said the secretary, &ldquo;and the fellow hasmade his point.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So then,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;it would be entirely of yourown choice you would keep from sleeping; not in opposition to my will?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, señor,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;certainly not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, go, and God be with you,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;beoff home to sleep, and God give you sound sleep, for I don&rsquo;t want torob you of it; but for the future, let me advise you don&rsquo;t joke withthe authorities, because you may come across someone who will bring downthe joke on your own skull.&rdquo;</p><p>The young man went his way, and the governor continued his round, andshortly afterwards two tipstaffs came up with a man in custody, and said,&ldquo;Señor governor, this person, who seems to be a man, is not so, buta woman, and not an ill-favoured one, in man&rsquo;s clothes.&rdquo; Theyraised two or three lanterns to her face, and by their light theydistinguished the features of a woman to all appearance of the age ofsixteen or a little more, with her hair gathered into a gold and greensilk net, and fair as a thousand pearls. They scanned her from head tofoot, and observed that she had on red silk stockings with garters ofwhite taffety bordered with gold and pearl; her breeches were of green andgold stuff, and under an open jacket or jerkin of the same she wore adoublet of the finest white and gold cloth; her shoes were white and suchas men wear; she carried no sword at her belt, but only a richlyornamented dagger, and on her fingers she had several handsome rings. Inshort, the girl seemed fair to look at in the eyes of all, and none ofthose who beheld her knew her, the people of the town said they could notimagine who she was, and those who were in on the secret of the jokes thatwere to be practised upon Sancho were the ones who were most surprised,for this incident or discovery had not been arranged by them; and theywatched anxiously to see how the affair would end.</p><p>Sancho was fascinated by the girl&rsquo;s beauty, and he asked her who shewas, where she was going, and what had induced her to dress herself inthat garb. She with her eyes fixed on the ground answered in modestconfusion, &ldquo;I cannot tell you, señor, before so many people what itis of such consequence to me to have kept secret; one thing I wish to beknown, that I am no thief or evildoer, but only an unhappy maiden whom thepower of jealousy has led to break through the respect that is due tomodesty.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing this the majordomo said to Sancho, &ldquo;Make the people standback, señor governor, that this lady may say what she wishes with lessembarrassment.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho gave the order, and all except the majordomo, the head-carver, andthe secretary fell back. Finding herself then in the presence of no more,the damsel went on to say, &ldquo;I am the daughter, sirs, of Pedro PerezMazorca, the wool-farmer of this town, who is in the habit of coming veryoften to my father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do, señora,&rdquo; said the majordomo; &ldquo;forI know Pedro Perez very well, and I know he has no child at all, eitherson or daughter; and besides, though you say he is your father, you addthen that he comes very often to your father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had already noticed that,&rdquo; said Sancho.</p><p>&ldquo;I am confused just now, sirs,&rdquo; said the damsel, &ldquo;and Idon&rsquo;t know what I am saying; but the truth is that I am the daughterof Diego de la Llana, whom you must all know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ay, that will do,&rdquo; said the majordomo; &ldquo;for I knowDiego de la Llana, and know that he is a gentleman of position and a richman, and that he has a son and a daughter, and that since he was left awidower nobody in all this town can speak of having seen his daughter&rsquo;sface; for he keeps her so closely shut up that he does not give even thesun a chance of seeing her; and for all that report says she is extremelybeautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said the damsel, &ldquo;and I am that daughter;whether report lies or not as to my beauty, you, sirs, will have decidedby this time, as you have seen me;&rdquo; and with this she began to weepbitterly.</p><p>On seeing this the secretary leant over to the head-carver&rsquo;s ear,and said to him in a low voice, &ldquo;Something serious has no doubthappened this poor maiden, that she goes wandering from home in such adress and at such an hour, and one of her rank too.&rdquo; &ldquo;Therecan be no doubt about it,&rdquo; returned the carver, &ldquo;and moreoverher tears confirm your suspicion.&rdquo; Sancho gave her the best comforthe could, and entreated her to tell them without any fear what hadhappened her, as they would all earnestly and by every means in theirpower endeavour to relieve her.</p><p>&ldquo;The fact is, sirs,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that my father has keptme shut up these ten years, for so long is it since the earth received mymother. Mass is said at home in a sumptuous chapel, and all this time Ihave seen but the sun in the heaven by day, and the moon and the stars bynight; nor do I know what streets are like, or plazas, or churches, oreven men, except my father and a brother I have, and Pedro Perez thewool-farmer; whom, because he came frequently to our house, I took it intomy head to call my father, to avoid naming my own. This seclusion and therestrictions laid upon my going out, were it only to church, have beenkeeping me unhappy for many a day and month past; I longed to see theworld, or at least the town where I was born, and it did not seem to methat this wish was inconsistent with the respect maidens of good qualityshould have for themselves. When I heard them talking of bull-fightstaking place, and of javelin games, and of acting plays, I asked mybrother, who is a year younger than myself, to tell me what sort of thingsthese were, and many more that I had never seen; he explained them to meas well as he could, but the only effect was to kindle in me a stillstronger desire to see them. At last, to cut short the story of my ruin, Ibegged and entreated my brother&mdash;O that I had never made such anentreaty&mdash;&rdquo; And once more she gave way to a burst of weeping.</p><p>&ldquo;Proceed, señora,&rdquo; said the majordomo, &ldquo;and finish yourstory of what has happened to you, for your words and tears are keeping usall in suspense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have but little more to say, though many a tear to shed,&rdquo;said the damsel; &ldquo;for ill-placed desires can only be paid for insome such way.&rdquo;</p><p>The maiden&rsquo;s beauty had made a deep impression on the head-carver&rsquo;sheart, and he again raised his lantern for another look at her, andthought they were not tears she was shedding, but seed-pearl or dew of themeadow, nay, he exalted them still higher, and made Oriental pearls ofthem, and fervently hoped her misfortune might not be so great a one asher tears and sobs seemed to indicate. The governor was losing patience atthe length of time the girl was taking to tell her story, and told her notto keep them waiting any longer; for it was late, and there still remaineda good deal of the town to be gone over.</p><p>She, with broken sobs and half-suppressed sighs, went on to say, &ldquo;Mymisfortune, my misadventure, is simply this, that I entreated my brotherto dress me up as a man in a suit of his clothes, and take me some night,when our father was asleep, to see the whole town; he, overcome by myentreaties, consented, and dressing me in this suit and himself in clothesof mine that fitted him as if made for him (for he has not a hair on hischin, and might pass for a very beautiful young girl), to-night, about anhour ago, more or less, we left the house, and guided by our youthful andfoolish impulse we made the circuit of the whole town, and then, as wewere about to return home, we saw a great troop of people coming, and mybrother said to me, &lsquo;Sister, this must be the round, stir your feetand put wings to them, and follow me as fast as you can, lest theyrecognise us, for that would be a bad business for us;&rsquo; and sosaying he turned about and began, I cannot say to run but to fly; in lessthan six paces I fell from fright, and then the officer of justice came upand carried me before your worships, where I find myself put to shamebefore all these people as whimsical and vicious.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So then, señora,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;no other mishap hasbefallen you, nor was it jealousy that made you leave home, as you said atthe beginning of your story?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing has happened me,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;nor was itjealousy that brought me out, but merely a longing to see the world, whichdid not go beyond seeing the streets of this town.&rdquo;</p><p>The appearance of the tipstaffs with her brother in custody, whom one ofthem had overtaken as he ran away from his sister, now fully confirmed thetruth of what the damsel said. He had nothing on but a rich petticoat anda short blue damask cloak with fine gold lace, and his head was uncoveredand adorned only with its own hair, which looked like rings of gold, sobright and curly was it. The governor, the majordomo, and the carver wentaside with him, and, unheard by his sister, asked him how he came to be inthat dress, and he with no less shame and embarrassment told exactly thesame story as his sister, to the great delight of the enamoured carver;the governor, however, said to them, &ldquo;In truth, young lady andgentleman, this has been a very childish affair, and to explain your follyand rashness there was no necessity for all this delay and all these tearsand sighs; for if you had said we are so-and-so, and we escaped from ourfather&rsquo;s house in this way in order to ramble about, out of merecuriosity and with no other object, there would have been an end of thematter, and none of these little sobs and tears and all the rest of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the damsel, &ldquo;but you see theconfusion I was in was so great it did not let me behave as I ought.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No harm has been done,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;come, we willleave you at your father&rsquo;s house; perhaps they will not have missedyou; and another time don&rsquo;t be so childish or eager to see theworld; for a respectable damsel should have a broken leg and keep at home;and the woman and the hen by gadding about are soon lost; and she who iseager to see is also eager to be seen; I say no more.&rdquo;</p><p>The youth thanked the governor for his kind offer to take them home, andthey directed their steps towards the house, which was not far off. Onreaching it the youth threw a pebble up at a grating, and immediately awoman-servant who was waiting for them came down and opened the door tothem, and they went in, leaving the party marvelling as much at theirgrace and beauty as at the fancy they had for seeing the world by nightand without quitting the village; which, however, they set down to theiryouth.</p><p>The head-carver was left with a heart pierced through and through, and hemade up his mind on the spot to demand the damsel in marriage of herfather on the morrow, making sure she would not be refused him as he was aservant of the duke&rsquo;s; and even to Sancho ideas and schemes ofmarrying the youth to his daughter Sanchica suggested themselves, and heresolved to open the negotiation at the proper season, persuading himselfthat no husband could be refused to a governor&rsquo;s daughter. And sothe night&rsquo;s round came to an end, and a couple of days later thegovernment, whereby all his plans were overthrown and swept away, as willbe seen farther on.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p49e" id="p49e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p49e.jpg (55K)" src="images/p49e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch50b" id="ch50b"></a>CHAPTER L.<br/>WHEREIN IS SET FORTH WHO THE ENCHANTERS AND EXECUTIONERS WERE WHO FLOGGEDTHE DUENNA AND PINCHED DON QUIXOTE, AND ALSO WHAT BEFELL THE PAGE WHOCARRIED THE LETTER TO TERESA PANZA, SANCHO PANZA&rsquo;S WIFE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p50a" id="p50a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p50a.jpg (104K)" src="images/p50a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p50a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Cide Hamete, the painstaking investigator of the minute points of thisveracious history, says that when Doña Rodriguez left her own room to goto Don Quixote&rsquo;s, another duenna who slept with her observed her,and as all duennas are fond of prying, listening, and sniffing, shefollowed her so silently that the good Rodriguez never perceived it; andas soon as the duenna saw her enter Don Quixote&rsquo;s room, not to failin a duenna&rsquo;s invariable practice of tattling, she hurried off thatinstant to report to the duchess how Doña Rodriguez was closeted with DonQuixote. The duchess told the duke, and asked him to let her andAltisidora go and see what the said duenna wanted with Don Quixote. Theduke gave them leave, and the pair cautiously and quietly crept to thedoor of the room and posted themselves so close to it that they could hearall that was said inside. But when the duchess heard how the Rodriguez hadmade public the Aranjuez of her issues she could not restrain herself, norAltisidora either; and so, filled with rage and thirsting for vengeance,they burst into the room and tormented Don Quixote and flogged the duennain the manner already described; for indignities offered to their charmsand self-esteem mightily provoke the anger of women and make them eagerfor revenge. The duchess told the duke what had happened, and he was muchamused by it; and she, in pursuance of her design of making merry anddiverting herself with Don Quixote, despatched the page who had played thepart of Dulcinea in the negotiations for her disenchantment (which SanchoPanza in the cares of government had forgotten all about) to Teresa Panzahis wife with her husband&rsquo;s letter and another from herself, andalso a great string of fine coral beads as a present.</p><p>Now the history says this page was very sharp and quick-witted; and eagerto serve his lord and lady he set off very willingly for Sancho&rsquo;svillage. Before he entered it he observed a number of women washing in abrook, and asked them if they could tell him whether there lived there awoman of the name of Teresa Panza, wife of one Sancho Panza, squire to aknight called Don Quixote of La Mancha. At the question a young girl whowas washing stood up and said, &ldquo;Teresa Panza is my mother, and thatSancho is my father, and that knight is our master.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then, miss,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;come and show mewhere your mother is, for I bring her a letter and a present from yourfather.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I will with all my heart, señor,&rdquo; said the girl, whoseemed to be about fourteen, more or less; and leaving the clothes she waswashing to one of her companions, and without putting anything on her heador feet, for she was bare-legged and had her hair hanging about her, awayshe skipped in front of the page&rsquo;s horse, saying, &ldquo;Come, yourworship, our house is at the entrance of the town, and my mother is there,sorrowful enough at not having had any news of my father this ever solong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;I am bringing her such good newsthat she will have reason to thank God.&rdquo;</p><p>And then, skipping, running, and capering, the girl reached the town, butbefore going into the house she called out at the door, &ldquo;Come out,mother Teresa, come out, come out; here&rsquo;s a gentleman with lettersand other things from my good father.&rdquo; At these words her motherTeresa Panza came out spinning a bundle of flax, in a grey petticoat (soshort was it one would have fancied &ldquo;they to her shame had cut itshort&rdquo;), a grey bodice of the same stuff, and a smock. She was notvery old, though plainly past forty, strong, healthy, vigorous, andsun-dried; and seeing her daughter and the page on horseback, sheexclaimed, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, child? What gentleman is this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A servant of my lady, Doña Teresa Panza,&rdquo; replied the page;and suiting the action to the word he flung himself off his horse, andwith great humility advanced to kneel before the lady Teresa, saying,&ldquo;Let me kiss your hand, Señora Doña Teresa, as the lawful and onlywife of Señor Don Sancho Panza, rightful governor of the island ofBarataria.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, señor, get up, do that,&rdquo; said Teresa; &ldquo;for I&rsquo;mnot a bit of a court lady, but only a poor country woman, the daughter ofa clodcrusher, and the wife of a squire-errant and not of any governor atall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;the most worthy wife of amost arch-worthy governor; and as a proof of what I say accept this letterand this present;&rdquo; and at the same time he took out of his pocket astring of coral beads with gold clasps, and placed it on her neck, andsaid, &ldquo;This letter is from his lordship the governor, and the otheras well as these coral beads from my lady the duchess, who sends me toyour worship.&rdquo;</p><p>Teresa stood lost in astonishment, and her daughter just as much, and thegirl said, &ldquo;May I die but our master Don Quixote&rsquo;s at thebottom of this; he must have given father the government or county he sooften promised him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the truth,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;for it is throughSeñor Don Quixote that Señor Sancho is now governor of the island ofBarataria, as will be seen by this letter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will your worship read it to me, noble sir?&rdquo; said Teresa;&ldquo;for though I can spin I can&rsquo;t read, not a scrap.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nor I either,&rdquo; said Sanchica; &ldquo;but wait a bit, and I&rsquo;llgo and fetch someone who can read it, either the curate himself or thebachelor Samson Carrasco, and they&rsquo;ll come gladly to hear any newsof my father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no need to fetch anybody,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;forthough I can&rsquo;t spin I can read, and I&rsquo;ll read it;&rdquo; andso he read it through, but as it has been already given it is not insertedhere; and then he took out the other one from the duchess, which ran asfollows:</p><p class="letter">Friend Teresa,&mdash;Your husband Sancho&rsquo;s good qualities, of heart aswell as of head, induced and compelled me to request my husband the duke togive him the government of one of his many islands. I am told he governs like agerfalcon, of which I am very glad, and my lord the duke, of course, also; andI am very thankful to heaven that I have not made a mistake in choosing him forthat same government; for I would have Señora Teresa know that a good governoris hard to find in this world and may God make me as good as Sancho&rsquo;s wayof governing. Herewith I send you, my dear, a string of coral beads with goldclasps; I wish they were Oriental pearls; but &ldquo;he who gives thee a bonedoes not wish to see thee dead;&rdquo; a time will come when we shall becomeacquainted and meet one another, but God knows the future. Commend me to yourdaughter Sanchica, and tell her from me to hold herself in readiness, for Imean to make a high match for her when she least expects it. They tell me thereare big acorns in your village; send me a couple of dozen or so, and I shallvalue them greatly as coming from your hand; and write to me at length toassure me of your health and well-being; and if there be anything you stand inneed of, it is but to open your mouth, and that shall be the measure; and soGod keep you.</p><p class="right">From this place.<br/>Your loving friend,<br/>THE DUCHESS.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, what a good, plain, lowly lady!&rdquo; said Teresa when sheheard the letter; &ldquo;that I may be buried with ladies of that sort,and not the gentlewomen we have in this town, that fancy because they aregentlewomen the wind must not touch them, and go to church with as muchairs as if they were queens, no less, and seem to think they are disgracedif they look at a farmer&rsquo;s wife! And see here how this good lady,for all she&rsquo;s a duchess, calls me &lsquo;friend,&rsquo; and treatsme as if I was her equal&mdash;and equal may I see her with the tallestchurch-tower in La Mancha! And as for the acorns, señor, I&rsquo;ll sendher ladyship a peck and such big ones that one might come to see them as ashow and a wonder. And now, Sanchica, see that the gentleman iscomfortable; put up his horse, and get some eggs out of the stable, andcut plenty of bacon, and let&rsquo;s give him his dinner like a prince;for the good news he has brought, and his own bonny face deserve it all;and meanwhile I&rsquo;ll run out and give the neighbours the news of ourgood luck, and father curate, and Master Nicholas the barber, who are andalways have been such friends of thy father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I will, mother,&rdquo; said Sanchica; &ldquo;but mind, youmust give me half of that string; for I don&rsquo;t think my lady theduchess could have been so stupid as to send it all to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is all for thee, my child,&rdquo; said Teresa; &ldquo;but let mewear it round my neck for a few days; for verily it seems to make my heartglad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will be glad too,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;when you see thebundle there is in this portmanteau, for it is a suit of the finest cloth,that the governor only wore one day out hunting and now sends, all forSeñora Sanchica.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May he live a thousand years,&rdquo; said Sanchica, &ldquo;and thebearer as many, nay two thousand, if needful.&rdquo;</p><p>With this Teresa hurried out of the house with the letters, and with thestring of beads round her neck, and went along thrumming the letters as ifthey were a tambourine, and by chance coming across the curate and SamsonCarrasco she began capering and saying, &ldquo;None of us poor now, faith!We&rsquo;ve got a little government! Ay, let the finest fine lady tackleme, and I&rsquo;ll give her a setting down!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this, Teresa Panza,&rdquo; said they; &ldquo;whatmadness is this, and what papers are those?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The madness is only this,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that these arethe letters of duchesses and governors, and these I have on my neck arefine coral beads, with ave-marias and paternosters of beaten gold, and Iam a governess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God help us,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;tunderstand you, Teresa, or know what you are talking about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There, you may see it yourselves,&rdquo; said Teresa, and shehanded them the letters.</p><p>The curate read them out for Samson Carrasco to hear, and Samson and heregarded one another with looks of astonishment at what they had read, andthe bachelor asked who had brought the letters. Teresa in reply bade themcome with her to her house and they would see the messenger, a mostelegant youth, who had brought another present which was worth as muchmore. The curate took the coral beads from her neck and examined themagain and again, and having satisfied himself as to their fineness he fellto wondering afresh, and said, &ldquo;By the gown I wear I don&rsquo;tknow what to say or think of these letters and presents; on the one hand Ican see and feel the fineness of these coral beads, and on the other Iread how a duchess sends to beg for a couple of dozen of acorns.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Square that if you can,&rdquo; said Carrasco; &ldquo;well, let&rsquo;sgo and see the messenger, and from him we&rsquo;ll learn something aboutthis mystery that has turned up.&rdquo;</p><p>They did so, and Teresa returned with them. They found the page sifting alittle barley for his horse, and Sanchica cutting a rasher of bacon to bepaved with eggs for his dinner. His looks and his handsome apparel pleasedthem both greatly; and after they had saluted him courteously, and hethem, Samson begged him to give them his news, as well of Don Quixote asof Sancho Panza, for, he said, though they had read the letters fromSancho and her ladyship the duchess, they were still puzzled and could notmake out what was meant by Sancho&rsquo;s government, and above all of anisland, when all or most of those in the Mediterranean belonged to hisMajesty.</p><p>To this the page replied, &ldquo;As to Señor Sancho Panza&rsquo;s being agovernor there is no doubt whatever; but whether it is an island or notthat he governs, with that I have nothing to do; suffice it that it is atown of more than a thousand inhabitants; with regard to the acorns I maytell you my lady the duchess is so unpretending and unassuming that, notto speak of sending to beg for acorns from a peasant woman, she has beenknown to send to ask for the loan of a comb from one of her neighbours;for I would have your worships know that the ladies of Aragon, though theyare just as illustrious, are not so punctilious and haughty as theCastilian ladies; they treat people with greater familiarity.&rdquo;</p><p>In the middle of this conversation Sanchica came in with her skirt full ofeggs, and said she to the page, &ldquo;Tell me, señor, does my father weartrunk-hose since he has been governor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have not noticed,&rdquo; said the page; &ldquo;but no doubt hewears them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! my God!&rdquo; said Sanchica, &ldquo;what a sight it must be tosee my father in tights! Isn&rsquo;t it odd that ever since I was born Ihave had a longing to see my father in trunk-hose?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As things go you will see that if you live,&rdquo; said the page;&ldquo;by God he is in the way to take the road with a sunshade if thegovernment only lasts him two months more.&rdquo;</p><p>The curate and the bachelor could see plainly enough that the page spokein a waggish vein; but the fineness of the coral beads, and the huntingsuit that Sancho sent (for Teresa had already shown it to them) did awaywith the impression; and they could not help laughing at Sanchica&rsquo;swish, and still more when Teresa said, &ldquo;Señor curate, look about ifthere&rsquo;s anybody here going to Madrid or Toledo, to buy me a hoopedpetticoat, a proper fashionable one of the best quality; for indeed andindeed I must do honour to my husband&rsquo;s government as well as I can;nay, if I am put to it and have to, I&rsquo;ll go to Court and set a coachlike all the world; for she who has a governor for her husband may verywell have one and keep one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And why not, mother!&rdquo; said Sanchica; &ldquo;would to God itwere to-day instead of to-morrow, even though they were to say when theysaw me seated in the coach with my mother, &lsquo;See that rubbish, thatgarlic-stuffed fellow&rsquo;s daughter, how she goes stretched at her easein a coach as if she was a she-pope!&rsquo; But let them tramp through themud, and let me go in my coach with my feet off the ground. Bad luck tobackbiters all over the world; &lsquo;let me go warm and the people maylaugh.&rsquo; Do I say right, mother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To be sure you do, my child,&rdquo; said Teresa; &ldquo;and allthis good luck, and even more, my good Sancho foretold me; and thou wiltsee, my daughter, he won&rsquo;t stop till he has made me a countess; forto make a beginning is everything in luck; and as I have heard thy goodfather say many a time (for besides being thy father he&rsquo;s the fatherof proverbs too), &lsquo;When they offer thee a heifer, run with a halter;when they offer thee a government, take it; when they would give thee acounty, seize it; when they say, &ldquo;Here, here!&rdquo; to thee withsomething good, swallow it.&rsquo; Oh no! go to sleep, and don&rsquo;tanswer the strokes of good fortune and the lucky chances that are knockingat the door of your house!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what do I care,&rdquo; added Sanchica, &ldquo;whether anybodysays when he sees me holding my head up, &lsquo;The dog saw himself inhempen breeches,&rsquo; and the rest of it?&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing this the curate said, &ldquo;I do believe that all this family ofthe Panzas are born with a sackful of proverbs in their insides, every oneof them; I never saw one of them that does not pour them out at all timesand on all occasions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the page, &ldquo;for Señor GovernorSancho utters them at every turn; and though a great many of them are notto the purpose, still they amuse one, and my lady the duchess and the dukepraise them highly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then you still maintain that all this about Sancho&rsquo;sgovernment is true, señor,&rdquo; said the bachelor, &ldquo;and that thereactually is a duchess who sends him presents and writes to him?

Thebachelor offered to write the letters in reply for Teresa; but she did notcare to let him mix himself up in her affairs, for she thought himsomewhat given to joking; and so she gave a cake and a couple of eggs to ayoung acolyte who was a penman, and he wrote for her two letters, one forher husband and the other for the duchess, dictated out of her own head,which are not the worst inserted in this great history, as will be seenfarther on.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p50e" id="p50e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p50e.jpg (19K)" src="images/p50e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch51b" id="ch51b"></a>CHAPTER LI.<br/>OF THE PROGRESS OF SANCHO&rsquo;S GOVERNMENT, AND OTHER SUCH ENTERTAININGMATTERS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p51a" id="p51a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p51a.jpg (188K)" src="images/p51a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p51a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Day came after the night of the governor&rsquo;s round; a night which thehead-carver passed without sleeping, so were his thoughts of the face andair and beauty of the disguised damsel, while the majordomo spent what wasleft of it in writing an account to his lord and lady of all Sancho saidand did, being as much amazed at his sayings as at his doings, for therewas a mixture of shrewdness and simplicity in all his words and deeds. Theseñor governor got up, and by Doctor Pedro Recio&rsquo;s directions theymade him break his fast on a little conserve and four sups of cold water,which Sancho would have readily exchanged for a piece of bread and a bunchof grapes; but seeing there was no help for it, he submitted with nolittle sorrow of heart and discomfort of stomach; Pedro Recio havingpersuaded him that light and delicate diet enlivened the wits, and thatwas what was most essential for persons placed in command and inresponsible situations, where they have to employ not only the bodilypowers but those of the mind also.</p><p>By means of this sophistry Sancho was made to endure hunger, and hunger sokeen that in his heart he cursed the government, and even him who hadgiven it to him; however, with his hunger and his conserve he undertook todeliver judgments that day, and the first thing that came before him was aquestion that was submitted to him by a stranger, in the presence of themajordomo and the other attendants, and it was in these words: &ldquo;Señor,a large river separated two districts of one and the same lordship&mdash;willyour worship please to pay attention, for the case is an important and arather knotty one? Well then, on this river there was a bridge, and at oneend of it a gallows, and a sort of tribunal, where four judges commonlysat to administer the law which the lord of river, bridge and the lordshiphad enacted, and which was to this effect, &lsquo;If anyone crosses bythis bridge from one side to the other he shall declare on oath where heis going to and with what object; and if he swears truly, he shall beallowed to pass, but if falsely, he shall be put to death for it byhanging on the gallows erected there, without any remission.&rsquo; Thoughthe law and its severe penalty were known, many persons crossed, but intheir declarations it was easy to see at once they were telling the truth,and the judges let them pass free. It happened, however, that one man,when they came to take his declaration, swore and said that by the oath hetook he was going to die upon that gallows that stood there, and nothingelse. The judges held a consultation over the oath, and they said, &lsquo;Ifwe let this man pass free he has sworn falsely, and by the law he ought todie; but if we hang him, as he swore he was going to die on that gallows,and therefore swore the truth, by the same law he ought to go free.&rsquo;It is asked of your worship, señor governor, what are the judges to dowith this man? For they are still in doubt and perplexity; and havingheard of your worship&rsquo;s acute and exalted intellect, they have sentme to entreat your worship on their behalf to give your opinion on thisvery intricate and puzzling case.&rdquo;</p><p>To this Sancho made answer, &ldquo;Indeed those gentlemen the judges thatsend you to me might have spared themselves the trouble, for I have moreof the obtuse than the acute in me; but repeat the case over again, sothat I may understand it, and then perhaps I may be able to hit the point.&rdquo;</p><p>The querist repeated again and again what he had said before, and thenSancho said, &ldquo;It seems to me I can set the matter right in a moment,and in this way; the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows;but if he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the law enacteddeserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don&rsquo;t hanghim, then he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be hanged.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is as the señor governor says,&rdquo; said the messenger;&ldquo;and as regards a complete comprehension of the case, there isnothing left to desire or hesitate about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then I say,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that of this man theyshould let pass the part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that haslied; and in this way the conditions of the passage will be fully compliedwith.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But then, señor governor,&rdquo; replied the querist, &ldquo;theman will have to be divided into two parts; and if he is divided of coursehe will die; and so none of the requirements of the law will be carriedout, and it is absolutely necessary to comply with it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look here, my good sir,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;either I&rsquo;ma numskull or else there is the same reason for this passenger dying asfor his living and passing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him thefalsehood equally condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinionyou should say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the argumentsfor condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they shouldlet him pass freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than todo evil; this I would give signed with my name if I knew how to sign; andwhat I have said in this case is not out of my own head, but one of themany precepts my master Don Quixote gave me the night before I left tobecome governor of this island, that came into my mind, and it was this,that when there was any doubt about the justice of a case I should lean tomercy; and it is God&rsquo;s will that I should recollect it now, for itfits this case as if it was made for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the majordomo; &ldquo;and I maintain thatLycurgus himself, who gave laws to the Lacedemonians, could not havepronounced a better decision than the great Panza has given; let themorning&rsquo;s audience close with this, and I will see that the señorgovernor has dinner entirely to his liking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I ask for&mdash;fair play,&rdquo; said Sancho;&ldquo;give me my dinner, and then let it rain cases and questions on me,and I&rsquo;ll despatch them in a twinkling.&rdquo;</p><p>The majordomo kept his word, for he felt it against his conscience to killso wise a governor by hunger; particularly as he intended to have donewith him that same night, playing off the last joke he was commissioned topractise upon him.</p><p>It came to pass, then, that after he had dined that day, in opposition tothe rules and aphorisms of Doctor Tirteafuera, as they were taking awaythe cloth there came a courier with a letter from Don Quixote for thegovernor. Sancho ordered the secretary to read it to himself, and if therewas nothing in it that demanded secrecy to read it aloud. The secretarydid so, and after he had skimmed the contents he said, &ldquo;It may wellbe read aloud, for what Señor Don Quixote writes to your worship deservesto be printed or written in letters of gold, and it is as follows.&rdquo;</p><p class="center">DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA&rsquo;S LETTER TO SANCHO PANZA, GOVERNOR OF THEISLAND OF BARATARIA.</p><p class="letter">When I was expecting to hear of thy stupidities and blunders, friend Sancho, Ihave received intelligence of thy displays of good sense, for which I givespecial thanks to heaven that can raise the poor from the dunghill and of foolsto make wise men. They tell me thou dost govern as if thou wert a man, and arta man as if thou wert a beast, so great is the humility wherewith thou dostcomport thyself. But I would have thee bear in mind, Sancho, that very often itis fitting and necessary for the authority of office to resist the humility ofthe heart; for the seemly array of one who is invested with grave duties shouldbe such as they require and not measured by what his own humble tastes may leadhim to prefer. Dress well; a stick dressed up does not look like a stick; I donot say thou shouldst wear trinkets or fine raiment, or that being a judge thoushouldst dress like a soldier, but that thou shouldst array thyself in theapparel thy office requires, and that at the same time it be neat and handsome.To win the good-will of the people thou governest there are two things, amongothers, that thou must do; one is to be civil to all (this, however, I toldthee before), and the other to take care that food be abundant, for there isnothing that vexes the heart of the poor more than hunger and high prices. Makenot many proclamations; but those thou makest take care that they be good ones,and above all that they be observed and carried out; for proclamations that arenot observed are the same as if they did not exist; nay, they encourage theidea that the prince who had the wisdom and authority to make them had not thepower to enforce them; and laws that threaten and are not enforced come to belike the log, the king of the frogs, that frightened them at first, but that intime they despised and mounted upon. Be a father to virtue and a stepfather tovice. Be not always strict, nor yet always lenient, but observe a mean betweenthese two extremes, for in that is the aim of wisdom. Visit the gaols, theslaughter-houses, and the market-places; for the presence of the governor is ofgreat importance in such places; it comforts the prisoners who are in hopes ofa speedy release, it is the bugbear of the butchers who have then to give justweight, and it is the terror of the market-women for the same reason. Let itnot be seen that thou art (even if perchance thou art, which I do not believe)covetous, a follower of women, or a glutton; for when the people and those thathave dealings with thee become aware of thy special weakness they will bringtheir batteries to bear upon thee in that quarter, till they have brought theedown to the depths of perdition. Consider and reconsider, con and con overagain the advices and the instructions I gave thee before thy departure henceto thy government, and thou wilt see that in them, if thou dost follow them,thou hast a help at hand that will lighten for thee the troubles anddifficulties that beset governors at every step. Write to thy lord and lady andshow thyself grateful to them, for ingratitude is the daughter of pride, andone of the greatest sins we know of; and he who is grateful to those who havebeen good to him shows that he will be so to God also who has bestowed andstill bestows so many blessings upon him.<br/>    My lady the duchess sent off a messenger with thy suit and another presentto thy wife Teresa Panza; we expect the answer every moment. I have been alittle indisposed through a certain scratching I came in for, not very much tothe benefit of my nose; but it was nothing; for if there are enchanters whomaltreat me, there are also some who defend me. Let me know if the majordomowho is with thee had any share in the Trifaldi performance, as thou didstsuspect; and keep me informed of everything that happens thee, as the distanceis so short; all the more as I am thinking of giving over very shortly thisidle life I am now leading, for I was not born for it. A thing has occurred tome which I am inclined to think will put me out of favour with the duke andduchess; but though I am sorry for it I do not care, for after all I must obeymy calling rather than their pleasure, in accordance with the common saying,<i>amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas</i>. I quote this Latin to theebecause I conclude that since thou hast been a governor thou wilt have learnedit. Adieu; God keep thee from being an object of pity to anyone.</p><p class="right">Thy friend,<br/>DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA.</p><p>Sancho listened to the letter with great attention, and it was praised andconsidered wise by all who heard it; he then rose up from table, andcalling his secretary shut himself in with him in his own room, andwithout putting it off any longer set about answering his master DonQuixote at once; and he bade the secretary write down what he told himwithout adding or suppressing anything, which he did, and the answer wasto the following effect.</p><p class="center">SANCHO PANZA&rsquo;S LETTER TO DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA.</p><p class="letter">The pressure of business is so great upon me that I have no time to scratch myhead or even to cut my nails; and I have them so long&mdash;God send a remedyfor it. I say this, master of my soul, that you may not be surprised if I havenot until now sent you word of how I fare, well or ill, in this government, inwhich I am suffering more hunger than when we two were wandering through thewoods and wastes.<br/>    My lord the duke wrote to me the other day to warn me that certain spies hadgot into this island to kill me; but up to the present I have not found out anyexcept a certain doctor who receives a salary in this town for killing all thegovernors that come here; he is called Doctor Pedro Recio, and is fromTirteafuera; so you see what a name he has to make me dread dying under hishands. This doctor says of himself that he does not cure diseases when thereare any, but prevents them coming, and the medicines he uses are diet and morediet until he brings one down to bare bones; as if leanness was not worse thanfever.<br/>    In short he is killing me with hunger, and I am dying myself of vexation; forwhen I thought I was coming to this government to get my meat hot and my drinkcool, and take my ease between holland sheets on feather beds, I find I havecome to do penance as if I was a hermit; and as I don&rsquo;t do it willingly Isuspect that in the end the devil will carry me off.<br/>    So far I have not handled any dues or taken any bribes, and I don&rsquo;t knowwhat to think of it; for here they tell me that the governors that come to thisisland, before entering it have plenty of money either given to them or lent tothem by the people of the town, and that this is the usual custom not only herebut with all who enter upon governments.<br/>    Last night going the rounds I came upon a fair damsel in man&rsquo;s clothes,and a brother of hers dressed as a woman; my head-carver has fallen in lovewith the girl, and has in his own mind chosen her for a wife, so he says, and Ihave chosen the youth for a son-in-law; to-day we are going to explain ourintentions to the father of the pair, who is one Diego de la Llana, a gentlemanand an old Christian as much as you please.<br/>    I have visited the market-places, as your worship advises me, and yesterday Ifound a stall-keeper selling new hazel nuts and proved her to have mixed abushel of old empty rotten nuts with a bushel of new; I confiscated the wholefor the children of the charity-school, who will know how to distinguish themwell enough, and I sentenced her not to come into the market-place for afortnight; they told me I did bravely. I can tell your worship it is commonlysaid in this town that there are no people worse than the market-women, forthey are all barefaced, unconscionable, and impudent, and I can well believe itfrom what I have seen of them in other towns.<br/>    I am very glad my lady the duchess has written to my wife Teresa Panza and senther the present your worship speaks of; and I will strive to show myselfgrateful when the time comes; kiss her hands for me, and tell her I say she hasnot thrown it into a sack with a hole in it, as she will see in the end. Ishould not like your worship to have any difference with my lord and lady; forif you fall out with them it is plain it must do me harm; and as you give meadvice to be grateful it will not do for your worship not to be so yourself tothose who have shown you such kindness, and by whom you have been treated sohospitably in their castle.<br/>    That about the scratching I don&rsquo;t understand; but I suppose it must beone of the ill-turns the wicked enchanters are always doing your worship; whenwe meet I shall know all about it. I wish I could send your worship something;but I don&rsquo;t know what to send, unless it be some very curious clysterpipes, to work with bladders, that they make in this island; but if the officeremains with me I&rsquo;ll find out something to send, one way or another. Ifmy wife Teresa Panza writes to me, pay the postage and send me the letter, forI have a very great desire to hear how my house and wife and children are goingon. And so, may God deliver your worship from evil-minded enchanters, and bringme well and peacefully out of this government, which I doubt, for I expect totake leave of it and my life together, from the way Doctor Pedro Recio treatsme.</p><p class="right">Your worship&rsquo;s servant<br/>SANCHO PANZA THE GOVERNOR.</p><p>The secretary sealed the letter, and immediately dismissed the courier;and those who were carrying on the joke against Sancho putting their headstogether arranged how he was to be dismissed from the government. Sanchospent the afternoon in drawing up certain ordinances relating to the goodgovernment of what he fancied the island; and he ordained that there wereto be no provision hucksters in the State, and that men might import wineinto it from any place they pleased, provided they declared the quarter itcame from, so that a price might be put upon it according to its quality,reputation, and the estimation it was held in; and he that watered hiswine, or changed the name, was to forfeit his life for it. He reduced theprices of all manner of shoes, boots, and stockings, but of shoes inparticular, as they seemed to him to run extravagantly high. Heestablished a fixed rate for servants&rsquo; wages, which were becomingrecklessly exorbitant. He laid extremely heavy penalties upon those whosang lewd or loose songs either by day or night. He decreed that no blindman should sing of any miracle in verse, unless he could produce authenticevidence that it was true, for it was his opinion that most of those theblind men sing are trumped up, to the detriment of the true ones. Heestablished and created an alguacil of the poor, not to harass them, butto examine them and see whether they really were so; for many a sturdythief or drunkard goes about under cover of a make-believe crippled limbor a sham sore. In a word, he made so many good rules that to this daythey are preserved there, and are called <i>The constitutions of the greatgovernor Sancho Panza</i>.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p51e" id="p51e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p51e.jpg (32K)" src="images/p51e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch52b" id="ch52b"></a>CHAPTER LII.<br/>WHEREIN IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND DISTRESSED OR AFFLICTEDDUENNA, OTHERWISE CALLED DOÑA RODRIGUEZ</h3><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p52a" id="p52a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p52a.jpg (131K)" src="images/p52a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p52a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Cide Hamete relates that Don Quixote being now cured of his scratches feltthat the life he was leading in the castle was entirely inconsistent withthe order of chivalry he professed, so he determined to ask the duke andduchess to permit him to take his departure for Saragossa, as the time ofthe festival was now drawing near, and he hoped to win there the suit ofarmour which is the prize at festivals of the sort. But one day at tablewith the duke and duchess, just as he was about to carry his resolutioninto effect and ask for their permission, lo and behold suddenly therecame in through the door of the great hall two women, as they afterwardsproved to be, draped in mourning from head to foot, one of whomapproaching Don Quixote flung herself at full length at his feet, pressingher lips to them, and uttering moans so sad, so deep, and so doleful thatshe put all who heard and saw her into a state of perplexity; and thoughthe duke and duchess supposed it must be some joke their servants wereplaying off upon Don Quixote, still the earnest way the woman sighed andmoaned and wept puzzled them and made them feel uncertain, until DonQuixote, touched with compassion, raised her up and made her unveilherself and remove the mantle from her tearful face. She complied anddisclosed what no one could have ever anticipated, for she disclosed thecountenance of Doña Rodriguez, the duenna of the house; the other femalein mourning being her daughter, who had been made a fool of by the richfarmer&rsquo;s son. All who knew her were filled with astonishment, andthe duke and duchess more than any; for though they thought her asimpleton and a weak creature, they did not think her capable of crazypranks. Doña Rodriguez, at length, turning to her master and mistress saidto them, &ldquo;Will your excellences be pleased to permit me to speak tothis gentleman for a moment, for it is requisite I should do so in orderto get successfully out of the business in which the boldness of anevil-minded clown has involved me?&rdquo;</p><p>The duke said that for his part he gave her leave, and that she mightspeak with Señor Don Quixote as much as she liked.</p><p>She then, turning to Don Quixote and addressing herself to him said,&ldquo;Some days since, valiant knight, I gave you an account of theinjustice and treachery of a wicked farmer to my dearly beloved daughter,the unhappy damsel here before you, and you promised me to take her partand right the wrong that has been done her; but now it has come to myhearing that you are about to depart from this castle in quest of suchfair adventures as God may vouchsafe to you; therefore, before you takethe road, I would that you challenge this froward rustic, and compel himto marry my daughter in fulfillment of the promise he gave her to becomeher husband before he seduced her; for to expect that my lord the dukewill do me justice is to ask pears from the elm tree, for the reason Istated privately to your worship; and so may our Lord grant you goodhealth and forsake us not.&rdquo;</p><p>To these words Don Quixote replied very gravely and solemnly, &ldquo;Worthyduenna, check your tears, or rather dry them, and spare your sighs, for Itake it upon myself to obtain redress for your daughter, for whom it wouldhave been better not to have been so ready to believe lovers&rsquo;promises, which are for the most part quickly made and very slowlyperformed; and so, with my lord the duke&rsquo;s leave, I will at once goin quest of this inhuman youth, and will find him out and challenge himand slay him, if so be he refuses to keep his promised word; for the chiefobject of my profession is to spare the humble and chastise the proud; Imean, to help the distressed and destroy the oppressors.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no necessity,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;for yourworship to take the trouble of seeking out the rustic of whom this worthyduenna complains, nor is there any necessity, either, for asking my leaveto challenge him; for I admit him duly challenged, and will take care thathe is informed of the challenge, and accepts it, and comes to answer it inperson to this castle of mine, where I shall afford to both a fair field,observing all the conditions which are usually and properly observed insuch trials, and observing too justice to both sides, as all princes whooffer a free field to combatants within the limits of their lordships arebound to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then with that assurance and your highness&rsquo;s good leave,&rdquo;said Don Quixote, &ldquo;I hereby for this once waive my privilege ofgentle blood, and come down and put myself on a level with the lowly birthof the wrong-doer, making myself equal with him and enabling him to enterinto combat with me; and so, I challenge and defy him, though absent, onthe plea of his malfeasance in breaking faith with this poor damsel, whowas a maiden and now by his misdeed is none; and say that he shall fulfillthe promise he gave her to become her lawful husband, or else stake hislife upon the question.&rdquo;</p><p>And then plucking off a glove he threw it down in the middle of the hall,and the duke picked it up, saying, as he had said before, that he acceptedthe challenge in the name of his vassal, and fixed six days thence as thetime, the courtyard of the castle as the place, and for arms the customaryones of knights, lance and shield and full armour, with all the otheraccessories, without trickery, guile, or charms of any sort, and examinedand passed by the judges of the field. &ldquo;But first of all,&rdquo; hesaid, &ldquo;it is requisite that this worthy duenna and unworthy damselshould place their claim for justice in the hands of Don Quixote; forotherwise nothing can be done, nor can the said challenge be brought to alawful issue.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do so place it,&rdquo; replied the duenna.</p><p>&ldquo;And I too,&rdquo; added her daughter, all in tears and covered withshame and confusion.</p><p>This declaration having been made, and the duke having settled in his ownmind what he would do in the matter, the ladies in black withdrew, and theduchess gave orders that for the future they were not to be treated asservants of hers, but as lady adventurers who came to her house to demandjustice; so they gave them a room to themselves and waited on them as theywould on strangers, to the consternation of the other women-servants, whodid not know where the folly and imprudence of Doña Rodriguez and herunlucky daughter would stop.</p><p>And now, to complete the enjoyment of the feast and bring the dinner to asatisfactory end, lo and behold the page who had carried the letters andpresents to Teresa Panza, the wife of the governor Sancho, entered thehall; and the duke and duchess were very well pleased to see him, beinganxious to know the result of his journey; but when they asked him thepage said in reply that he could not give it before so many people or in afew words, and begged their excellences to be pleased to let it wait for aprivate opportunity, and in the meantime amuse themselves with theseletters; and taking out the letters he placed them in the duchess&rsquo;shand. One bore by way of address, <i>Letter for my lady the DuchessSo-and-so, of I don&rsquo;t know where; and the other To my husband SanchoPanza, governor of the island of Barataria, whom God prosper longer thanme</i>. The duchess&rsquo;s bread would not bake, as the saying is, until shehad read her letter; and having looked over it herself and seen that itmight be read aloud for the duke and all present to hear, she read out asfollows.</p><p class="center">TERESA PANZA&rsquo;S LETTER TO THE DUCHESS.</p><p class="letter">The letter your highness wrote me, my lady, gave me great pleasure, for indeedI found it very welcome. The string of coral beads is very fine, and myhusband&rsquo;s hunting suit does not fall short of it. All this village isvery much pleased that your ladyship has made a governor of my good man Sancho;though nobody will believe it, particularly the curate, and Master Nicholas thebarber, and the bachelor Samson Carrasco; but I don&rsquo;t care for that, forso long as it is true, as it is, they may all say what they like; though, totell the truth, if the coral beads and the suit had not come I would not havebelieved it either; for in this village everybody thinks my husband a numskull,and except for governing a flock of goats, they cannot fancy what sort ofgovernment he can be fit for. God grant it, and direct him according as he seeshis children stand in need of it. I am resolved with your worship&rsquo;sleave, lady of my soul, to make the most of this fair day, and go to Court tostretch myself at ease in a coach, and make all those I have envying me alreadyburst their eyes out; so I beg your excellence to order my husband to send me asmall trifle of money, and to let it be something to speak of, becauseone&rsquo;s expenses are heavy at the Court; for a loaf costs a real, and meatthirty maravedis a pound, which is beyond everything; and if he does not wantme to go let him tell me in time, for my feet are on the fidgets to be off; andmy friends and neighbours tell me that if my daughter and I make a figure and abrave show at Court, my husband will come to be known far more by me than I byhim, for of course plenty of people will ask, &ldquo;Who are those ladies inthat coach?&rdquo; and some servant of mine will answer, &ldquo;The wife anddaughter of Sancho Panza, governor of the island of Barataria;&rdquo; and inthis way Sancho will become known, and I&rsquo;ll be thought well of, and&ldquo;to Rome for everything.&rdquo; I am as vexed as vexed can be that theyhave gathered no acorns this year in our village; for all that I send yourhighness about half a peck that I went to the wood to gather and pick out oneby one myself, and I could find no bigger ones; I wish they were as big asostrich eggs.<br/>    Let not your high mightiness forget to write to me; and I will take care toanswer, and let you know how I am, and whatever news there may be in thisplace, where I remain, praying our Lord to have your highness in his keepingand not to forget me.<br/>    Sancha my daughter, and my son, kiss your worship&rsquo;s hands.<br/>    She who would rather see your ladyship than write to you,</p><p class="right">Your servant,<br/>TERESA PANZA.</p><p>All were greatly amused by Teresa Panza&rsquo;s letter, but particularlythe duke and duchess; and the duchess asked Don Quixote&rsquo;s opinionwhether they might open the letter that had come for the governor, whichshe suspected must be very good. Don Quixote said that to gratify them hewould open it, and did so, and found that it ran as follows.</p><p class="center">TERESA PANZA&rsquo;S LETTER TO HER HUSBAND SANCHO PANZA.</p><p class="letter">I got thy letter, Sancho of my soul, and I promise thee and swear as a CatholicChristian that I was within two fingers&rsquo; breadth of going mad I was sohappy. I can tell thee, brother, when I came to hear that thou wert a governorI thought I should have dropped dead with pure joy; and thou knowest they saysudden joy kills as well as great sorrow; and as for Sanchica thy daughter, sheleaked from sheer happiness. I had before me the suit thou didst send me, andthe coral beads my lady the duchess sent me round my neck, and the letters inmy hands, and there was the bearer of them standing by, and in spite of allthis I verily believed and thought that what I saw and handled was all a dream;for who could have thought that a goatherd would come to be a governor ofislands? Thou knowest, my friend, what my mother used to say, that one mustlive long to see much; I say it because I expect to see more if I live longer;for I don&rsquo;t expect to stop until I see thee a farmer of taxes or acollector of revenue, which are offices where, though the devil carries offthose who make a bad use of them, still they make and handle money. My lady theduchess will tell thee the desire I have to go to the Court; consider thematter and let me know thy pleasure; I will try to do honour to thee by goingin a coach.<br/>    Neither the curate, nor the barber, nor the bachelor, nor even the sacristan,can believe that thou art a governor, and they say the whole thing is adelusion or an enchantment affair, like everything belonging to thy master DonQuixote; and Samson says he must go in search of thee and drive the governmentout of thy head and the madness out of Don Quixote&rsquo;s skull; I only laugh,and look at my string of beads, and plan out the dress I am going to make forour daughter out of thy suit. I sent some acorns to my lady the duchess; I wishthey had been gold. Send me some strings of pearls if they are in fashion inthat island. Here is the news of the village; La Berrueca has married herdaughter to a good-for-nothing painter, who came here to paint anything thatmight turn up. The council gave him an order to paint his Majesty&rsquo;s armsover the door of the town-hall; he asked two ducats, which they paid him inadvance; he worked for eight days, and at the end of them had nothing painted,and then said he had no turn for painting such trifling things; he returned themoney, and for all that has married on the pretence of being a good workman; tobe sure he has now laid aside his paint-brush and taken a spade in hand, andgoes to the field like a gentleman. Pedro Lobo&rsquo;s son has received thefirst orders and tonsure, with the intention of becoming a priest. Minguilla,Mingo Silvato&rsquo;s granddaughter, found it out, and has gone to law with himon the score of having given her promise of marriage. Evil tongues say she iswith child by him, but he denies it stoutly. There are no olives this year, andthere is not a drop of vinegar to be had in the whole village. A company ofsoldiers passed through here; when they left they took away with them three ofthe girls of the village; I will not tell thee who they are; perhaps they willcome back, and they will be sure to find those who will take them for wiveswith all their blemishes, good or bad. Sanchica is making bonelace; she earnseight maravedis a day clear, which she puts into a moneybox as a help towardshouse furnishing; but now that she is a governor&rsquo;s daughter thou wiltgive her a portion without her working for it. The fountain in the plaza hasrun dry. A flash of lightning struck the gibbet, and I wish they all lit there.I look for an answer to this, and to know thy mind about my going to the Court;and so, God keep thee longer than me, or as long, for I would not leave thee inthis world without me.</p><p class="right">Thy wife,<br/>TERESA PANZA.</p><p>The letters were applauded, laughed over, relished, and admired; and then,as if to put the seal to the business, the courier arrived, bringing theone Sancho sent to Don Quixote, and this, too, was read out, and it raisedsome doubts as to the governor&rsquo;s simplicity. The duchess withdrew tohear from the page about his adventures in Sancho&rsquo;s village, whichhe narrated at full length without leaving a single circumstanceunmentioned. He gave her the acorns, and also a cheese which Teresa hadgiven him as being particularly good and superior to those of Tronchon.The duchess received it with greatest delight, in which we will leave her,to describe the end of the government of the great Sancho Panza, flowerand mirror of all governors of islands.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p52e" id="p52e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p52e.jpg (13K)" src="images/p52e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch53b" id="ch53b"></a>CHAPTER LIII.<br/>OF THE TROUBLOUS END AND TERMINATION SANCHO PANZA&rsquo;S GOVERNMENT CAMETO</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p53a" id="p53a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p53a.jpg (109K)" src="images/p53a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p53a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>To fancy that in this life anything belonging to it will remain for everin the same state is an idle fancy; on the contrary, in it everythingseems to go in a circle, I mean round and round. The spring succeeds thesummer, the summer the fall, the fall the autumn, the autumn the winter,and the winter the spring, and so time rolls with never-ceasing wheel. Man&rsquo;slife alone, swifter than time, speeds onward to its end without any hopeof renewal, save it be in that other life which is endless and boundless.Thus saith Cide Hamete the Mahometan philosopher; for there are many thatby the light of nature alone, without the light of faith, have acomprehension of the fleeting nature and instability of this present lifeand the endless duration of that eternal life we hope for; but our authoris here speaking of the rapidity with which Sancho&rsquo;s government cameto an end, melted away, disappeared, vanished as it were in smoke andshadow. For as he lay in bed on the night of the seventh day of hisgovernment, sated, not with bread and wine, but with delivering judgmentsand giving opinions and making laws and proclamations, just as sleep, inspite of hunger, was beginning to close his eyelids, he heard such a noiseof bell-ringing and shouting that one would have fancied the whole islandwas going to the bottom. He sat up in bed and remained listening intentlyto try if he could make out what could be the cause of so great an uproar;not only, however, was he unable to discover what it was, but as countlessdrums and trumpets now helped to swell the din of the bells and shouts, hewas more puzzled than ever, and filled with fear and terror; and gettingup he put on a pair of slippers because of the dampness of the floor, andwithout throwing a dressing gown or anything of the kind over him herushed out of the door of his room, just in time to see approaching alonga corridor a band of more than twenty persons with lighted torches andnaked swords in their hands, all shouting out, &ldquo;To arms, to arms,señor governor, to arms! The enemy is in the island in countless numbers,and we are lost unless your skill and valour come to our support.&rdquo;</p><p>Keeping up this noise, tumult, and uproar, they came to where Sancho stooddazed and bewildered by what he saw and heard, and as they approached oneof them called out to him, &ldquo;Arm at once, your lordship, if you wouldnot have yourself destroyed and the whole island lost.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What have I to do with arming?&rdquo; said Sancho. &ldquo;What do Iknow about arms or supports? Better leave all that to my master DonQuixote, who will settle it and make all safe in a trice; for I, sinnerthat I am, God help me, don&rsquo;t understand these scuffles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, señor governor,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;what slackness ofmettle this is! Arm yourself; here are arms for you, offensive anddefensive; come out to the plaza and be our leader and captain; it fallsupon you by right, for you are our governor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Arm me then, in God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said Sancho, and they atonce produced two large shields they had come provided with, and placedthem upon him over his shirt, without letting him put on anything else,one shield in front and the other behind, and passing his arms throughopenings they had made, they bound him tight with ropes, so that there hewas walled and boarded up as straight as a spindle and unable to bend hisknees or stir a single step. In his hand they placed a lance, on which heleant to keep himself from falling, and as soon as they had him thus fixedthey bade him march forward and lead them on and give them all courage;for with him for their guide and lamp and morning star, they were sure tobring their business to a successful issue.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p53b" id="p53b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p53b.jpg (332K)" src="images/p53b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p53b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;How am I to march, unlucky being that I am?&rdquo; said Sancho,&ldquo;when I can&rsquo;t stir my knee-caps, for these boards I have boundso tight to my body won&rsquo;t let me. What you must do is carry me inyour arms, and lay me across or set me upright in some postern, and I&rsquo;llhold it either with this lance or with my body.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On, señor governor!&rdquo; cried another, &ldquo;it is fear morethan the boards that keeps you from moving; make haste, stir yourself, forthere is no time to lose; the enemy is increasing in numbers, the shoutsgrow louder, and the danger is pressing.&rdquo;</p><p>Urged by these exhortations and reproaches the poor governor made anattempt to advance, but fell to the ground with such a crash that hefancied he had broken himself all to pieces. There he lay like a tortoiseenclosed in its shell, or a side of bacon between two kneading-troughs, ora boat bottom up on the beach; nor did the gang of jokers feel anycompassion for him when they saw him down; so far from that, extinguishingtheir torches they began to shout afresh and to renew the calls to armswith such energy, trampling on poor Sancho, and slashing at him over theshield with their swords in such a way that, if he had not gatheredhimself together and made himself small and drawn in his head between theshields, it would have fared badly with the poor governor, as, squeezedinto that narrow compass, he lay, sweating and sweating again, andcommending himself with all his heart to God to deliver him from hispresent peril. Some stumbled over him, others fell upon him, and one therewas who took up a position on top of him for some time, and from thence asif from a watchtower issued orders to the troops, shouting out, &ldquo;Here,our side! Here the enemy is thickest! Hold the breach there! Shut thatgate! Barricade those ladders! Here with your stink-pots of pitch andresin, and kettles of boiling oil! Block the streets with feather beds!&rdquo;In short, in his ardour he mentioned every little thing, and everyimplement and engine of war by means of which an assault upon a city iswarded off, while the bruised and battered Sancho, who heard and sufferedall, was saying to himself, &ldquo;O if it would only please the Lord tolet the island be lost at once, and I could see myself either dead or outof this torture!&rdquo; Heaven heard his prayer, and when he leastexpected it he heard voices exclaiming, &ldquo;Victory, victory! The enemyretreats beaten! Come, señor governor, get up, and come and enjoy thevictory, and divide the spoils that have been won from the foe by themight of that invincible arm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Lift me up,&rdquo; said the wretched Sancho in a woebegone voice.They helped him to rise, and as soon as he was on his feet said, &ldquo;Theenemy I have beaten you may nail to my forehead; I don&rsquo;t want todivide the spoils of the foe, I only beg and entreat some friend, if Ihave one, to give me a sup of wine, for I&rsquo;m parched with thirst, andwipe me dry, for I&rsquo;m turning to water.&rdquo;</p><p>They rubbed him down, fetched him wine and unbound the shields, and heseated himself upon his bed, and with fear, agitation, and fatigue hefainted away. Those who had been concerned in the joke were now sorry theyhad pushed it so far; however, the anxiety his fainting away had causedthem was relieved by his returning to himself. He asked what o&rsquo;clockit was; they told him it was just daybreak. He said no more, and insilence began to dress himself, while all watched him, waiting to see whatthe haste with which he was putting on his clothes meant.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p53c" id="p53c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p53c.jpg (389K)" src="images/p53c.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p53c.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>He got himself dressed at last, and then, slowly, for he was sorelybruised and could not go fast, he proceeded to the stable, followed by allwho were present, and going up to Dapple embraced him and gave him aloving kiss on the forehead, and said to him, not without tears in hiseyes, &ldquo;Come along, comrade and friend and partner of my toils andsorrows; when I was with you and had no cares to trouble me except mendingyour harness and feeding your little carcass, happy were my hours, mydays, and my years; but since I left you, and mounted the towers ofambition and pride, a thousand miseries, a thousand troubles, and fourthousand anxieties have entered into my soul;&rdquo; and all the while hewas speaking in this strain he was fixing the pack-saddle on the ass,without a word from anyone. Then having Dapple saddled, he, with greatpain and difficulty, got up on him, and addressing himself to themajordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, and Pedro Recio the doctor andseveral others who stood by, he said, &ldquo;Make way, gentlemen, and letme go back to my old freedom; let me go look for my past life, and raisemyself up from this present death. I was not born to be a governor orprotect islands or cities from the enemies that choose to attack them.Ploughing and digging, vinedressing and pruning, are more in my way thandefending provinces or kingdoms. Saint Peter is very well at Rome;I mean each of us is best following the trade he was born to. Areaping-hook fits my hand better than a governor&rsquo;s sceptre; I&rsquo;drather have my fill of gazpacho than be subject to the misery of ameddling doctor who kills me with hunger, and I&rsquo;d rather lie insummer under the shade of an oak, and in winter wrap myself in a doublesheepskin jacket in freedom, than go to bed between holland sheets anddress in sables under the restraint of a government. God be with yourworships, and tell my lord the duke that &lsquo;naked I was born, naked Ifind myself, I neither lose nor gain;&rsquo; I mean that without afarthing I came into this government, and without a farthing I go out ofit, very different from the way governors commonly leave other islands.Stand aside and let me go; I have to plaster myself, for I believe everyone of my ribs is crushed, thanks to the enemies that have been tramplingover me to-night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is unnecessary, señor governor,&rdquo; said Doctor Recio,&ldquo;for I will give your worship a draught against falls and bruisesthat will soon make you as sound and strong as ever; and as for your dietI promise your worship to behave better, and let you eat plentifully ofwhatever you like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You spoke late,&rdquo; said Sancho. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d as soon turnTurk as stay any longer. Those jokes won&rsquo;t pass a second time. ByGod I&rsquo;d as soon remain in this government, or take another, even ifit was offered me between two plates, as fly to heaven without wings. I amof the breed of the Panzas, and they are every one of them obstinate, andif they once say &lsquo;odds,&rsquo; odds it must be, no matter if it isevens, in spite of all the world. Here in this stable I leave the ant&rsquo;swings that lifted me up into the air for the swifts and other birds to eatme, and let&rsquo;s take to level ground and our feet once more; and ifthey&rsquo;re not shod in pinked shoes of cordovan, they won&rsquo;t wantfor rough sandals of hemp; &lsquo;every ewe to her like,&rsquo; &lsquo;andlet no one stretch his leg beyond the length of the sheet;&rsquo; and nowlet me pass, for it&rsquo;s growing late with me.&rdquo;</p><p>To this the majordomo said, &ldquo;Señor governor, we would let yourworship go with all our hearts, though it sorely grieves us to lose you,for your wit and Christian conduct naturally make us regret you; but it iswell known that every governor, before he leaves the place where he hasbeen governing, is bound first of all to render an account. Let yourworship do so for the ten days you have held the government, and then youmay go and the peace of God go with you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No one can demand it of me,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but he whommy lord the duke shall appoint; I am going to meet him, and to him I willrender an exact one; besides, when I go forth naked as I do, there is noother proof needed to show that I have governed like an angel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God the great Sancho is right,&rdquo; said Doctor Recio, &ldquo;andwe should let him go, for the duke will be beyond measure glad to see him.&rdquo;</p><p>They all agreed to this, and allowed him to go, first offering to bear himcompany and furnish him with all he wanted for his own comfort or for thejourney. Sancho said he did not want anything more than a little barleyfor Dapple, and half a cheese and half a loaf for himself; for thedistance being so short there was no occasion for any better or bulkierprovant. They all embraced him, and he with tears embraced all of them,and left them filled with admiration not only at his remarks but at hisfirm and sensible resolution.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p53e" id="p53e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p53e.jpg (56K)" src="images/p53e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch54b" id="ch54b"></a>CHAPTER LIV.<br/>WHICH DEALS WITH MATTERS RELATING TO THIS HISTORY AND NO OTHER</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p54a" id="p54a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p54a.jpg (109K)" src="images/p54a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p54a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The duke and duchess resolved that the challenge Don Quixote had, for thereason already mentioned, given their vassal, should be proceeded with;and as the young man was in Flanders, whither he had fled to escape havingDoña Rodriguez for a mother-in-law, they arranged to substitute for him aGascon lacquey, named Tosilos, first of all carefully instructing him inall he had to do. Two days later the duke told Don Quixote that in fourdays from that time his opponent would present himself on the field ofbattle armed as a knight, and would maintain that the damsel lied by halfa beard, nay a whole beard, if she affirmed that he had given her apromise of marriage. Don Quixote was greatly pleased at the news, andpromised himself to do wonders in the lists, and reckoned it rare goodfortune that an opportunity should have offered for letting his noblehosts see what the might of his strong arm was capable of; and so in highspirits and satisfaction he awaited the expiration of the four days, whichmeasured by his impatience seemed spinning themselves out into fourhundred ages. Let us leave them to pass as we do other things, and go andbear Sancho company, as mounted on Dapple, half glad, half sad, he pacedalong on his road to join his master, in whose society he was happier thanin being governor of all the islands in the world. Well then, it sohappened that before he had gone a great way from the island of hisgovernment (and whether it was island, city, town, or village that hegoverned he never troubled himself to inquire) he saw coming along theroad he was travelling six pilgrims with staves, foreigners of that sortthat beg for alms singing; who as they drew near arranged themselves in aline and lifting up their voices all together began to sing in their ownlanguage something that Sancho could not understand, with the exception of one wordwhich sounded plainly &ldquo;alms,&rdquo; from which he gathered that itwas alms they asked for in their song; and being, as Cide Hamete says,remarkably charitable, he took out of his alforjas the half loaf and halfcheese he had been provided with, and gave them to them, explaining tothem by signs that he had nothing else to give them. They received themvery gladly, but exclaimed, &ldquo;Geld! Geld!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you want of me, good people,&rdquo;said Sancho.</p><p>On this one of them took a purse out of his bosom and showed it to Sancho,by which he comprehended they were asking for money, and putting his thumbto his throat and spreading his hand upwards he gave them to understandthat he had not the sign of a coin about him, and urging Dapple forward hebroke through them. But as he was passing, one of them who had beenexamining him very closely rushed towards him, and flinging his arms roundhim exclaimed in a loud voice and good Spanish, &ldquo;God bless me! What&rsquo;sthis I see? Is it possible that I hold in my arms my dear friend, my goodneighbour Sancho Panza? But there&rsquo;s no doubt about it, for I&rsquo;mnot asleep, nor am I drunk just now.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho was surprised to hear himself called by his name and find himselfembraced by a foreign pilgrim, and after regarding him steadily withoutspeaking he was still unable to recognise him; but the pilgrim perceivinghis perplexity cried, &ldquo;What! and is it possible, Sancho Panza, thatthou dost not know thy neighbour Ricote, the Morisco shopkeeper of thyvillage?&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho upon this looking at him more carefully began to recall hisfeatures, and at last recognised him perfectly, and without getting offthe ass threw his arms round his neck saying, &ldquo;Who the devil couldhave known thee, Ricote, in this mummer&rsquo;s dress thou art in? Tellme, who has frenchified thee, and how dost thou dare to return to Spain,where if they catch thee and recognise thee it will go hard enough withthee?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If thou dost not betray me, Sancho,&rdquo; said the pilgrim,&ldquo;I am safe; for in this dress no one will recognise me; but let usturn aside out of the road into that grove there where my comrades aregoing to eat and rest, and thou shalt eat with them there, for they arevery good fellows; I&rsquo;ll have time enough to tell thee then all thathas happened me since I left our village in obedience to his Majesty&rsquo;sedict that threatened such severities against the unfortunate people of mynation, as thou hast heard.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho complied, and Ricote having spoken to the other pilgrims theywithdrew to the grove they saw, turning a considerable distance out of theroad. They threw down their staves, took off their pilgrim&rsquo;s cloaksand remained in their under-clothing; they were all good-looking youngfellows, except Ricote, who was a man somewhat advanced in years. Theycarried alforjas all of them, and all apparently well filled, at leastwith things provocative of thirst, such as would summon it from twoleagues off. They stretched themselves on the ground, and making atablecloth of the grass they spread upon it bread, salt, knives, walnut,scraps of cheese, and well-picked ham-bones which if they were pastgnawing were not past sucking. They also put down a black dainty called,they say, caviar, and made of the eggs of fish, a great thirst-wakener.Nor was there any lack of olives, dry, it is true, and without anyseasoning, but for all that toothsome and pleasant. But what made the bestshow in the field of the banquet was half a dozen botas of wine, for eachof them produced his own from his alforjas; even the good Ricote, who froma Morisco had transformed himself into a German or Dutchman, took out his,which in size might have vied with the five others. They then began to eatwith very great relish and very leisurely, making the most of each morsel&mdash;verysmall ones of everything&mdash;they took up on the point of the knife; andthen all at the same moment raised their arms and botas aloft, the mouthsplaced in their mouths, and all eyes fixed on heaven just as if they weretaking aim at it; and in this attitude they remained ever so long, waggingtheir heads from side to side as if in acknowledgment of the pleasure theywere enjoying while they decanted the bowels of the bottles into their ownstomachs.</p><p>Sancho beheld all, &ldquo;and nothing gave him pain;&rdquo; so far fromthat, acting on the proverb he knew so well, &ldquo;when thou art at Romedo as thou seest,&rdquo; he asked Ricote for his bota and took aim likethe rest of them, and with not less enjoyment. Four times did the botasbear being uplifted, but the fifth it was all in vain, for they were drierand more sapless than a rush by that time, which made the jollity that hadbeen kept up so far begin to flag.</p><p>Every now and then someone of them would grasp Sancho&rsquo;s right handin his own saying, &ldquo;Español y Tudesqui tuto uno: bon compaño;&rdquo;and Sancho would answer, &ldquo;Bon compaño, jur a Di!&rdquo; and then gooff into a fit of laughter that lasted an hour, without a thought for themoment of anything that had befallen him in his government; for cares havevery little sway over us while we are eating and drinking. At length, thewine having come to an end with them, drowsiness began to come over them,and they dropped asleep on their very table and tablecloth. Ricote andSancho alone remained awake, for they had eaten more and drunk less, andRicote drawing Sancho aside, they seated themselves at the foot of abeech, leaving the pilgrims buried in sweet sleep; and without oncefalling into his own Morisco tongue Ricote spoke as follows in pureCastilian:</p><p>&ldquo;Thou knowest well, neighbour and friend Sancho Panza, how theproclamation or edict his Majesty commanded to be issued against those ofmy nation filled us all with terror and dismay; me at least it did,insomuch that I think before the time granted us for quitting Spain wasout, the full force of the penalty had already fallen upon me and upon mychildren. I decided, then, and I think wisely (just like one who knowsthat at a certain date the house he lives in will be taken from him, andlooks out beforehand for another to change into), I decided, I say, toleave the town myself, alone and without my family, and go to seek outsome place to remove them to comfortably and not in the hurried way inwhich the others took their departure; for I saw very plainly, and so didall the older men among us, that the proclamations were not mere threats,as some said, but positive enactments which would be enforced at theappointed time; and what made me believe this was what I knew of the baseand extravagant designs which our people harboured, designs of such anature that I think it was a divine inspiration that moved his Majesty tocarry out a resolution so spirited; not that we were all guilty, for somethere were true and steadfast Christians; but they were so few that theycould make no head against those who were not; and it was not prudent tocherish a viper in the bosom by having enemies in the house. In short itwas with just cause that we were visited with the penalty of banishment, amild and lenient one in the eyes of some, but to us the most terrible thatcould be inflicted upon us. Wherever we are we weep for Spain; for afterall we were born there and it is our natural fatherland. Nowhere do wefind the reception our unhappy condition needs; and in Barbary and all theparts of Africa where we counted upon being received, succoured, andwelcomed, it is there they insult and ill-treat us most. We knew not ourgood fortune until we lost it; and such is the longing we almost all of ushave to return to Spain, that most of those who like myself know thelanguage, and there are many who do, come back to it and leave their wivesand children forsaken yonder, so great is their love for it; and now Iknow by experience the meaning of the saying, sweet is the love of one&rsquo;scountry.</p><p>&ldquo;I left our village, as I said, and went to France, but though theygave us a kind reception there I was anxious to see all I could. I crossedinto Italy, and reached Germany, and there it seemed to me we might livewith more freedom, as the inhabitants do not pay any attention to triflingpoints; everyone lives as he likes, for in most parts they enjoy libertyof conscience. I took a house in a town near Augsburg, and then joinedthese pilgrims, who are in the habit of coming to Spain in great numbersevery year to visit the shrines there, which they look upon as theirIndies and a sure and certain source of gain. They travel nearly all overit, and there is no town out of which they do not go full up of meat anddrink, as the saying is, and with a real, at least, in money, and theycome off at the end of their travels with more than a hundred crownssaved, which, changed into gold, they smuggle out of the kingdom either inthe hollow of their staves or in the patches of their pilgrim&rsquo;scloaks or by some device of their own, and carry to their own country inspite of the guards at the posts and passes where they are searched. Nowmy purpose is, Sancho, to carry away the treasure that I left buried,which, as it is outside the town, I shall be able to do without risk, andto write, or cross over from Valencia, to my daughter and wife, who I knoware at Algiers, and find some means of bringing them to some French portand thence to Germany, there to await what it may be God&rsquo;s will todo with us; for, after all, Sancho, I know well that Ricota my daughterand Francisca Ricota my wife are Catholic Christians, and though I am notso much so, still I am more of a Christian than a Moor, and it is alwaysmy prayer to God that he will open the eyes of my understanding and showme how I am to serve him; but what amazes me and I cannot understand iswhy my wife and daughter should have gone to Barbary rather than toFrance, where they could live as Christians.&rdquo;</p><p>To this Sancho replied, &ldquo;Remember, Ricote, that may not have beenopen to them, for Juan Tiopieyo thy wife&rsquo;s brother took them, andbeing a true Moor he went where he could go most easily; and another thingI can tell thee, it is my belief thou art going in vain to look for whatthou hast left buried, for we heard they took from thy brother-in-law andthy wife a great quantity of pearls and money in gold which they broughtto be passed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said Ricote; &ldquo;but I know they did nottouch my hoard, for I did not tell them where it was, for fear ofaccidents; and so, if thou wilt come with me, Sancho, and help me to takeit away and conceal it, I will give thee two hundred crowns wherewith thoumayest relieve thy necessities, and, as thou knowest, I know they aremany.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would do it,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;but I am not at allcovetous, for I gave up an office this morning in which, if I was, I mighthave made the walls of my house of gold and dined off silver plates beforesix months were over; and so for this reason, and because I feel I wouldbe guilty of treason to my king if I helped his enemies, I would not gowith thee if instead of promising me two hundred crowns thou wert to giveme four hundred here in hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what office is this thou hast given up, Sancho?&rdquo; askedRicote.</p><p>&ldquo;I have given up being governor of an island,&rdquo; said Sancho,&ldquo;and such a one, faith, as you won&rsquo;t find the like of easily.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And where is this island?&rdquo; said Ricote.</p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;two leagues from here, and it iscalled the island of Barataria.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Sancho,&rdquo; said Ricote; &ldquo;islands are away outin the sea; there are no islands on the mainland.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? No islands!&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I tell thee, friendRicote, I left it this morning, and yesterday I was governing there as Ipleased like a sagittarius; but for all that I gave it up, for it seemedto me a dangerous office, a governor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what hast thou gained by the government?&rdquo; asked Ricote.</p><p>&ldquo;I have gained,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;the knowledge that I amno good for governing, unless it is a drove of cattle, and that the richesthat are to be got by these governments are got at the cost of one&rsquo;srest and sleep, ay and even one&rsquo;s food; for in islands the governorsmust eat little, especially if they have doctors to look after theirhealth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand thee, Sancho,&rdquo; said Ricote; &ldquo;butit seems to me all nonsense thou art talking. Who would give thee islandsto govern? Is there any scarcity in the world of cleverer men than thouart for governors? Hold thy peace, Sancho, and come back to thy senses,and consider whether thou wilt come with me as I said to help me to takeaway treasure I left buried (for indeed it may be called a treasure, it isso large), and I will give thee wherewithal to keep thee, as I told thee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I have told thee already, Ricote, that I will not,&rdquo; saidSancho; &ldquo;let it content thee that by me thou shalt not be betrayed,and go thy way in God&rsquo;s name and let me go mine; for I know thatwell-gotten gain may be lost, but ill-gotten gain is lost, itself and itsowner likewise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will not press thee, Sancho,&rdquo; said Ricote; &ldquo;but tellme, wert thou in our village when my wife and daughter and brother-in-lawleft it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was so,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;and I can tell thee thydaughter left it looking so lovely that all the village turned out to seeher, and everybody said she was the fairest creature in the world. Shewept as she went, and embraced all her friends and acquaintances and thosewho came out to see her, and she begged them all to commend her to God andOur Lady his mother, and this in such a touching way that it made me weepmyself, though I&rsquo;m not much given to tears commonly; and, faith,many a one would have liked to hide her, or go out and carry her off onthe road; but the fear of going against the king&rsquo;s command kept themback. The one who showed himself most moved was Don Pedro Gregorio, therich young heir thou knowest of, and they say he was deep in love withher; and since she left he has not been seen in our village again, and weall suspect he has gone after her to steal her away, but so far nothinghas been heard of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I always had a suspicion that gentleman had a passion for mydaughter,&rdquo; said Ricote; &ldquo;but as I felt sure of my Ricota&rsquo;svirtue it gave me no uneasiness to know that he loved her; for thou musthave heard it said, Sancho, that the Morisco women seldom or never engagein amours with the old Christians; and my daughter, who I fancy thoughtmore of being a Christian than of lovemaking, would not trouble herselfabout the attentions of this heir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God grant it,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for it would be a badbusiness for both of them; but now let me be off, friend Ricote, for Iwant to reach where my master Don Quixote is to-night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God be with thee, brother Sancho,&rdquo; said Ricote; &ldquo;mycomrades are beginning to stir, and it is time, too, for us to continueour journey;&rdquo; and then they both embraced, and Sancho mountedDapple, and Ricote leant upon his staff, and so they parted.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p54e" id="p54e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p54e.jpg (40K)" src="images/p54e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch55b" id="ch55b"></a>CHAPTER LV.<br/>OF WHAT BEFELL SANCHO ON THE ROAD, AND OTHER THINGS THAT CANNOT BESURPASSED</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p55a" id="p55a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p55a.jpg (126K)" src="images/p55a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p55a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The length of time he delayed with Ricote prevented Sancho from reaching theduke&rsquo;s castle that day, though he was within half a league of it whennight, somewhat dark and cloudy, overtook him. This, however, as it was summertime, did not give him much uneasiness, and he turned aside out of the roadintending to wait for morning; but his ill luck and hard fate so willed it thatas he was searching about for a place to make himself as comfortable aspossible, he and Dapple fell into a deep dark hole that lay among some very oldbuildings. As he fell he commended himself with all his heart to God, fancyinghe was not going to stop until he reached the depths of the bottomless pit; butit did not turn out so, for at little more than thrice a man&rsquo;s heightDapple touched bottom, and he found himself sitting on him without havingreceived any hurt or damage whatever. He felt himself all over and held hisbreath to try whether he was quite sound or had a hole made in him anywhere,and finding himself all right and whole and in perfect health he was profuse inhis thanks to God our Lord for the mercy that had been shown him, for he madesure he had been broken into a thousand pieces. He also felt along the sides ofthe pit with his hands to see if it were possible to get out of it withouthelp, but he found they were quite smooth and afforded no hold anywhere, atwhich he was greatly distressed, especially when he heard how pathetically anddolefully Dapple was bemoaning himself, and no wonder he complained, nor was itfrom ill-temper, for in truth he was not in a very good case.&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;what unexpected accidents happen atevery step to those who live in this miserable world! Who would have said thatone who saw himself yesterday sitting on a throne, governor of an island,giving orders to his servants and his vassals, would see himself to-day buriedin a pit without a soul to help him, or servant or vassal to come to hisrelief? Here must we perish with hunger, my ass and myself, if indeed wedon&rsquo;t die first, he of his bruises and injuries, and I of grief andsorrow. At any rate I&rsquo;ll not be as lucky as my master Don Quixote of LaMancha, when he went down into the cave of that enchanted Montesinos, where hefound people to make more of him than if he had been in his own house; for itseems he came in for a table laid out and a bed ready made. There he saw fairand pleasant visions, but here I&rsquo;ll see, I imagine, toads and adders.Unlucky wretch that I am, what an end my follies and fancies have come to!They&rsquo;ll take up my bones out of this, when it is heaven&rsquo;s will thatI&rsquo;m found, picked clean, white and polished, and my good Dapple&rsquo;swith them, and by that, perhaps, it will be found out who we are, at least bysuch as have heard that Sancho Panza never separated from his ass, nor his assfrom Sancho Panza. Unlucky wretches, I say again, that our hard fate should notlet us die in our own country and among our own people, where if there was nohelp for our misfortune, at any rate there would be someone to grieve for itand to close our eyes as we passed away! O comrade and friend, how ill have Irepaid thy faithful services! Forgive me, and entreat Fortune, as well as thoucanst, to deliver us out of this miserable strait we are both in; and I promiseto put a crown of laurel on thy head, and make thee look like a poet laureate,and give thee double feeds.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p55b" id="p55b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p55b.jpg (273K)" src="images/p55b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p55b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>In this strain did Sancho bewail himself, and his ass listened to him, butanswered him never a word, such was the distress and anguish the poorbeast found himself in. At length, after a night spent in bitter moaningsand lamentations, day came, and by its light Sancho perceived that it waswholly impossible to escape out of that pit without help, and he fell tobemoaning his fate and uttering loud shouts to find out if there wasanyone within hearing; but all his shouting was only crying in thewilderness, for there was not a soul anywhere in the neighbourhood to hearhim, and then at last he gave himself up for dead. Dapple was lying on hisback, and Sancho helped him to his feet, which he was scarcely able tokeep; and then taking a piece of bread out of his alforjas which hadshared their fortunes in the fall, he gave it to the ass, to whom it wasnot unwelcome, saying to him as if he understood him, &ldquo;With breadall sorrows are less.&rdquo;</p><p>And now he perceived on one side of the pit a hole large enough to admit aperson if he stooped and squeezed himself into a small compass. Sanchomade for it, and entered it by creeping, and found it wide and spacious onthe inside, which he was able to see as a ray of sunlight that penetratedwhat might be called the roof showed it all plainly. He observed too thatit opened and widened out into another spacious cavity; seeing which hemade his way back to where the ass was, and with a stone began to pickaway the clay from the hole until in a short time he had made room for thebeast to pass easily, and this accomplished, taking him by the halter, heproceeded to traverse the cavern to see if there was any outlet at theother end. He advanced, sometimes in the dark, sometimes without light,but never without fear; &ldquo;God Almighty help me!&rdquo; said he tohimself; &ldquo;this that is a misadventure to me would make a goodadventure for my master Don Quixote. He would have been sure to take thesedepths and dungeons for flowery gardens or the palaces of Galiana, andwould have counted upon issuing out of this darkness and imprisonment intosome blooming meadow; but I, unlucky that I am, hopeless and spiritless,expect at every step another pit deeper than the first to open under myfeet and swallow me up for good; &lsquo;welcome evil, if thou comestalone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>In this way and with these reflections he seemed to himself to havetravelled rather more than half a league, when at last he perceived a dimlight that looked like daylight and found its way in on one side, showingthat this road, which appeared to him the road to the other world, led tosome opening.</p><p>Here Cide Hamete leaves him, and returns to Don Quixote, who in highspirits and satisfaction was looking forward to the day fixed for thebattle he was to fight with him who had robbed Doña Rodriguez&rsquo;sdaughter of her honour, for whom he hoped to obtain satisfaction for thewrong and injury shamefully done to her. It came to pass, then, thathaving sallied forth one morning to practise and exercise himself in whathe would have to do in the encounter he expected to find himself engagedin the next day, as he was putting Rocinante through his paces or pressinghim to the charge, he brought his feet so close to a pit that but forreining him in tightly it would have been impossible for him to avoidfalling into it. He pulled him up, however, without a fall, and coming alittle closer examined the hole without dismounting; but as he was lookingat it he heard loud cries proceeding from it, and by listening attentivelywas able to make out that he who uttered them was saying, &ldquo;Ho, abovethere! is there any Christian that hears me, or any charitable gentlemanthat will take pity on a sinner buried alive, on an unfortunatedisgoverned governor?&rdquo;</p><p>It struck Don Quixote that it was the voice of Sancho Panza he heard,whereat he was taken aback and amazed, and raising his own voice as muchas he could, he cried out, &ldquo;Who is below there? Who is thatcomplaining?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who should be here, or who should complain,&rdquo; was the answer,&ldquo;but the forlorn Sancho Panza, for his sins and for his ill-luckgovernor of the island of Barataria, squire that was to the famous knightDon Quixote of La Mancha?&rdquo;</p><p>When Don Quixote heard this his amazement was redoubled and hisperturbation grew greater than ever, for it suggested itself to his mindthat Sancho must be dead, and that his soul was in torment down there; andcarried away by this idea he exclaimed, &ldquo;I conjure thee byeverything that as a Catholic Christian I can conjure thee by, tell me whothou art; and if thou art a soul in torment, tell me what thou wouldsthave me do for thee; for as my profession is to give aid and succour tothose that need it in this world, it will also extend to aiding andsuccouring the distressed of the other, who cannot help themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; answered the voice, &ldquo;your worship whospeaks to me must be my master Don Quixote of La Mancha; nay, from thetone of the voice it is plain it can be nobody else.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don Quixote I am,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;he whoseprofession it is to aid and succour the living and the dead in theirnecessities; wherefore tell me who thou art, for thou art keeping me insuspense; because, if thou art my squire Sancho Panza, and art dead, sincethe devils have not carried thee off, and thou art by God&rsquo;s mercy inpurgatory, our holy mother the Roman Catholic Church has intercessorymeans sufficient to release thee from the pains thou art in; and I for mypart will plead with her to that end, so far as my substance will go;without further delay, therefore, declare thyself, and tell me who thouart.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By all that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;and by thebirth of whomsoever your worship chooses, I swear, Señor Don Quixote of LaMancha, that I am your squire Sancho Panza, and that I have never died allmy life; but that, having given up my government for reasons that wouldrequire more time to explain, I fell last night into this pit where I amnow, and Dapple is witness and won&rsquo;t let me lie, for more by tokenhe is here with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Nor was this all; one would have fancied the ass understood what Sanchosaid, because that moment he began to bray so loudly that the whole caverang again.</p><p>&ldquo;Famous testimony!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Quixote; &ldquo;I know thatbray as well as if I was its mother, and thy voice too, my Sancho. Waitwhile I go to the duke&rsquo;s castle, which is close by, and I will bringsomeone to take thee out of this pit into which thy sins no doubt havebrought thee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go, your worship,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and come back quickfor God&rsquo;s sake; for I cannot bear being buried alive any longer, andI&rsquo;m dying of fear.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote left him, and hastened to the castle to tell the duke andduchess what had happened Sancho, and they were not a little astonished atit; they could easily understand his having fallen, from the confirmatorycircumstance of the cave which had been in existence there from timeimmemorial; but they could not imagine how he had quitted the governmentwithout their receiving any intimation of his coming. To be brief, theyfetched ropes and tackle, as the saying is, and by dint of many hands andmuch labour they drew up Dapple and Sancho Panza out of the darkness intothe light of day. A student who saw him remarked, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s theway all bad governors should come out of their governments, as this sinnercomes out of the depths of the pit, dead with hunger, pale, and I supposewithout a farthing.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho overheard him and said, &ldquo;It is eight or ten days, brothergrowler, since I entered upon the government of the island they gave me,and all that time I never had a bellyful of victuals, no not for an hour;doctors persecuted me and enemies crushed my bones; nor had I anyopportunity of taking bribes or levying taxes; and if that be the case, asit is, I don&rsquo;t deserve, I think, to come out in this fashion; but&lsquo;man proposes and God disposes;&rsquo; and God knows what is best,and what suits each one best; and &lsquo;as the occasion, so thebehaviour;&rsquo; and &lsquo;let nobody say &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t drink ofthis water;&rdquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;where one thinks there are flitches,there are no pegs;&rsquo; God knows my meaning and that&rsquo;s enough; Isay no more, though I could.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be not angry or annoyed at what thou hearest, Sancho,&rdquo; saidDon Quixote, &ldquo;or there will never be an end of it; keep a safeconscience and let them say what they like; for trying to stop slanderers&rsquo;tongues is like trying to put gates to the open plain. If a governor comesout of his government rich, they say he has been a thief; and if he comesout poor, that he has been a noodle and a blockhead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be pretty sure this time,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;toset me down for a fool rather than a thief.&rdquo;</p><p>Thus talking, and surrounded by boys and a crowd of people, they reachedthe castle, where in one of the corridors the duke and duchess stoodwaiting for them; but Sancho would not go up to see the duke until he hadfirst put up Dapple in the stable, for he said he had passed a very badnight in his last quarters; then he went upstairs to see his lord andlady, and kneeling before them he said, &ldquo;Because it was yourhighnesses&rsquo; pleasure, not because of any desert of my own, I went togovern your island of Barataria, which &lsquo;I entered naked, and naked Ifind myself; I neither lose nor gain.&rsquo; Whether I have governed wellor ill, I have had witnesses who will say what they think fit. I haveanswered questions, I have decided causes, and always dying of hunger, forDoctor Pedro Recio of Tirteafuera, the island and governor doctor, wouldhave it so. Enemies attacked us by night and put us in a great quandary,but the people of the island say they came off safe and victorious by themight of my arm; and may God give them as much health as there&rsquo;struth in what they say. In short, during that time I have weighed thecares and responsibilities governing brings with it, and by my reckoning Ifind my shoulders can&rsquo;t bear them, nor are they a load for my loinsor arrows for my quiver; and so, before the government threw me over Ipreferred to throw the government over; and yesterday morning I left theisland as I found it, with the same streets, houses, and roofs it had whenI entered it. I asked no loan of anybody, nor did I try to fill my pocket;and though I meant to make some useful laws, I made hardly any, as I wasafraid they would not be kept; for in that case it comes to the same thingto make them or not to make them. I quitted the island, as I said, withoutany escort except my ass; I fell into a pit, I pushed on through it, untilthis morning by the light of the sun I saw an outlet, but not so easy aone but that, had not heaven sent me my master Don Quixote, I&rsquo;d havestayed there till the end of the world. So now my lord and lady duke andduchess, here is your governor Sancho Panza, who in the bare ten days hehas held the government has come by the knowledge that he would not giveanything to be governor, not to say of an island, but of the whole world;and that point being settled, kissing your worships&rsquo; feet, andimitating the game of the boys when they say, &lsquo;leap thou, and giveme one,&rsquo; I take a leap out of the government and pass into theservice of my master Don Quixote; for after all, though in it I eat mybread in fear and trembling, at any rate I take my fill; and for my part,so long as I&rsquo;m full, it&rsquo;s all alike to me whether it&rsquo;swith carrots or with partridges.&rdquo;</p><p>Here Sancho brought his long speech to an end, Don Quixote having been thewhole time in dread of his uttering a host of absurdities; and when hefound him leave off with so few, he thanked heaven in his heart. The dukeembraced Sancho and told him he was heartily sorry he had given up thegovernment so soon, but that he would see that he was provided with someother post on his estate less onerous and more profitable. The duchessalso embraced him, and gave orders that he should be taken good care of,as it was plain to see he had been badly treated and worse bruised.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p55e" id="p55e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p55e.jpg (18K)" src="images/p55e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch56b" id="ch56b"></a>CHAPTER LVI.br/>OF THE PRODIGIOUS AND UNPARALLELED BATTLE THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DONQUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA AND THE LACQUEY TOSILOS IN DEFENCE OF THE DAUGHTER OFDOÑA RODRIGUEZ</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p56a" id="p56a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p56a.jpg (158K)" src="images/p56a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p56a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The duke and duchess had no reason to regret the joke that had been playedupon Sancho Panza in giving him the government; especially as theirmajordomo returned the same day, and gave them a minute account of almostevery word and deed that Sancho uttered or did during the time; and towind up with, eloquently described to them the attack upon the island andSancho&rsquo;s fright and departure, with which they were not a littleamused. After this the history goes on to say that the day fixed for thebattle arrived, and that the duke, after having repeatedly instructed hislacquey Tosilos how to deal with Don Quixote so as to vanquish him withoutkilling or wounding him, gave orders to have the heads removed from thelances, telling Don Quixote that Christian charity, on which he plumedhimself, could not suffer the battle to be fought with so much risk anddanger to life; and that he must be content with the offer of abattlefield on his territory (though that was against the decree of theholy Council, which prohibits all challenges of the sort) and not pushsuch an arduous venture to its extreme limits. Don Quixote bade hisexcellence arrange all matters connected with the affair as he pleased, ason his part he would obey him in everything. The dread day, then, havingarrived, and the duke having ordered a spacious stand to be erected facingthe court of the castle for the judges of the field and the appellantduennas, mother and daughter, vast crowds flocked from all the villagesand hamlets of the neighbourhood to see the novel spectacle of the battle;nobody, dead or alive, in those parts having ever seen or heard of such aone.</p><p>The first person to enter the field and the lists was the master of theceremonies, who surveyed and paced the whole ground to see that there wasnothing unfair and nothing concealed to make the combatants stumble orfall; then the duennas entered and seated themselves, enveloped in mantlescovering their eyes, nay even their bosoms, and displaying no slightemotion as Don Quixote appeared in the lists. Shortly afterwards,accompanied by several trumpets and mounted on a powerful steed thatthreatened to crush the whole place, the great lacquey Tosilos made hisappearance on one side of the courtyard with his visor down and stifflycased in a suit of stout shining armour. The horse was a manifestFrieslander, broad-backed and flea-bitten, and with half a hundred of woolhanging to each of his fetlocks. The gallant combatant came well primed byhis master the duke as to how he was to bear himself against the valiantDon Quixote of La Mancha; being warned that he must on no account slayhim, but strive to shirk the first encounter so as to avoid the risk ofkilling him, as he was sure to do if he met him full tilt. He crossed thecourtyard at a walk, and coming to where the duennas were placed stoppedto look at her who demanded him for a husband; the marshal of the fieldsummoned Don Quixote, who had already presented himself in the courtyard,and standing by the side of Tosilos he addressed the duennas, and askedthem if they consented that Don Quixote of La Mancha should do battle fortheir right. They said they did, and that whatever he should do in thatbehalf they declared rightly done, final and valid. By this time the dukeand duchess had taken their places in a gallery commanding the enclosure,which was filled to overflowing with a multitude of people eager to seethis perilous and unparalleled encounter. The conditions of the combatwere that if Don Quixote proved the victor his antagonist was to marry thedaughter of Doña Rodriguez; but if he should be vanquished his opponentwas released from the promise that was claimed against him and from allobligations to give satisfaction. The master of the ceremonies apportionedthe sun to them, and stationed them, each on the spot where he was tostand. The drums beat, the sound of the trumpets filled the air, the earthtrembled under foot, the hearts of the gazing crowd were full of anxiety,some hoping for a happy issue, some apprehensive of an untoward ending tothe affair, and lastly, Don Quixote, commending himself with all his heartto God our Lord and to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, stood waiting forthem to give the necessary signal for the onset. Our lacquey, however, wasthinking of something very different; he only thought of what I am nowgoing to mention.</p><p>It seems that as he stood contemplating his enemy she struck him as themost beautiful woman he had ever seen all his life; and the little blindboy whom in our streets they commonly call Love had no mind to let slipthe chance of triumphing over a lacquey heart, and adding it to the listof his trophies; and so, stealing gently upon him unseen, he drove a darttwo yards long into the poor lacquey&rsquo;s left side and pierced hisheart through and through; which he was able to do quite at his ease, forLove is invisible, and comes in and goes out as he likes, without anyonecalling him to account for what he does. Well then, when they gave thesignal for the onset our lacquey was in an ecstasy, musing upon the beautyof her whom he had already made mistress of his liberty, and so he paid noattention to the sound of the trumpet, unlike Don Quixote, who was off theinstant he heard it, and, at the highest speed Rocinante was capable of,set out to meet his enemy, his good squire Sancho shouting lustily as hesaw him start, &ldquo;God guide thee, cream and flower of knights-errant!God give thee the victory, for thou hast the right on thy side!&rdquo; Butthough Tosilos saw Don Quixote coming at him he never stirred a step fromthe spot where he was posted; and instead of doing so called loudly to themarshal of the field, to whom when he came up to see what he wanted hesaid, &ldquo;Señor, is not this battle to decide whether I marry or do notmarry that lady?&rdquo; &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Wellthen,&rdquo; said the lacquey, &ldquo;I feel qualms of conscience, and Ishould lay a heavy burden upon it if I were to proceed any further withthe combat; I therefore declare that I yield myself vanquished, and that Iam willing to marry the lady at once.&rdquo;</p><p>The marshal of the field was lost in astonishment at the words of Tosilos;and as he was one of those who were privy to the arrangement of the affairhe knew not what to say in reply. Don Quixote pulled up in mid career whenhe saw that his enemy was not coming on to the attack. The duke could notmake out the reason why the battle did not go on; but the marshal of thefield hastened to him to let him know what Tosilos said, and he was amazedand extremely angry at it. In the meantime Tosilos advanced to where DoñaRodriguez sat and said in a loud voice, &ldquo;Señora, I am willing tomarry your daughter, and I have no wish to obtain by strife and fightingwhat I can obtain in peace and without any risk to my life.&rdquo;</p><p>The valiant Don Quixote heard him, and said, &ldquo;As that is the case Iam released and absolved from my promise; let them marry by all means, andas &lsquo;God our Lord has given her, may Saint Peter add his blessing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The duke had now descended to the courtyard of the castle, and going up toTosilos he said to him, &ldquo;Is it true, sir knight, that you yieldyourself vanquished, and that moved by scruples of conscience you wish tomarry this damsel?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is, señor,&rdquo; replied Tosilos.</p><p>&ldquo;And he does well,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for what thou hast togive to the mouse, give to the cat, and it will save thee all trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>Tosilos meanwhile was trying to unlace his helmet, and he begged them tocome to his help at once, as his power of breathing was failing him, andhe could not remain so long shut up in that confined space. They removedit in all haste, and his lacquey features were revealed to public gaze. Atthis sight Doña Rodriguez and her daughter raised a mighty outcry,exclaiming, &ldquo;This is a trick! This is a trick! They have putTosilos, my lord the duke&rsquo;s lacquey, upon us in place of the realhusband. The justice of God and the king against such trickery, not to sayroguery!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do not distress yourselves, ladies,&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;for this is no trickery or roguery; or if it is, it is not the dukewho is at the bottom of it, but those wicked enchanters who persecute me,and who, jealous of my reaping the glory of this victory, have turned yourhusband&rsquo;s features into those of this person, who you say is alacquey of the duke&rsquo;s; take my advice, and notwithstanding themalice of my enemies marry him, for beyond a doubt he is the one you wishfor a husband.&rdquo;</p><p>When the duke heard this all his anger was near vanishing in a fit oflaughter, and he said, &ldquo;The things that happen to Señor Don Quixoteare so extraordinary that I am ready to believe this lacquey of mine isnot one; but let us adopt this plan and device; let us put off themarriage for, say, a fortnight, and let us keep this person about whom weare uncertain in close confinement, and perhaps in the course of that timehe may return to his original shape; for the spite which the enchantersentertain against Señor Don Quixote cannot last so long, especially as itis of so little advantage to them to practise these deceptions andtransformations.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;those scoundrels are wellused to changing whatever concerns my master from one thing into another.A knight that he overcame some time back, called the Knight of theMirrors, they turned into the shape of the bachelor Samson Carrasco of ourtown and a great friend of ours; and my lady Dulcinea del Toboso they haveturned into a common country wench; so I suspect this lacquey will have tolive and die a lacquey all the days of his life.&rdquo;</p><p>Here the Rodriguez&rsquo;s daughter exclaimed, &ldquo;Let him be who hemay, this man that claims me for a wife; I am thankful to him for thesame, for I had rather be the lawful wife of a lacquey than the cheatedmistress of a gentleman; though he who played me false is nothing of thekind.&rdquo;</p><p>To be brief, all the talk and all that had happened ended in Tosilos beingshut up until it was seen how his transformation turned out. All hailedDon Quixote as victor, but the greater number were vexed and disappointedat finding that the combatants they had been so anxiously waiting for hadnot battered one another to pieces, just as the boys are disappointed whenthe man they are waiting to see hanged does not come out, because theprosecution or the court has pardoned him. The people dispersed, the dukeand Don Quixote returned to the castle, they locked up Tosilos, DoñaRodriguez and her daughter remained perfectly contented when they saw thatany way the affair must end in marriage, and Tosilos wanted nothing else.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p56e" id="p56e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p56e.jpg (46K)" src="images/p56e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch57b" id="ch57b"></a>CHAPTER LVII.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF HOW DON QUIXOTE TOOK LEAVE OF THE DUKE, AND OF WHATFOLLOWED WITH THE WITTY AND IMPUDENT ALTISIDORA, ONE OF THE DUCHESS&rsquo;SDAMSELS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p57a" id="p57a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p57a.jpg (119K)" src="images/p57a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p57a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote now felt it right to quit a life of such idleness as he wasleading in the castle; for he fancied that he was making himself sorelymissed by suffering himself to remain shut up and inactive amid thecountless luxuries and enjoyments his hosts lavished upon him as a knight,and he felt too that he would have to render a strict account to heaven ofthat indolence and seclusion; and so one day he asked the duke and duchessto grant him permission to take his departure.

Still I&rsquo;m glad to see my Teresa behaved as sheought in sending the acorns, for if she had not sent them I&rsquo;d havebeen sorry, and she&rsquo;d have shown herself ungrateful. It is a comfortto me that they can&rsquo;t call that present a bribe; for I had got thegovernment already when she sent them, and it&rsquo;s but reasonable thatthose who have had a good turn done them should show their gratitude, ifit&rsquo;s only with a trifle.

The whole household of the castle were watching him from thecorridors, and the duke and duchess, too, came out to see him. Sancho wasmounted on his Dapple, with his alforjas, valise, and proven supremelyhappy because the duke&rsquo;s majordomo, the same that had acted the partof the Trifaldi, had given him a little purse with two hundred gold crownsto meet the necessary expenses of the road, but of this Don Quixote knewnothing as yet. While all were, as has been said, observing him, suddenlyfrom among the duennas and handmaidens the impudent and witty Altisidoralifted up her voice and said in pathetic tones:</p><p class="poem">Give ear, cruel knight;<br/>Draw rein; where&rsquo;s the need<br/>Of spurring the flanks<br/>Of that ill-broken steed?<br/>From what art thou flying?<br/>No dragon I am,<br/>Not even a sheep,<br/>But a tender young lamb.<br/>Thou hast jilted a maiden<br/>As fair to behold<br/>As nymph of Diana<br/>Or Venus of old.<br/>Bireno, Æneas, what worse shall I call thee?<br/>Barabbas go with thee!

The duke had a mind to keep up thesport, so he said, &ldquo;It does not seem to me well done in you, sirknight, that after having received the hospitality that has been offeredyou in this very castle, you should have ventured to carry off even threekerchiefs, not to say my handmaid&rsquo;s garters. It shows a bad heartand does not tally with your reputation. Restore her garters, or else Idefy you to mortal combat, for I am not afraid of rascally enchanterschanging or altering my features as they changed his who encountered youinto those of my lacquey, Tosilos.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God forbid,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that I should draw mysword against your illustrious person from which I have received suchgreat favours. The kerchiefs I will restore, as Sancho says he has them;as to the garters that is impossible, for I have not got them, neither hashe; and if your handmaiden here will look in her hiding-places, dependupon it she will find them. I have never been a thief, my lord duke, nordo I mean to be so long as I live, if God cease not to have me in hiskeeping. This damsel by her own confession speaks as one in love, forwhich I am not to blame, and therefore need not ask pardon, either of heror of your excellence, whom I entreat to have a better opinion of me, andonce more to give me leave to pursue my journey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And may God so prosper it, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; said theduchess, &ldquo;that we may always hear good news of your exploits; Godspeed you; for the longer you stay, the more you inflame the hearts of thedamsels who behold you; and as for this one of mine, I will so chastiseher that she will not transgress again, either with her eyes or with herwords.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One word and no more, O valiant Don Quixote, I ask you to hear,&rdquo;said Altisidora, &ldquo;and that is that I beg your pardon about the theftof the garters; for by God and upon my soul I have got them on, and I havefallen into the same blunder as he did who went looking for his ass beingall the while mounted on it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say so?&rdquo; said Sancho. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m alikely one to hide thefts! Why if I wanted to deal in them, opportunitiescame ready enough to me in my government.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote bowed his head, and saluted the duke and duchess and all thebystanders, and wheeling Rocinante round, Sancho following him on Dapple,he rode out of the castle, shaping his course for Saragossa.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p57e" id="p57e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p57e.jpg (71K)" src="images/p57e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch58b" id="ch58b"></a>CHAPTER LVIII.<br/>WHICH TELLS HOW ADVENTURES CAME CROWDING ON DON QUIXOTE IN SUCH NUMBERSTHAT THEY GAVE ONE ANOTHER NO BREATHING-TIME</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p58a" id="p58a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p58a.jpg (105K)" src="images/p58a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p58a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>When Don Quixote saw himself in open country, free, and relieved from theattentions of Altisidora, he felt at his ease, and in fresh spirits totake up the pursuit of chivalry once more; and turning to Sancho, he said,&ldquo;Freedom, Sancho, is one of the most precious gifts that heaven hasbestowed upon men; no treasures that the earth holds buried or the seaconceals can compare with it; for freedom, as for honour, life may andshould be ventured; and on the other hand, captivity is the greatest evilthat can fall to the lot of man. I say this, Sancho, because thou hastseen the good cheer, the abundance we have enjoyed in this castle we areleaving; well then, amid those dainty banquets and snow-cooled beverages Ifelt as though I were undergoing the straits of hunger, because I did notenjoy them with the same freedom as if they had been mine own; for thesense of being under an obligation to return benefits and favours receivedis a restraint that checks the independence of the spirit. Happy he, towhom heaven has given a piece of bread for which he is not bound to givethanks to any but heaven itself!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all your worship says,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;it is notbecoming that there should be no thanks on our part for two hundred goldcrowns that the duke&rsquo;s majordomo has given me in a little pursewhich I carry next my heart, like a warming plaster or comforter, to meetany chance calls; for we shan&rsquo;t always find castles where they&rsquo;llentertain us; now and then we may light upon roadside inns where they&rsquo;llcudgel us.&rdquo;</p><p>In conversation of this sort the knight and squire errant were pursuingtheir journey, when, after they had gone a little more than half a league,they perceived some dozen men dressed like labourers stretched upon theircloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner. They had besidethem what seemed to be white sheets concealing some objects under them,standing upright or lying flat, and arranged at intervals. Don Quixoteapproached the diners, and, saluting them courteously first, he asked themwhat it was those cloths covered. &ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; answered one of theparty, &ldquo;under these cloths are some images carved in relief intendedfor a retablo we are putting up in our village; we carry them covered upthat they may not be soiled, and on our shoulders that they may not bebroken.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With your good leave,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;I should liketo see them; for images that are carried so carefully no doubt must befine ones.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should think they were!&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;let themoney they cost speak for that; for as a matter of fact there is not oneof them that does not stand us in more than fifty ducats; and that yourworship may judge; wait a moment, and you shall see with your own eyes;&rdquo;and getting up from his dinner he went and uncovered the first image,which proved to be one of Saint George on horseback with a serpentwrithing at his feet and the lance thrust down its throat with all thatfierceness that is usually depicted. The whole group was one blaze ofgold, as the saying is. On seeing it Don Quixote said, &ldquo;That knightwas one of the best knights-errant the army of heaven ever owned; he wascalled Don Saint George, and he was moreover a defender of maidens. Let ussee this next one.&rdquo;</p><p>The man uncovered it, and it was seen to be that of Saint Martin on hishorse, dividing his cloak with the beggar. The instant Don Quixote saw ithe said, &ldquo;This knight too was one of the Christian adventurers, butI believe he was generous rather than valiant, as thou mayest perceive,Sancho, by his dividing his cloak with the beggar and giving him half ofit; no doubt it was winter at the time, for otherwise he would have givenhim the whole of it, so charitable was he.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was not that, most likely,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but thathe held with the proverb that says, &lsquo;For giving and keeping there&rsquo;sneed of brains.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote laughed, and asked them to take off the next cloth, underneathwhich was seen the image of the patron saint of the Spains seated onhorseback, his sword stained with blood, trampling on Moors and treadingheads underfoot; and on seeing it Don Quixote exclaimed, &ldquo;Ay, thisis a knight, and of the squadrons of Christ! This one is called Don SaintJames the Moorslayer, one of the bravest saints and knights the world everhad or heaven has now.&rdquo;</p><p>They then raised another cloth which it appeared covered Saint Paulfalling from his horse, with all the details that are usually given inrepresentations of his conversion. When Don Quixote saw it, rendered insuch lifelike style that one would have said Christ was speaking and Paulanswering, &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was in his time thegreatest enemy that the Church of God our Lord had, and the greatestchampion it will ever have; a knight-errant in life, a steadfast saint indeath, an untiring labourer in the Lord&rsquo;s vineyard, a teacher of theGentiles, whose school was heaven, and whose instructor and master wasJesus Christ himself.&rdquo;</p><p>There were no more images, so Don Quixote bade them cover them up again,and said to those who had brought them, &ldquo;I take it as a happy omen,brothers, to have seen what I have; for these saints and knights were ofthe same profession as myself, which is the calling of arms; only there isthis difference between them and me, that they were saints, and foughtwith divine weapons, and I am a sinner and fight with human ones. They wonheaven by force of arms, for heaven suffereth violence; and I, so far,know not what I have won by dint of my sufferings; but if my Dulcinea delToboso were to be released from hers, perhaps with mended fortunes and amind restored to itself I might direct my steps in a better path than I amfollowing at present.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May God hear and sin be deaf,&rdquo; said Sancho to this.</p><p>The men were filled with wonder, as well at the figure as at the words ofDon Quixote, though they did not understand one half of what he meant bythem. They finished their dinner, took their images on their backs, andbidding farewell to Don Quixote resumed their journey.</p><p>Sancho was amazed afresh at the extent of his master&rsquo;s knowledge, asmuch as if he had never known him, for it seemed to him that there was nostory or event in the world that he had not at his fingers&rsquo; ends andfixed in his memory, and he said to him, &ldquo;In truth, master mine, ifthis that has happened to us to-day is to be called an adventure, it hasbeen one of the sweetest and pleasantest that have befallen us in thewhole course of our travels; we have come out of it unbelaboured andundismayed, neither have we drawn sword nor have we smitten the earth withour bodies, nor have we been left famishing; blessed be God that he haslet me see such a thing with my own eyes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou sayest well, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;butremember all times are not alike nor do they always run the same way; andthese things the vulgar commonly call omens, which are not based upon anynatural reason, will by him who is wise be esteemed and reckoned happyaccidents merely. One of these believers in omens will get up of amorning, leave his house, and meet a friar of the order of the blessedSaint Francis, and, as if he had met a griffin, he will turn about and gohome. With another Mendoza the salt is spilt on his table, and gloom isspilt over his heart, as if nature was obliged to give warning of comingmisfortunes by means of such trivial things as these. The wise man and theChristian should not trifle with what it may please heaven to do. Scipioon coming to Africa stumbled as he leaped on shore; his soldiers took itas a bad omen; but he, clasping the soil with his arms, exclaimed, &lsquo;Thoucanst not escape me, Africa, for I hold thee tight between my arms.&rsquo;Thus, Sancho, meeting those images has been to me a most happy occurrence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can well believe it,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;but I wish yourworship would tell me what is the reason that the Spaniards, when they areabout to give battle, in calling on that Saint James the Moorslayer, say&lsquo;Santiago and close Spain!&rsquo; Is Spain, then, open, so that itis needful to close it; or what is the meaning of this form?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art very simple, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;God,look you, gave that great knight of the Red Cross to Spain as her patronsaint and protector, especially in those hard struggles the Spaniards hadwith the Moors; and therefore they invoke and call upon him as theirdefender in all their battles; and in these he has been many a time seenbeating down, trampling under foot, destroying and slaughtering theHagarene squadrons in the sight of all; of which fact I could give theemany examples recorded in truthful Spanish histories.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho changed the subject, and said to his master, &ldquo;I marvel,señor, at the boldness of Altisidora, the duchess&rsquo;s handmaid; hewhom they call Love must have cruelly pierced and wounded her; they say heis a little blind urchin who, though blear-eyed, or more properly speakingsightless, if he aims at a heart, be it ever so small, hits it and piercesit through and through with his arrows. I have heard it said too that thearrows of Love are blunted and robbed of their points by maidenly modestyand reserve; but with this Altisidora it seems they are sharpened ratherthan blunted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bear in mind, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that love isinfluenced by no consideration, recognises no restraints of reason, and isof the same nature as death, that assails alike the lofty palaces of kingsand the humble cabins of shepherds; and when it takes entire possession ofa heart, the first thing it does is to banish fear and shame from it; andso without shame Altisidora declared her passion, which excited in my mindembarrassment rather than commiseration.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Notable cruelty!&rdquo; exclaimed Sancho; &ldquo;unheard-ofingratitude! I can only say for myself that the very smallest loving wordof hers would have subdued me and made a slave of me. The devil! What aheart of marble, what bowels of brass, what a soul of mortar! But I can&rsquo;timagine what it is that this damsel saw in your worship that could haveconquered and captivated her so. What gallant figure was it, what boldbearing, what sprightly grace, what comeliness of feature, which of thesethings by itself, or what all together, could have made her fall in lovewith you? For indeed and in truth many a time I stop to look at yourworship from the sole of your foot to the topmost hair of your head, and Isee more to frighten one than to make one fall in love; moreover I haveheard say that beauty is the first and main thing that excites love, andas your worship has none at all, I don&rsquo;t know what the poor creaturefell in love with.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Recollect, Sancho,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;there are twosorts of beauty, one of the mind, the other of the body; that of the minddisplays and exhibits itself in intelligence, in modesty, in honourableconduct, in generosity, in good breeding; and all these qualities arepossible and may exist in an ugly man; and when it is this sort of beautyand not that of the body that is the attraction, love is apt to spring upsuddenly and violently. I, Sancho, perceive clearly enough that I am notbeautiful, but at the same time I know I am not hideous; and it is enoughfor an honest man not to be a monster to be an object of love, if only hepossesses the endowments of mind I have mentioned.&rdquo;</p><p>While engaged in this discourse they were making their way through a woodthat lay beyond the road, when suddenly, without expecting anything of thekind, Don Quixote found himself caught in some nets of green cordstretched from one tree to another; and unable to conceive what it couldbe, he said to Sancho, &ldquo;Sancho, it strikes me this affair of thesenets will prove one of the strangest adventures imaginable. May I die ifthe enchanters that persecute me are not trying to entangle me in them anddelay my journey, by way of revenge for my obduracy towards Altisidora.Well then let me tell them that if these nets, instead of being greencord, were made of the hardest diamonds, or stronger than that wherewiththe jealous god of blacksmiths enmeshed Venus and Mars, I would break themas easily as if they were made of rushes or cotton threads.&rdquo; Butjust as he was about to press forward and break through all, suddenly fromamong some trees two shepherdesses of surpassing beauty presentedthemselves to his sight&mdash;or at least damsels dressed likeshepherdesses, save that their jerkins and sayas were of fine brocade;that is to say, the sayas were rich farthingales of gold embroideredtabby. Their hair, that in its golden brightness vied with the beams ofthe sun itself, fell loose upon their shoulders and was crowned withgarlands twined with green laurel and red everlasting; and their years toall appearance were not under fifteen nor above eighteen.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p58b" id="p58b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p58b.jpg (452K)" src="images/p58b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p58b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Such was the spectacle that filled Sancho with amazement, fascinated DonQuixote, made the sun halt in his course to behold them, and held all fourin a strange silence. One of the shepherdesses, at length, was the firstto speak and said to Don Quixote, &ldquo;Hold, sir knight, and do notbreak these nets; for they are not spread here to do you any harm, butonly for our amusement; and as I know you will ask why they have been putup, and who we are, I will tell you in a few words. In a village some twoleagues from this, where there are many people of quality and richgentlefolk, it was agreed upon by a number of friends and relations tocome with their wives, sons and daughters, neighbours, friends andkinsmen, and make holiday in this spot, which is one of the pleasantest inthe whole neighbourhood, setting up a new pastoral Arcadia amongourselves, we maidens dressing ourselves as shepherdesses and the youthsas shepherds. We have prepared two eclogues, one by the famous poetGarcilasso, the other by the most excellent Camoens, in its own Portuguesetongue, but we have not as yet acted them. Yesterday was the first day ofour coming here; we have a few of what they say are called field-tentspitched among the trees on the bank of an ample brook that fertilises allthese meadows; last night we spread these nets in the trees here to snarethe silly little birds that startled by the noise we make may fly intothem. If you please to be our guest, señor, you will be welcomed heartilyand courteously, for here just now neither care nor sorrow shall enter.&rdquo;</p><p>She held her peace and said no more, and Don Quixote made answer, &ldquo;Ofa truth, fairest lady, Actaeon when he unexpectedly beheld Diana bathingin the stream could not have been more fascinated and wonderstruck than Iat the sight of your beauty. I commend your mode of entertainment, andthank you for the kindness of your invitation; and if I can serve you, youmay command me with full confidence of being obeyed, for my profession isnone other than to show myself grateful, and ready to serve persons of allconditions, but especially persons of quality such as your appearanceindicates; and if, instead of taking up, as they probably do, but a smallspace, these nets took up the whole surface of the globe, I would seek outnew worlds through which to pass, so as not to break them; and that ye maygive some degree of credence to this exaggerated language of mine, knowthat it is no less than Don Quixote of La Mancha that makes thisdeclaration to you, if indeed it be that such a name has reached yourears.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! friend of my soul,&rdquo; instantly exclaimed the othershepherdess, &ldquo;what great good fortune has befallen us! Seest thouthis gentleman we have before us? Well then let me tell thee he is themost valiant and the most devoted and the most courteous gentleman in allthe world, unless a history of his achievements that has been printed andI have read is telling lies and deceiving us. I will lay a wager that thisgood fellow who is with him is one Sancho Panza his squire, whosedrolleries none can equal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I am that same drolland squire you speak of, and this gentleman is my master Don Quixote of LaMancha, the same that&rsquo;s in the history and that they talk about.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, my friend,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;let us entreat him tostay; for it will give our fathers and brothers infinite pleasure; I toohave heard just what thou hast told me of the valour of the one and thedrolleries of the other; and what is more, of him they say that he is themost constant and loyal lover that was ever heard of, and that his lady isone Dulcinea del Toboso, to whom all over Spain the palm of beauty isawarded.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And justly awarded,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;unless, indeed,your unequalled beauty makes it a matter of doubt. But spare yourselvesthe trouble, ladies, of pressing me to stay, for the urgent calls of myprofession do not allow me to take rest under any circumstances.&rdquo;</p><p>At this instant there came up to the spot where the four stood a brotherof one of the two shepherdesses, like them in shepherd costume, and asrichly and gaily dressed as they were. They told him that their companionwas the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha, and the other Sancho his squire,of whom he knew already from having read their history. The gay shepherdoffered him his services and begged that he would accompany him to theirtents, and Don Quixote had to give way and comply. And now the game wasstarted, and the nets were filled with a variety of birds that deceived bythe colour fell into the danger they were flying from. Upwards of thirtypersons, all gaily attired as shepherds and shepherdesses, assembled onthe spot, and were at once informed who Don Quixote and his squire were,whereat they were not a little delighted, as they knew of him alreadythrough his history. They repaired to the tents, where they found tableslaid out, and choicely, plentifully, and neatly furnished. They treatedDon Quixote as a person of distinction, giving him the place of honour,and all observed him, and were full of astonishment at the spectacle. Atlast the cloth being removed, Don Quixote with great composure lifted uphis voice and said:</p><p>&ldquo;One of the greatest sins that men are guilty of is&mdash;some willsay pride&mdash;but I say ingratitude, going by the common saying thathell is full of ingrates. This sin, so far as it has lain in my power, Ihave endeavoured to avoid ever since I have enjoyed the faculty of reason;and if I am unable to requite good deeds that have been done me by otherdeeds, I substitute the desire to do so; and if that be not enough I makethem known publicly; for he who declares and makes known the good deedsdone to him would repay them by others if it were in his power, and forthe most part those who receive are the inferiors of those who give. Thus,God is superior to all because he is the supreme giver, and the offeringsof man fall short by an infinite distance of being a full return for thegifts of God; but gratitude in some degree makes up for this deficiencyand shortcoming. I therefore, grateful for the favour that has beenextended to me here, and unable to make a return in the same measure,restricted as I am by the narrow limits of my power, offer what I can andwhat I have to offer in my own way; and so I declare that for two fulldays I will maintain in the middle of this highway leading to Saragossa,that these ladies disguised as shepherdesses, who are here present, arethe fairest and most courteous maidens in the world, excepting only thepeerless Dulcinea del Toboso, sole mistress of my thoughts, be it saidwithout offence to those who hear me, ladies and gentlemen.&rdquo;</p><p>On hearing this Sancho, who had been listening with great attention, criedout in a loud voice, &ldquo;Is it possible there is anyone in the worldwho will dare to say and swear that this master of mine is a madman? Say,gentlemen shepherds, is there a village priest, be he ever so wise orlearned, who could say what my master has said; or is there knight-errant,whatever renown he may have as a man of valour, that could offer what mymaster has offered now?&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote turned upon Sancho, and with a countenance glowing with angersaid to him, &ldquo;Is it possible, Sancho, there is anyone in the wholeworld who will say thou art not a fool, with a lining to match, and I knownot what trimmings of impertinence and roguery? Who asked thee to meddlein my affairs, or to inquire whether I am a wise man or a blockhead? Holdthy peace; answer me not a word; saddle Rocinante if he be unsaddled; andlet us go to put my offer into execution; for with the right that I haveon my side thou mayest reckon as vanquished all who shall venture toquestion it;&rdquo; and in a great rage, and showing his anger plainly, herose from his seat, leaving the company lost in wonder, and making themfeel doubtful whether they ought to regard him as a madman or a rationalbeing. In the end, though they sought to dissuade him from involvinghimself in such a challenge, assuring him they admitted his gratitude asfully established, and needed no fresh proofs to be convinced of hisvaliant spirit, as those related in the history of his exploits weresufficient, still Don Quixote persisted in his resolve; and mounted onRocinante, bracing his buckler on his arm and grasping his lance, heposted himself in the middle of a high road that was not far from thegreen meadow. Sancho followed on Dapple, together with all the members ofthe pastoral gathering, eager to see what would be the upshot of hisvainglorious and extraordinary proposal.</p><p>Don Quixote, then, having, as has been said, planted himself in the middleof the road, made the welkin ring with words to this effect: &ldquo;Ho yetravellers and wayfarers, knights, squires, folk on foot or on horseback,who pass this way or shall pass in the course of the next two days! Knowthat Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant, is posted here to maintainby arms that the beauty and courtesy enshrined in the nymphs that dwell inthese meadows and groves surpass all upon earth, putting aside the lady ofmy heart, Dulcinea del Toboso. Wherefore, let him who is of the oppositeopinion come on, for here I await him.&rdquo;</p><p>Twice he repeated the same words, and twice they fell unheard by anyadventurer; but fate, that was guiding affairs for him from better tobetter, so ordered it that shortly afterwards there appeared on the road acrowd of men on horseback, many of them with lances in their hands, allriding in a compact body and in great haste. No sooner had those who werewith Don Quixote seen them than they turned about and withdrew to somedistance from the road, for they knew that if they stayed some harm mightcome to them; but Don Quixote with intrepid heart stood his ground, andSancho Panza shielded himself with Rocinante&rsquo;s hind-quarters. Thetroop of lancers came up, and one of them who was in advance beganshouting to Don Quixote, &ldquo;Get out of the way, you son of the devil,or these bulls will knock you to pieces!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rabble!&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;I care nothing forbulls, be they the fiercest Jarama breeds on its banks. Confess at once,scoundrels, that what I have declared is true; else ye have to deal withme in combat.&rdquo;</p><p>The herdsman had no time to reply, nor Don Quixote to get out of the wayeven if he wished; and so the drove of fierce bulls and tame bullocks,together with the crowd of herdsmen and others who were taking them to bepenned up in a village where they were to be run the next day, passed overDon Quixote and over Sancho, Rocinante and Dapple, hurling them all to theearth and rolling them over on the ground. Sancho was left crushed, DonQuixote scared, Dapple belaboured and Rocinante in no very soundcondition.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p58c" id="p58c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p58c.jpg (399K)" src="images/p58c.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p58c.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>They all got up, however, at length, and Don Quixote in great haste,stumbling here and falling there, started off running after the drove,shouting out, &ldquo;Hold! stay! ye rascally rabble, a single knightawaits you, and he is not of the temper or opinion of those who say,&lsquo;For a flying enemy make a bridge of silver.&rsquo;&rdquo; Theretreating party in their haste, however, did not stop for that, or heedhis menaces any more than last year&rsquo;s clouds. Weariness brought DonQuixote to a halt, and more enraged than avenged he sat down on the roadto wait until Sancho, Rocinante and Dapple came up. When they reached himmaster and man mounted once more, and without going back to bid farewellto the mock or imitation Arcadia, and more in humiliation thancontentment, they continued their journey.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p58e" id="p58e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p58e.jpg (68K)" src="images/p58e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p58e.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch59b" id="ch59b"></a>CHAPTER LIX.<br/>WHEREIN IS RELATED THE STRANGE THING, WHICH MAY BE REGARDED AS ANADVENTURE, THAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p59a" id="p59a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p59a.jpg (126K)" src="images/p59a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p59a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>A clear limpid spring which they discovered in a cool grove relieved DonQuixote and Sancho of the dust and fatigue due to the unpolite behaviourof the bulls, and by the side of this, having turned Dapple and Rocinanteloose without headstall or bridle, the forlorn pair, master and man,seated themselves. Sancho had recourse to the larder of his alforjas andtook out of them what he called the prog; Don Quixote rinsed his mouth andbathed his face, by which cooling process his flagging energies wererevived.

I was born,Sancho, to live dying, and thou to die eating; and to prove the truth ofwhat I say, look at me, printed in histories, famed in arms, courteous inbehaviour, honoured by princes, courted by maidens; and after all, when Ilooked forward to palms, triumphs, and crowns, won and earned by myvaliant deeds, I have this morning seen myself trampled on, kicked, andcrushed by the feet of unclean and filthy animals. This thought blunts myteeth, paralyses my jaws, cramps my hands, and robs me of all appetite forfood; so much so that I have a mind to let myself die of hunger, thecruelest death of all deaths.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So then,&rdquo; said Sancho, munching hard all the time, &ldquo;yourworship does not agree with the proverb that says, &lsquo;Let Martha die,but let her die with a full belly.&rsquo; I, at any rate, have no mind tokill myself; so far from that, I mean to do as the cobbler does, whostretches the leather with his teeth until he makes it reach as far as hewants. I&rsquo;ll stretch out my life by eating until it reaches the endheaven has fixed for it; and let me tell you, señor, there&rsquo;s nogreater folly than to think of dying of despair as your worship does; takemy advice, and after eating lie down and sleep a bit on this greengrass-mattress, and you will see that when you awake you&rsquo;ll feelsomething better.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote did as he recommended, for it struck him that Sancho&rsquo;sreasoning was more like a philosopher&rsquo;s than a blockhead&rsquo;s,and said he, &ldquo;Sancho, if thou wilt do for me what I am going to tellthee my ease of mind would be more assured and my heaviness of heart notso great; and it is this; to go aside a little while I am sleeping inaccordance with thy advice, and, making bare thy carcase to the air, togive thyself three or four hundred lashes with Rocinante&rsquo;s reins, onaccount of the three thousand and odd thou art to give thyself for thedisenchantment of Dulcinea; for it is a great pity that the poor ladyshould be left enchanted through thy carelessness and negligence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is a good deal to be said on that point,&rdquo; said Sancho;&ldquo;let us both go to sleep now, and after that, God has decreed whatwill happen. Let me tell your worship that for a man to whip himself incold blood is a hard thing, especially if the stripes fall upon anill-nourished and worse-fed body. Let my lady Dulcinea have patience, andwhen she is least expecting it, she will see me made a riddle of withwhipping, and &lsquo;until death it&rsquo;s all life;&rsquo; I mean that Ihave still life in me, and the desire to make good what I have promised.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote thanked him, and ate a little, and Sancho a good deal, andthen they both lay down to sleep, leaving those two inseparable friendsand comrades, Rocinante and Dapple, to their own devices and to feedunrestrained upon the abundant grass with which the meadow was furnished.They woke up rather late, mounted once more and resumed their journey,pushing on to reach an inn which was in sight, apparently a league off. Isay an inn, because Don Quixote called it so, contrary to his usualpractice of calling all inns castles. They reached it, and asked thelandlord if they could put up there. He said yes, with as much comfort andas good fare as they could find in Saragossa. They dismounted, and Sanchostowed away his larder in a room of which the landlord gave him the key.He took the beasts to the stable, fed them, and came back to see whatorders Don Quixote, who was seated on a bench at the door, had for him,giving special thanks to heaven that this inn had not been taken for acastle by his master. Supper-time came, and they repaired to their room,and Sancho asked the landlord what he had to give them for supper. To thisthe landlord replied that his mouth should be the measure; he had only toask what he would; for that inn was provided with the birds of the air andthe fowls of the earth and the fish of the sea.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need of all that,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;ifthey&rsquo;ll roast us a couple of chickens we&rsquo;ll be satisfied, formy master is delicate and eats little, and I&rsquo;m not over and abovegluttonous.&rdquo;</p><p>The landlord replied he had no chickens, for the kites had stolen them.</p><p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;let señor landlord tell themto roast a pullet, so that it is a tender one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pullet! My father!&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;indeed and intruth it&rsquo;s only yesterday I sent over fifty to the city to sell; butsaving pullets ask what you will.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;you will not be withoutveal or kid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just now,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s none inthe house, for it&rsquo;s all finished; but next week there will be enoughand to spare.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Much good that does us,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay abet that all these short-comings are going to wind up in plenty of baconand eggs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;my guest&rsquo;s wits mustbe precious dull; I tell him I have neither pullets nor hens, and he wantsme to have eggs! Talk of other dainties, if you please, and don&rsquo;task for hens again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Body o&rsquo; me!&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s settle thematter; say at once what you have got, and let us have no more words aboutit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In truth and earnest, señor guest,&rdquo; said the landlord,&ldquo;all I have is a couple of cow-heels like calves&rsquo; feet, or acouple of calves&rsquo; feet like cowheels; they are boiled withchick-peas, onions, and bacon, and at this moment they are crying &lsquo;Comeeat me, come eat me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mark them for mine on the spot,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;letnobody touch them; I&rsquo;ll pay better for them than anyone else, for Icould not wish for anything more to my taste; and I don&rsquo;t care a pinwhether they are feet or heels.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody shall touch them,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;for theother guests I have, being persons of high quality, bring their own cookand caterer and larder with them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you come to people of quality,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;there&rsquo;snobody more so than my master; but the calling he follows does not allowof larders or store-rooms; we lay ourselves down in the middle of ameadow, and fill ourselves with acorns or medlars.&rdquo;</p><p>Here ended Sancho&rsquo;s conversation with the landlord, Sancho notcaring to carry it any farther by answering him; for he had already askedhim what calling or what profession it was his master was of.</p><p>Supper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room, thelandlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself downto sup very resolutely. It seems that in another room, which was next toDon Quixote&rsquo;s, with nothing but a thin partition to separate it, heoverheard these words, &ldquo;As you live, Señor Don Jeronimo, while theyare bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the Second Part of&lsquo;Don Quixote of La Mancha.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The instant Don Quixote heard his own name he started to his feet andlistened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heard theDon Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, &ldquo;Why would youhave us read that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible for anyonewho has read the First Part of the history of &lsquo;Don Quixote of LaMancha&rsquo; to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said he who was addressed as Don Juan, &ldquo;weshall do well to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has somethinggood in it. What displeases me most in it is that it represents DonQuixote as now cured of his love for Dulcinea del Toboso.&rdquo;</p><p>On hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up hisvoice and said, &ldquo;Whoever he may be who says that Don Quixote of LaMancha has forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teach himwith equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for neithercan the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor can forgetfulnesshave a place in Don Quixote; his motto is constancy, and his profession tomaintain the same with his life and never wrong it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is this that answers us?&rdquo; said they in the next room.</p><p>&ldquo;Who should it be,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but Don Quixote of LaMancha himself, who will make good all he has said and all he will say;for pledges don&rsquo;t trouble a good payer.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such theyseemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his arms roundDon Quixote&rsquo;s neck, said to him, &ldquo;Your appearance cannot leaveany question as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify yourappearance; unquestionably, señor, you are the real Don Quixote of LaMancha, cynosure and morning star of knight-errantry, despite and indefiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught yourachievements, as the author of this book which I here present to you hasdone;&rdquo; and with this he put a book which his companion carried intothe hands of Don Quixote, who took it, and without replying began to runhis eye over it; but he presently returned it saying, &ldquo;In the littleI have seen I have discovered three things in this author that deserve tobe censured. The first is some words that I have read in the preface; thenext that the language is Aragonese, for sometimes he writes withoutarticles; and the third, which above all stamps him as ignorant, is thathe goes wrong and departs from the truth in the most important part of thehistory, for here he says that my squire Sancho Panza&rsquo;s wife iscalled Mari Gutierrez, when she is called nothing of the sort, but TeresaPanza; and when a man errs on such an important point as this there isgood reason to fear that he is in error on every other point in thehistory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A nice sort of historian, indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Sancho at this;&ldquo;he must know a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife TeresaPanza, Mari Gutierrez; take the book again, señor, and see if I am in itand if he has changed my name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From your talk, friend,&rdquo; said Don Jeronimo, &ldquo;no doubtyou are Sancho Panza, Señor Don Quixote&rsquo;s squire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m proud of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Faith, then,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;this new author doesnot handle you with the decency that displays itself in your person; hemakes you out a heavy feeder and a fool, and not in the least droll, and avery different being from the Sancho described in the First Part of yourmaster&rsquo;s history.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God forgive him,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;he might have left mein my corner without troubling his head about me; &lsquo;let him who knowshow ring the bells; &lsquo;Saint Peter is very well in Rome.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The two gentlemen pressed Don Quixote to come into their room and havesupper with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn fitfor one of his sort. Don Quixote, who was always polite, yielded to theirrequest and supped with them. Sancho stayed behind with the stew. andinvested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at the head ofthe table, and the landlord sat down with him, for he was no less fond ofcow-heel and calves&rsquo; feet than Sancho was.</p><p>While at supper Don Juan asked Don Quixote what news he had of the ladyDulcinea del Toboso, was she married, had she been brought to bed, or wasshe with child, or did she in maidenhood, still preserving her modesty anddelicacy, cherish the remembrance of the tender passion of Señor DonQuixote?</p><p>To this he replied, &ldquo;Dulcinea is a maiden still, and my passion morefirmly rooted than ever, our intercourse unsatisfactory as before, and herbeauty transformed into that of a foul country wench;&rdquo; and then heproceeded to give them a full and particular account of the enchantment ofDulcinea, and of what had happened him in the cave of Montesinos, togetherwith what the sage Merlin had prescribed for her disenchantment, namelythe scourging of Sancho.</p><p>Exceedingly great was the amusement the two gentlemen derived from hearingDon Quixote recount the strange incidents of his history; and if they wereamazed by his absurdities they were equally amazed by the elegant style inwhich he delivered them. On the one hand they regarded him as a man of witand sense, and on the other he seemed to them a maundering blockhead, andthey could not make up their minds whereabouts between wisdom and follythey ought to place him.</p><p>Sancho having finished his supper, and left the landlord in the Xcondition, repaired to the room where his master was, and as he came insaid, &ldquo;May I die, sirs, if the author of this book your worshipshave got has any mind that we should agree; as he calls me glutton(according to what your worships say) I wish he may not call me drunkardtoo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But he does,&rdquo; said Don Jeronimo; &ldquo;I cannot remember,however, in what way, though I know his words are offensive, and what ismore, lying, as I can see plainly by the physiognomy of the worthy Sanchobefore me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;the Sancho and the DonQuixote of this history must be different persons from those that appearin the one Cide Hamete Benengeli wrote, who are ourselves; my mastervaliant, wise, and true in love, and I simple, droll, and neither gluttonnor drunkard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; said Don Juan; &ldquo;and were it possible, anorder should be issued that no one should have the presumption to dealwith anything relating to Don Quixote, save his original author CideHamete; just as Alexander commanded that no one should presume to painthis portrait save Apelles.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p60b" id="p60b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p60b.jpg (336K)" src="images/p60b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p60b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Let him who will paint me,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but lethim not abuse me; for patience will often break down when they heapinsults upon it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;None can be offered to Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; said Don Juan,&ldquo;that he himself will not be able to avenge, if he does not ward itoff with the shield of his patience, which, I take it, is great andstrong.&rdquo;</p><p>A considerable portion of the night passed in conversation of this sort,and though Don Juan wished Don Quixote to read more of the book to seewhat it was all about, he was not to be prevailed upon, saying that hetreated it as read and pronounced it utterly silly; and, if by any chanceit should come to its author&rsquo;s ears that he had it in his hand, hedid not want him to flatter himself with the idea that he had read it; forour thoughts, and still more our eyes, should keep themselves aloof fromwhat is obscene and filthy.</p><p>They asked him whither he meant to direct his steps. He replied, toSaragossa, to take part in the harness jousts which were held in that cityevery year. Don Juan told him that the new history described how DonQuixote, let him be who he might, took part there in a tilting at thering, utterly devoid of invention, poor in mottoes, very poor in costume,though rich in sillinesses.</p><p>&ldquo;For that very reason,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;I will notset foot in Saragossa; and by that means I shall expose to the world thelie of this new history writer, and people will see that I am not the DonQuixote he speaks of.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will do quite right,&rdquo; said Don Jeronimo; &ldquo;and thereare other jousts at Barcelona in which Señor Don Quixote may display hisprowess.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is what I mean to do,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;and asit is now time, I pray your worships to give me leave to retire to bed,and to place and retain me among the number of your greatest friends andservants.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And me too,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;maybe I&rsquo;ll be good forsomething.&rdquo;</p><p>With this they exchanged farewells, and Don Quixote and Sancho retired totheir room, leaving Don Juan and Don Jeronimo amazed to see the medley hemade of his good sense and his craziness; and they felt thoroughlyconvinced that these, and not those their Aragonese author described, werethe genuine Don Quixote and Sancho. Don Quixote rose betimes, and badeadieu to his hosts by knocking at the partition of the other room. Sanchopaid the landlord magnificently, and recommended him either to say lessabout the providing of his inn or to keep it better provided.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p59e" id="p59e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p59e.jpg (48K)" src="images/p59e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch60b" id="ch60b"></a>CHAPTER LX.<br/>OF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE ON HIS WAY TO BARCELONA</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p60a" id="p60a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p60a.jpg (129K)" src="images/p60a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p60a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>It was a fresh morning giving promise of a cool day as Don Quixote quittedthe inn, first of all taking care to ascertain the most direct road toBarcelona without touching upon Saragossa; so anxious was he to make outthis new historian, who they said abused him so, to be a liar. Well, as itfell out, nothing worthy of being recorded happened him for six days, atthe end of which, having turned aside out of the road, he was overtaken bynight in a thicket of oak or cork trees; for on this point Cide Hamete isnot as precise as he usually is on other matters.</p><p>Master and man dismounted from their beasts, and as soon as they hadsettled themselves at the foot of the trees, Sancho, who had had a goodnoontide meal that day, let himself, without more ado, pass the gates ofsleep. But Don Quixote, whom his thoughts, far more than hunger, keptawake, could not close an eye, and roamed in fancy to and fro through allsorts of places. At one moment it seemed to him that he was in the cave ofMontesinos and saw Dulcinea, transformed into a country wench, skippingand mounting upon her she-ass; again that the words of the sage Merlinwere sounding in his ears, setting forth the conditions to be observed andthe exertions to be made for the disenchantment of Dulcinea. He lost allpatience when he considered the laziness and want of charity of his squireSancho; for to the best of his belief he had only given himself fivelashes, a number paltry and disproportioned to the vast number required.At this thought he felt such vexation and anger that he reasoned thematter thus: &ldquo;If Alexander the Great cut the Gordian knot, saying,&lsquo;To cut comes to the same thing as to untie,&rsquo; and yet did notfail to become lord paramount of all Asia, neither more nor less couldhappen now in Dulcinea&rsquo;s disenchantment if I scourge Sancho againsthis will; for, if it is the condition of the remedy that Sancho shallreceive three thousand and odd lashes, what does it matter to me whetherhe inflicts them himself, or someone else inflicts them, when theessential point is that he receives them, let them come from whateverquarter they may?&rdquo;</p><p>With this idea he went over to Sancho, having first taken Rocinante&rsquo;sreins and arranged them so as to be able to flog him with them, and beganto untie the points (the common belief is he had but one in front) bywhich his breeches were held up; but the instant he approached him Sanchowoke up in his full senses and cried out, &ldquo;What is this? Who istouching me and untrussing me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and I come to make goodthy shortcomings and relieve my own distresses; I come to whip thee,Sancho, and wipe off some portion of the debt thou hast undertaken.Dulcinea is perishing, thou art living on regardless, I am dying of hopedeferred; therefore untruss thyself with a good will, for mine it is,here, in this retired spot, to give thee at least two thousand lashes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;let your worship keepquiet, or else by the living God the deaf shall hear us; the lashes Ipledged myself to must be voluntary and not forced upon me, and just now Ihave no fancy to whip myself; it is enough if I give you my word to flogand flap myself when I have a mind.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will not do to leave it to thy courtesy, Sancho,&rdquo; said DonQuixote, &ldquo;for thou art hard of heart and, though a clown, tender offlesh;&rdquo; and at the same time he strove and struggled to untie him.</p><p>Seeing this Sancho got up, and grappling with his master he gripped himwith all his might in his arms, giving him a trip with the heel stretchedhim on the ground on his back, and pressing his right knee on his chestheld his hands in his own so that he could neither move nor breathe.</p><p>&ldquo;How now, traitor!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Quixote. &ldquo;Dost thourevolt against thy master and natural lord? Dost thou rise against him whogives thee his bread?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I neither put down king, nor set up king,&rdquo; said Sancho;&ldquo;I only stand up for myself who am my own lord; if your worshippromises me to be quiet, and not to offer to whip me now, I&rsquo;ll letyou go free and unhindered; if not&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Traitor and Doña Sancha&rsquo;s foe,<br/>Thou diest on the spot.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote gave his promise, and swore by the life of his thoughts not totouch so much as a hair of his garments, and to leave him entirely freeand to his own discretion to whip himself whenever he pleased.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p60c" id="p60c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p60c.jpg (250K)" src="images/p60c.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p60c.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot, but as he was aboutto place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch hishead, and putting up his hands encountered somebody&rsquo;s two feet withshoes and stockings on them. He trembled with fear and made for anothertree, where the very same thing happened to him, and he fell a-shouting,calling upon Don Quixote to come and protect him. Don Quixote did so, andasked him what had happened to him, and what he was afraid of. Sanchoreplied that all the trees were full of men&rsquo;s feet and legs. DonQuixote felt them, and guessed at once what it was, and said to Sancho,&ldquo;Thou hast nothing to be afraid of, for these feet and legs thatthou feelest but canst not see belong no doubt to some outlaws andfreebooters that have been hanged on these trees; for the authorities inthese parts are wont to hang them up by twenties and thirties when theycatch them; whereby I conjecture that I must be near Barcelona;&rdquo; andit was, in fact, as he supposed; with the first light they looked up andsaw that the fruit hanging on those trees were freebooters&rsquo; bodies.</p><p>And now day dawned; and if the dead freebooters had scared them, theirhearts were no less troubled by upwards of forty living ones, who all of asudden surrounded them, and in the Catalan tongue bade them stand and waituntil their captain came up. Don Quixote was on foot with his horseunbridled and his lance leaning against a tree, and in short completelydefenceless; he thought it best therefore to fold his arms and bow hishead and reserve himself for a more favourable occasion and opportunity.The robbers made haste to search Dapple, and did not leave him a singlething of all he carried in the alforjas and in the valise; and lucky itwas for Sancho that the duke&rsquo;s crowns and those he brought from homewere in a girdle that he wore round him; but for all that these good folkwould have stripped him, and even looked to see what he had hidden betweenthe skin and flesh, but for the arrival at that moment of their captain,who was about thirty-four years of age apparently, strongly built, abovethe middle height, of stern aspect and swarthy complexion. He was mountedupon a powerful horse, and had on a coat of mail, with four of the pistolsthey call petronels in that country at his waist. He saw that his squires(for so they call those who follow that trade) were about to rifle SanchoPanza, but he ordered them to desist and was at once obeyed, so the girdleescaped. He wondered to see the lance leaning against the tree, the shieldon the ground, and Don Quixote in armour and dejected, with the saddestand most melancholy face that sadness itself could produce; and going upto him he said, &ldquo;Be not so cast down, good man, for you have notfallen into the hands of any inhuman Busiris, but into Roque Guinart&rsquo;s,which are more merciful than cruel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The cause of my dejection,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;isnot that I have fallen into thy hands, O valiant Roque, whose fame isbounded by no limits on earth, but that my carelessness should have beenso great that thy soldiers should have caught me unbridled, when it is myduty, according to the rule of knight-errantry which I profess, to bealways on the alert and at all times my own sentinel; for let me tellthee, great Roque, had they found me on my horse, with my lance andshield, it would not have been very easy for them to reduce me tosubmission, for I am Don Quixote of La Mancha, he who hath filled thewhole world with his achievements.&rdquo;</p><p>Roque Guinart at once perceived that Don Quixote&rsquo;s weakness was moreakin to madness than to swagger; and though he had sometimes heard himspoken of, he never regarded the things attributed to him as true, norcould he persuade himself that such a humour could become dominant in theheart of man; he was extremely glad, therefore, to meet him and test atclose quarters what he had heard of him at a distance; so he said to him,&ldquo;Despair not, valiant knight, nor regard as an untoward fate theposition in which thou findest thyself; it may be that by these slips thycrooked fortune will make itself straight; for heaven by strangecircuitous ways, mysterious and incomprehensible to man, raises up thefallen and makes rich the poor.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote was about to thank him, when they heard behind them a noise asof a troop of horses; there was, however, but one, riding on which at afurious pace came a youth, apparently about twenty years of age, clad ingreen damask edged with gold and breeches and a loose frock, with a hatlooped up in the Walloon fashion, tight-fitting polished boots, giltspurs, dagger and sword, and in his hand a musketoon, and a pair ofpistols at his waist.</p><p>Roque turned round at the noise and perceived this comely figure, whichdrawing near thus addressed him, &ldquo;I came in quest of thee, valiantRoque, to find in thee if not a remedy at least relief in my misfortune;and not to keep thee in suspense, for I see thou dost not recognise me, Iwill tell thee who I am; I am Claudia Jeronima, the daughter of SimonForte, thy good friend, and special enemy of Clauquel Torrellas, who isthine also as being of the faction opposed to thee. Thou knowest that thisTorrellas has a son who is called, or at least was not two hours since,Don Vicente Torrellas. Well, to cut short the tale of my misfortune, Iwill tell thee in a few words what this youth has brought upon me. He sawme, he paid court to me, I listened to him, and, unknown to my father, Iloved him; for there is no woman, however secluded she may live or closeshe may be kept, who will not have opportunities and to spare forfollowing her headlong impulses. In a word, he pledged himself to be mine,and I promised to be his, without carrying matters any further. YesterdayI learned that, forgetful of his pledge to me, he was about to marryanother, and that he was to go this morning to plight his troth,intelligence which overwhelmed and exasperated me; my father not being athome I was able to adopt this costume you see, and urging my horse tospeed I overtook Don Vicente about a league from this, and without waitingto utter reproaches or hear excuses I fired this musket at him, and thesetwo pistols besides, and to the best of my belief I must have lodged morethan two bullets in his body, opening doors to let my honour go free,enveloped in his blood. I left him there in the hands of his servants, whodid not dare and were not able to interfere in his defence, and I come toseek from thee a safe-conduct into France, where I have relatives withwhom I can live; and also to implore thee to protect my father, so thatDon Vicente&rsquo;s numerous kinsmen may not venture to wreak theirlawless vengeance upon him.&rdquo;</p><p>Roque, filled with admiration at the gallant bearing, high spirit, comelyfigure, and adventure of the fair Claudia, said to her, &ldquo;Come,señora, let us go and see if thy enemy is dead; and then we will considerwhat will be best for thee.&rdquo; Don Quixote, who had been listening towhat Claudia said and Roque Guinart said in reply to her, exclaimed,&ldquo;Nobody need trouble himself with the defence of this lady, for Itake it upon myself. Give me my horse and arms, and wait for me here; Iwill go in quest of this knight, and dead or alive I will make him keephis word plighted to so great beauty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody need have any doubt about that,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;formy master has a very happy knack of matchmaking; it&rsquo;s not many dayssince he forced another man to marry, who in the same way backed out ofhis promise to another maiden; and if it had not been for his persecutorsthe enchanters changing the man&rsquo;s proper shape into a lacquey&rsquo;sthe said maiden would not be one this minute.&rdquo;</p><p>Roque, who was paying more attention to the fair Claudia&rsquo;s adventurethan to the words of master or man, did not hear them; and ordering hissquires to restore to Sancho everything they had stripped Dapple of, hedirected them to return to the place where they had been quartered duringthe night, and then set off with Claudia at full speed in search of thewounded or slain Don Vicente. They reached the spot where Claudia met him,but found nothing there save freshly spilt blood; looking all round,however, they descried some people on the slope of a hill above them, andconcluded, as indeed it proved to be, that it was Don Vicente, whom eitherdead or alive his servants were removing to attend to his wounds or tobury him. They made haste to overtake them, which, as the party movedslowly, they were able to do with ease. They found Don Vicente in the armsof his servants, whom he was entreating in a broken feeble voice to leavehim there to die, as the pain of his wounds would not suffer him to go anyfarther. Claudia and Roque threw themselves off their horses and advancedtowards him; the servants were overawed by the appearance of Roque, andClaudia was moved by the sight of Don Vicente, and going up to him halftenderly half sternly, she seized his hand and said to him, &ldquo;Hadstthou given me this according to our compact thou hadst never come to thispass.&rdquo;</p><p>The wounded gentleman opened his all but closed eyes, and recognisingClaudia said, &ldquo;I see clearly, fair and mistaken lady, that it isthou that hast slain me, a punishment not merited or deserved by myfeelings towards thee, for never did I mean to, nor could I, wrong thee inthought or deed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is not true, then,&rdquo; said Claudia, &ldquo;that thou wertgoing this morning to marry Leonora the daughter of the rich Balvastro?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Assuredly not,&rdquo; replied Don Vicente; &ldquo;my cruel fortunemust have carried those tidings to thee to drive thee in thy jealousy totake my life; and to assure thyself of this, press my hands and take mefor thy husband if thou wilt; I have no better satisfaction to offer theefor the wrong thou fanciest thou hast received from me.&rdquo;</p><p>Claudia wrung his hands, and her own heart was so wrung that she layfainting on the bleeding breast of Don Vicente, whom a death spasm seizedthe same instant. Roque was in perplexity and knew not what to do; theservants ran to fetch water to sprinkle their faces, and brought some andbathed them with it. Claudia recovered from her fainting fit, but not soDon Vicente from the paroxysm that had overtaken him, for his life hadcome to an end. On perceiving this, Claudia, when she had convincedherself that her beloved husband was no more, rent the air with her sighsand made the heavens ring with her lamentations; she tore her hair andscattered it to the winds, she beat her face with her hands and showed allthe signs of grief and sorrow that could be conceived to come from anafflicted heart. &ldquo;Cruel, reckless woman!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;howeasily wert thou moved to carry out a thought so wicked! O furious forceof jealousy, to what desperate lengths dost thou lead those that give theelodging in their bosoms! O husband, whose unhappy fate in being mine hathborne thee from the marriage bed to the grave!&rdquo;</p><p>So vehement and so piteous were the lamentations of Claudia that they drewtears from Roque&rsquo;s eyes, unused as they were to shed them on anyoccasion. The servants wept, Claudia swooned away again and again, and thewhole place seemed a field of sorrow and an abode of misfortune. In theend Roque Guinart directed Don Vicente&rsquo;s servants to carry his bodyto his father&rsquo;s village, which was close by, for burial. Claudiatold him she meant to go to a monastery of which an aunt of hers wasabbess, where she intended to pass her life with a better and everlastingspouse. He applauded her pious resolution, and offered to accompany herwhithersoever she wished, and to protect her father against the kinsmen ofDon Vicente and all the world, should they seek to injure him. Claudiawould not on any account allow him to accompany her; and thanking him forhis offers as well as she could, took leave of him in tears. The servantsof Don Vicente carried away his body, and Roque returned to his comrades,and so ended the love of Claudia Jeronima; but what wonder, when it wasthe insuperable and cruel might of jealousy that wove the web of her sadstory?</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p60d" id="p60d"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p60d.jpg (439K)" src="images/p60d.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p60d.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Roque Guinart found his squires at the place to which he had ordered them,and Don Quixote on Rocinante in the midst of them delivering a harangue tothem in which he urged them to give up a mode of life so full of peril, aswell to the soul as to the body; but as most of them were Gascons, roughlawless fellows, his speech did not make much impression on them. Roque oncoming up asked Sancho if his men had returned and restored to him thetreasures and jewels they had stripped off Dapple. Sancho said they had,but that three kerchiefs that were worth three cities were missing.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, man?&rdquo; said one of the bystanders;&ldquo;I have got them, and they are not worth three reals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but my squire valuesthem at the rate he says, as having been given me by the person who gavethem.&rdquo;</p><p>Roque Guinart ordered them to be restored at once; and making his men fallin in line he directed all the clothing, jewellery, and money that theyhad taken since the last distribution to be produced; and making a hastyvaluation, and reducing what could not be divided into money, he madeshares for the whole band so equitably and carefully, that in no case didhe exceed or fall short of strict distributive justice.</p><p>When this had been done, and all left satisfied, Roque observed to DonQuixote, &ldquo;If this scrupulous exactness were not observed with thesefellows there would be no living with them.&rdquo;</p><p>Upon this Sancho remarked, &ldquo;From what I have seen here, justice issuch a good thing that there is no doing without it, even among thethieves themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>One of the squires heard this, and raising the butt-end of his harquebusswould no doubt have broken Sancho&rsquo;s head with it had not RoqueGuinart called out to him to hold his hand.

Whatled me into it was a certain thirst for vengeance, which is strong enoughto disturb the quietest hearts. I am by nature tender-hearted and kindly,but, as I said, the desire to revenge myself for a wrong that was done meso overturns all my better impulses that I keep on in this way of life inspite of what conscience tells me; and as one depth calls to another, andone sin to another sin, revenges have linked themselves together, and Ihave taken upon myself not only my own but those of others: it pleasesGod, however, that, though I see myself in this maze of entanglements, Ido not lose all hope of escaping from it and reaching a safe port.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote was amazed to hear Roque utter such excellent and justsentiments, for he did not think that among those who followed such tradesas robbing, murdering, and waylaying, there could be anyone capable of avirtuous thought, and he said in reply, &ldquo;Señor Roque, the beginningof health lies in knowing the disease and in the sick man&rsquo;swillingness to take the medicines which the physician prescribes; you aresick, you know what ails you, and heaven, or more properly speaking God,who is our physician, will administer medicines that will cure you, andcure gradually, and not of a sudden or by a miracle; besides, sinners ofdiscernment are nearer amendment than those who are fools; and as yourworship has shown good sense in your remarks, all you have to do is tokeep up a good heart and trust that the weakness of your conscience willbe strengthened. And if you have any desire to shorten the journey and putyourself easily in the way of salvation, come with me, and I will show youhow to become a knight-errant, a calling wherein so many hardships andmishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances they will lodgeyou in heaven in a trice.&rdquo;</p><p>Roque laughed at Don Quixote&rsquo;s exhortation, and changing theconversation he related the tragic affair of Claudia Jeronima, at whichSancho was extremely grieved; for he had not found the young woman&rsquo;sbeauty, boldness, and spirit at all amiss.</p><p>And now the squires despatched to make the prize came up, bringing withthem two gentlemen on horseback, two pilgrims on foot, and a coach full ofwomen with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance onthem, and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them. Thesquires made a ring round them, both victors and vanquished maintainingprofound silence, waiting for the great Roque Guinart to speak. He askedthe gentlemen who they were, whither they were going, and what money theycarried with them; &ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; replied one of them, &ldquo;we aretwo captains of Spanish infantry; our companies are at Naples, and we areon our way to embark in four galleys which they say are at Barcelona underorders for Sicily; and we have about two or three hundred crowns, withwhich we are, according to our notions, rich and contented, for a soldier&rsquo;spoverty does not allow a more extensive hoard.&rdquo;</p><p>Roque asked the pilgrims the same questions he had put to the captains,and was answered that they were going to take ship for Rome, and thatbetween them they might have about sixty reals. He asked also who was inthe coach, whither they were bound and what money they had, and one of themen on horseback replied, &ldquo;The persons in the coach are my lady DoñaGuiomar de Quiñones, wife of the regent of the Vicaria at Naples, herlittle daughter, a handmaid and a duenna; we six servants are inattendance upon her, and the money amounts to six hundred crowns.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So then,&rdquo; said Roque Guinart, &ldquo;we have got here ninehundred crowns and sixty reals; my soldiers must number some sixty; seehow much there falls to each, for I am a bad arithmetician.&rdquo; As soonas the robbers heard this they raised a shout of &ldquo;Long life to RoqueGuinart, in spite of the lladres that seek his ruin!&rdquo;</p><p>The captains showed plainly the concern they felt, the regent&rsquo;s ladywas downcast, and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their propertyconfiscated. Roque kept them in suspense in this way for a while; but hehad no desire to prolong their distress, which might be seen a bowshotoff, and turning to the captains he said, &ldquo;Sirs, will your worshipsbe pleased of your courtesy to lend me sixty crowns, and her ladyship theregent&rsquo;s wife eighty, to satisfy this band that follows me, for&lsquo;it is by his singing the abbot gets his dinner;&rsquo; and then youmay at once proceed on your journey, free and unhindered, with asafe-conduct which I shall give you, so that if you come across any otherbands of mine that I have scattered in these parts, they may do you noharm; for I have no intention of doing injury to soldiers, or to anywoman, especially one of quality.&rdquo;</p><p>Profuse and hearty were the expressions of gratitude with which thecaptains thanked Roque for his courtesy and generosity; for such theyregarded his leaving them their own money. Señora Doña Guiomar de Quiñoneswanted to throw herself out of the coach to kiss the feet and hands of thegreat Roque, but he would not suffer it on any account; so far from that,he begged her pardon for the wrong he had done her under pressure of theinexorable necessities of his unfortunate calling. The regent&rsquo;s ladyordered one of her servants to give the eighty crowns that had beenassessed as her share at once, for the captains had already paid downtheir sixty. The pilgrims were about to give up the whole of their littlehoard, but Roque bade them keep quiet, and turning to his men he said,&ldquo;Of these crowns two fall to each man and twenty remain over; letten be given to these pilgrims, and the other ten to this worthy squirethat he may be able to speak favourably of this adventure;&rdquo; and thenhaving writing materials, with which he always went provided, brought tohim, he gave them in writing a safe-conduct to the leaders of his bands;and bidding them farewell let them go free and filled with admiration athis magnanimity, his generous disposition, and his unusual conduct, andinclined to regard him as an Alexander the Great rather than a notoriousrobber.</p><p>One of the squires observed in his mixture of Gascon and Catalan, &ldquo;Thiscaptain of ours would make a better friar than highwayman; if he wants tobe so generous another time, let it be with his own property and not ours.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p60f" id="p60f"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p60f.jpg (426K)" src="images/p60f.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p60f.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The unlucky wight did not speak so low but that Roque overheard him, anddrawing his sword almost split his head in two, saying, &ldquo;That is theway I punish impudent saucy fellows.&rdquo; They were all taken aback, andnot one of them dared to utter a word, such deference did they pay him.Roque then withdrew to one side and wrote a letter to a friend of his atBarcelona, telling him that the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, theknight-errant of whom there was so much talk, was with him, and was, heassured him, the drollest and wisest man in the world; and that in fourdays from that date, that is to say, on Saint John the Baptist&rsquo;sDay, he was going to deposit him in full armour mounted on his horseRocinante, together with his squire Sancho on an ass, in the middle of thestrand of the city; and bidding him give notice of this to his friends theNiarros, that they might divert themselves with him. He wished, he said,his enemies the Cadells could be deprived of this pleasure; but that wasimpossible, because the crazes and shrewd sayings of Don Quixote and thehumours of his squire Sancho Panza could not help giving general pleasureto all the world. He despatched the letter by one of his squires, who,exchanging the costume of a highwayman for that of a peasant, made his wayinto Barcelona and gave it to the person to whom it was directed.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p60g" id="p60g"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p60g.jpg (42K)" src="images/p60g.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch61b" id="ch61b"></a>CHAPTER LXI.<br/>OF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE ON ENTERING BARCELONA, TOGETHER WITH OTHERMATTERS THAT PARTAKE OF THE TRUE RATHER THAN OF THE INGENIOUS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p61a" id="p61a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p61a.jpg (143K)" src="images/p61a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p61a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote passed three days and three nights with Roque, and had hepassed three hundred years he would have found enough to observe andwonder at in his mode of life. At daybreak they were in one spot, atdinner-time in another; sometimes they fled without knowing from whom, atother times they lay in wait, not knowing for what. They slept standing,breaking their slumbers to shift from place to place. There was nothingbut sending out spies and scouts, posting sentinels and blowing thematches of harquebusses, though they carried but few, for almost all usedflintlocks. Roque passed his nights in some place or other apart from hismen, that they might not know where he was, for the many proclamations theviceroy of Barcelona had issued against his life kept him in fear anduneasiness, and he did not venture to trust anyone, afraid that even hisown men would kill him or deliver him up to the authorities; of a truth, aweary miserable life! At length, by unfrequented roads, short cuts, andsecret paths, Roque, Don Quixote, and Sancho, together with six squires,set out for Barcelona. They reached the strand on Saint John&rsquo;s Eveduring the night; and Roque, after embracing Don Quixote and Sancho (towhom he presented the ten crowns he had promised but had not until thengiven), left them with many expressions of good-will on both sides.</p><p>Roque went back, while Don Quixote remained on horseback, just as he was,waiting for day, and it was not long before the countenance of the fairAurora began to show itself at the balconies of the east, gladdening thegrass and flowers, if not the ear, though to gladden that too there cameat the same moment a sound of clarions and drums, and a din of bells, anda tramp, tramp, and cries of &ldquo;Clear the way there!&rdquo; of somerunners, that seemed to issue from the city.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p61b" id="p61b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p61b.jpg (271K)" src="images/p61b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p61b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The dawn made way for the sun that with a face broader than a bucklerbegan to rise slowly above the low line of the horizon; Don Quixote andSancho gazed all round them; they beheld the sea, a sight until thenunseen by them; it struck them as exceedingly spacious and broad, muchmore so than the lakes of Ruidera which they had seen in La Mancha. Theysaw the galleys along the beach, which, lowering their awnings, displayedthemselves decked with streamers and pennons that trembled in the breezeand kissed and swept the water, while on board the bugles, trumpets, andclarions were sounding and filling the air far and near with melodiouswarlike notes. Then they began to move and execute a kind of skirmish uponthe calm water, while a vast number of horsemen on fine horses and inshowy liveries, issuing from the city, engaged on their side in a somewhatsimilar movement. The soldiers on board the galleys kept up a ceaselessfire, which they on the walls and forts of the city returned, and theheavy cannon rent the air with the tremendous noise they made, to whichthe gangway guns of the galleys replied. The bright sea, the smilingearth, the clear air&mdash;though at times darkened by the smoke of theguns&mdash;all seemed to fill the whole multitude with unexpected delight.Sancho could not make out how it was that those great masses that movedover the sea had so many feet.</p><p>And now the horsemen in livery came galloping up with shouts andoutlandish cries and cheers to where Don Quixote stood amazed andwondering; and one of them, he to whom Roque had sent word, addressing himexclaimed, &ldquo;Welcome to our city, mirror, beacon, star and cynosureof all knight-errantry in its widest extent! Welcome, I say, valiant DonQuixote of La Mancha; not the false, the fictitious, the apocryphal, thatthese latter days have offered us in lying histories, but the true, thelegitimate, the real one that Cide Hamete Benengeli, flower of historians,has described to us!&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote made no answer, nor did the horsemen wait for one, butwheeling again with all their followers, they began curvetting round DonQuixote, who, turning to Sancho, said, &ldquo;These gentlemen have plainlyrecognised us; I will wager they have read our history, and even thatnewly printed one by the Aragonese.&rdquo;</p><p>The cavalier who had addressed Don Quixote again approached him and said,&ldquo;Come with us, Señor Don Quixote, for we are all of us your servantsand great friends of Roque Guinart&rsquo;s;&rdquo; to which Don Quixotereturned, &ldquo;If courtesy breeds courtesy, yours, sir knight, isdaughter or very nearly akin to the great Roque&rsquo;s; carry me whereyou please; I will have no will but yours, especially if you deign toemploy it in your service.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p61c" id="p61c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p61c.jpg (448K)" src="images/p61c.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p61c.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The cavalier replied with words no less polite, and then, all closing inaround him, they set out with him for the city, to the music of theclarions and the drums. As they were entering it, the wicked one, who isthe author of all mischief, and the boys who are wickeder than the wickedone, contrived that a couple of these audacious irrepressible urchinsshould force their way through the crowd, and lifting up, one of themDapple&rsquo;s tail and the other Rocinante&rsquo;s, insert a bunch offurze under each. The poor beasts felt the strange spurs and added totheir anguish by pressing their tails tight, so much so that, cutting amultitude of capers, they flung their masters to the ground. Don Quixote,covered with shame and out of countenance, ran to pluck the plume from hispoor jade&rsquo;s tail, while Sancho did the same for Dapple. Hisconductors tried to punish the audacity of the boys, but there was nopossibility of doing so, for they hid themselves among the hundreds ofothers that were following them. Don Quixote and Sancho mounted once more,and with the same music and acclamations reached their conductor&rsquo;shouse, which was large and stately, that of a rich gentleman, in short;and there for the present we will leave them, for such is Cide Hamete&rsquo;spleasure.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p61e" id="p61e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p61e.jpg (32K)" src="images/p61e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch62b" id="ch62b"></a>CHAPTER LXII.<br/>WHICH DEALS WITH THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENCHANTED HEAD, TOGETHER WITH OTHERTRIVIAL MATTERS WHICH CANNOT BE LEFT UNTOLD</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p62a" id="p62a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p62a.jpg (156K)" src="images/p62a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p62a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Quixote&rsquo;s host was one Don Antonio Moreno by name, a gentlemanof wealth and intelligence, and very fond of diverting himself in any fairand good-natured way; and having Don Quixote in his house he set aboutdevising modes of making him exhibit his mad points in some harmlessfashion; for jests that give pain are no jests, and no sport is worthanything if it hurts another. The first thing he did was to make DonQuixote take off his armour, and lead him, in that tight chamois suit wehave already described and depicted more than once, out on a balconyoverhanging one of the chief streets of the city, in full view of thecrowd and of the boys, who gazed at him as they would at a monkey. Thecavaliers in livery careered before him again as though it were for himalone, and not to enliven the festival of the day, that they wore it, andSancho was in high delight, for it seemed to him that, how he knew not, hehad fallen upon another Camacho&rsquo;s wedding, another house like DonDiego de Miranda&rsquo;s, another castle like the duke&rsquo;s. Some ofDon Antonio&rsquo;s friends dined with him that day, and all showed honourto Don Quixote and treated him as a knight-errant, and he becoming puffedup and exalted in consequence could not contain himself for satisfaction.Such were the drolleries of Sancho that all the servants of the house, andall who heard him, were kept hanging upon his lips. While at table DonAntonio said to him, &ldquo;We hear, worthy Sancho, that you are so fondof manjar blanco and forced-meat balls, that if you have any left, youkeep them in your bosom for the next day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, señor, that&rsquo;s not true,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for Iam more cleanly than greedy, and my master Don Quixote here knows wellthat we two are used to live for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts. Tobe sure, if it so happens that they offer me a heifer, I run with ahalter; I mean, I eat what I&rsquo;m given, and make use of opportunitiesas I find them; but whoever says that I&rsquo;m an out-of-the-way eater ornot cleanly, let me tell him that he is wrong; and I&rsquo;d put it in adifferent way if I did not respect the honourable beards that are at thetable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;Sancho&rsquo;s moderationand cleanliness in eating might be inscribed and graved on plates ofbrass, to be kept in eternal remembrance in ages to come. It is true thatwhen he is hungry there is a certain appearance of voracity about him, forhe eats at a great pace and chews with both jaws; but cleanliness he isalways mindful of; and when he was governor he learned how to eatdaintily, so much so that he eats grapes, and even pomegranate pips, witha fork.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Don Antonio, &ldquo;has Sancho been a governor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;and of an island called Barataria. Igoverned it to perfection for ten days; and lost my rest all the time; andlearned to look down upon all the governments in the world; I got out ofit by taking to flight, and fell into a pit where I gave myself up fordead, and out of which I escaped alive by a miracle.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote then gave them a minute account of the whole affair of Sancho&rsquo;sgovernment, with which he greatly amused his hearers.</p><p>On the cloth being removed Don Antonio, taking Don Quixote by the hand,passed with him into a distant room in which there was nothing in the wayof furniture except a table, apparently of jasper, resting on a pedestalof the same, upon which was set up, after the fashion of the busts of theRoman emperors, a head which seemed to be of bronze. Don Antonio traversedthe whole apartment with Don Quixote and walked round the table severaltimes, and then said, &ldquo;Now, Señor Don Quixote, that I am satisfiedthat no one is listening to us, and that the door is shut, I will tell youof one of the rarest adventures, or more properly speaking strange things,that can be imagined, on condition that you will keep what I say to you inthe remotest recesses of secrecy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I swear it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;and for greatersecurity I will put a flag-stone over it; for I would have you know, SeñorDon Antonio&rdquo; (he had by this time learned his name), &ldquo;that youare addressing one who, though he has ears to hear, has no tongue tospeak; so that you may safely transfer whatever you have in your bosominto mine, and rely upon it that you have consigned it to the depths ofsilence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In reliance upon that promise,&rdquo; said Don Antonio, &ldquo;Iwill astonish you with what you shall see and hear, and relieve myself ofsome of the vexation it gives me to have no one to whom I can confide mysecrets, for they are not of a sort to be entrusted to everybody.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote was puzzled, wondering what could be the object of suchprecautions; whereupon Don Antonio taking his hand passed it over thebronze head and the whole table and the pedestal of jasper on which itstood, and then said, &ldquo;This head, Señor Don Quixote, has been madeand fabricated by one of the greatest magicians and wizards the world eversaw, a Pole, I believe, by birth, and a pupil of the famous Escotillo ofwhom such marvellous stories are told. He was here in my house, and for aconsideration of a thousand crowns that I gave him he constructed thishead, which has the property and virtue of answering whatever questionsare put to its ear. He observed the points of the compass, he tracedfigures, he studied the stars, he watched favourable moments, and atlength brought it to the perfection we shall see to-morrow, for on Fridaysit is mute, and this being Friday we must wait till the next day. In theinterval your worship may consider what you would like to ask it; and Iknow by experience that in all its answers it tells the truth.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote was amazed at the virtue and property of the head, and wasinclined to disbelieve Don Antonio; but seeing what a short time he had towait to test the matter, he did not choose to say anything except that hethanked him for having revealed to him so mighty a secret. They thenquitted the room, Don Antonio locked the door, and they repaired to thechamber where the rest of the gentlemen were assembled. In the meantimeSancho had recounted to them several of the adventures and accidents thathad happened his master.</p><p>That afternoon they took Don Quixote out for a stroll, not in his armourbut in street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him, that atthat season would have made ice itself sweat. Orders were left with theservants to entertain Sancho so as not to let him leave the house. DonQuixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall mule of easy paceand handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on him, and on the back,without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment on which they wrotein large letters, &ldquo;This is Don Quixote of La Mancha.&rdquo; As theyset out upon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of all whochanced to see him, and as they read out, &ldquo;This is Don Quixote of LaMancha,&rdquo; Don Quixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at him,called him by his name, and recognised him, and turning to Don Antonio,who rode at his side, he observed to him, &ldquo;Great are the privilegesknight-errantry involves, for it makes him who professes it known andfamous in every region of the earth; see, Don Antonio, even the very boysof this city know me without ever having seen me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;True, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo; returned Don Antonio; &ldquo;for asfire cannot be hidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape beingrecognised; and that which is attained by the profession of arms shinesdistinguished above all others.&rdquo;</p><p>It came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was proceeding amid theacclamations that have been described, a Castilian, reading theinscription on his back, cried out in a loud voice, &ldquo;The devil takethee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha! What! art thou here, and not dead ofthe countless drubbings that have fallen on thy ribs? Thou art mad; and ifthou wert so by thyself, and kept thyself within thy madness, it would notbe so bad; but thou hast the gift of making fools and blockheads of allwho have anything to do with thee or say to thee. Why, look at thesegentlemen bearing thee company! Get thee home, blockhead, and see afterthy affairs, and thy wife and children, and give over these fooleries thatare sapping thy brains and skimming away thy wits.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go your own way, brother,&rdquo; said Don Antonio, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;toffer advice to those who don&rsquo;t ask you for it. Señor Don Quixote isin his full senses, and we who bear him company are not fools; virtue isto be honoured wherever it may be found; go, and bad luck to you, and don&rsquo;tmeddle where you are not wanted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God, your worship is right,&rdquo; replied the Castilian;&ldquo;for to advise this good man is to kick against the pricks; stillfor all that it fills me with pity that the sound wit they say theblockhead has in everything should dribble away by the channel of hisknight-errantry; but may the bad luck your worship talks of follow me andall my descendants, if, from this day forth, though I should live longerthan Methuselah, I ever give advice to anybody even if he asks me for it.&rdquo;</p><p>The advice-giver took himself off, and they continued their stroll; but sogreat was the press of the boys and people to read the placard, that DonAntonio was forced to remove it as if he were taking off something else.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p62b" id="p62b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p62b.jpg (373K)" src="images/p62b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p62b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Night came and they went home, and there was a ladies&rsquo; dancingparty, for Don Antonio&rsquo;s wife, a lady of rank and gaiety, beauty andwit, had invited some friends of hers to come and do honour to her guestand amuse themselves with his strange delusions. Several of them came,they supped sumptuously, the dance began at about ten o&rsquo;clock. Amongthe ladies were two of a mischievous and frolicsome turn, and, thoughperfectly modest, somewhat free in playing tricks for harmless diversion&rsquo;ssake. These two were so indefatigable in taking Don Quixote out to dancethat they tired him down, not only in body but in spirit. It was a sightto see the figure Don Quixote made, long, lank, lean, and yellow, hisgarments clinging tight to him, ungainly, and above all anything butagile.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p62c" id="p62c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p62c.jpg (342K)" src="images/p62c.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p62c.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The gay ladies made secret love to him, and he on his part secretly repelledthem, but finding himself hard pressed by their blandishments he lifted up hisvoice and exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>Fugite, partes adversæ!</i> Leave me in peace,unwelcome overtures; avaunt, with your desires, ladies, for she who is queen ofmine, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, suffers none but hers to lead mecaptive and subdue me;&rdquo; and so saying he sat down on the floor in themiddle of the room, tired out and broken down by all this exertion in the dance.</p><p>Don Antonio directed him to be taken up bodily and carried to bed, and thefirst that laid hold of him was Sancho, saying as he did so, &ldquo;In anevil hour you took to dancing, master mine; do you fancy all mighty men ofvalour are dancers, and all knights-errant given to capering? If you do, Ican tell you you are mistaken; there&rsquo;s many a man would ratherundertake to kill a giant than cut a caper. If it had been the shoe-flingyou were at I could take your place, for I can do the shoe-fling like agerfalcon; but I&rsquo;m no good at dancing.&rdquo;</p><p>With these and other observations Sancho set the whole ball-room laughing,and then put his master to bed, covering him up well so that he mightsweat out any chill caught after his dancing.</p><p>The next day Don Antonio thought he might as well make trial of theenchanted head, and with Don Quixote, Sancho, and two others, friends ofhis, besides the two ladies that had tired out Don Quixote at the ball,who had remained for the night with Don Antonio&rsquo;s wife, he lockedhimself up in the chamber where the head was. He explained to them theproperty it possessed and entrusted the secret to them, telling them thatnow for the first time he was going to try the virtue of the enchantedhead; but except Don Antonio&rsquo;s two friends no one else was privy tothe mystery of the enchantment, and if Don Antonio had not first revealedit to them they would have been inevitably reduced to the same state ofamazement as the rest, so artfully and skilfully was it contrived.</p><p>The first to approach the ear of the head was Don Antonio himself, and ina low voice but not so low as not to be audible to all, he said to it,&ldquo;Head, tell me by the virtue that lies in thee what am I at thismoment thinking of?&rdquo;</p><p>The head, without any movement of the lips, answered in a clear anddistinct voice, so as to be heard by all, &ldquo;I cannot judge ofthoughts.&rdquo;</p><p>All were thunderstruck at this, and all the more so as they saw that therewas nobody anywhere near the table or in the whole room that could haveanswered. &ldquo;How many of us are here?&rdquo; asked Don Antonio oncemore; and it was answered him in the same way softly, &ldquo;Thou and thywife, with two friends of thine and two of hers, and a famous knightcalled Don Quixote of La Mancha, and a squire of his, Sancho Panza byname.&rdquo;</p><p>Now there was fresh astonishment; now everyone&rsquo;s hair was standing on endwith awe; and Don Antonio retiring from the head exclaimed, &ldquo;Thissuffices to show me that I have not been deceived by him who sold thee to me, Osage head, talking head, answering head, wonderful head! Let someone else goand put what question he likes to it.&rdquo;</p><p>And as women are commonly impulsive and inquisitive, the first to comeforward was one of the two friends of Don Antonio&rsquo;s wife, and herquestion was, &ldquo;Tell me, Head, what shall I do to be very beautiful?&rdquo;and the answer she got was, &ldquo;Be very modest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I question thee no further,&rdquo; said the fair querist.</p><p>Her companion then came up and said, &ldquo;I should like to know, Head,whether my husband loves me or not;&rdquo; the answer given to her was,&ldquo;Think how he uses thee, and thou mayest guess;&rdquo; and themarried lady went off saying, &ldquo;That answer did not need a question;for of course the treatment one receives shows the disposition of him fromwhom it is received.&rdquo;</p><p>Then one of Don Antonio&rsquo;s two friends advanced and asked it, &ldquo;Whoam I?&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou knowest,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;That isnot what I ask thee,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;but to tell me ifthou knowest me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I know thee, thou art Don Pedro Noriz,&rdquo;was the reply.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not seek to know more,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;forthis is enough to convince me, O Head, that thou knowest everything;&rdquo;and as he retired the other friend came forward and asked it, &ldquo;Tellme, Head, what are the wishes of my eldest son?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have said already,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;that I cannotjudge of wishes; however, I can tell thee the wish of thy son is to burythee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &lsquo;what I see with my eyes I point out with myfinger,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;so I ask no more.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Antonio&rsquo;s wife came up and said, &ldquo;I know not what to askthee, Head; I would only seek to know of thee if I shall have many yearsof enjoyment of my good husband;&rdquo; and the answer she received was,&ldquo;Thou shalt, for his vigour and his temperate habits promise manyyears of life, which by their intemperance others so often cut short.&rdquo;</p><p>Then Don Quixote came forward and said, &ldquo;Tell me, thou thatanswerest, was that which I describe as having happened to me in the caveof Montesinos the truth or a dream? Will Sancho&rsquo;s whipping beaccomplished without fail? Will the disenchantment of Dulcinea be broughtabout?&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p62d" id="p62d"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p62d.jpg (391K)" src="images/p62d.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p62d.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;As to the question of the cave,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;thereis much to be said; there is something of both in it. Sancho&rsquo;swhipping will proceed leisurely. The disenchantment of Dulcinea willattain its due consummation.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I seek to know no more,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;let me butsee Dulcinea disenchanted, and I will consider that all the good fortune Icould wish for has come upon me all at once.&rdquo;</p><p>The last questioner was Sancho, and his questions were, &ldquo;Head, shallI by any chance have another government? Shall I ever escape from the hardlife of a squire? Shall I get back to see my wife and children?&rdquo; Towhich the answer came, &ldquo;Thou shalt govern in thy house; and if thoureturnest to it thou shalt see thy wife and children; and on ceasing toserve thou shalt cease to be a squire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, by God!&rdquo; said Sancho Panza; &ldquo;I could have toldmyself that; the prophet Perogrullo could have said no more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What answer wouldst thou have, beast?&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;is it not enough that the replies this head has given suit thequestions put to it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it is enough,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;but I should haveliked it to have made itself plainer and told me more.&rdquo;</p><p>The questions and answers came to an end here, but not the wonder withwhich all were filled, except Don Antonio&rsquo;s two friends who were inthe secret. This Cide Hamete Benengeli thought fit to reveal at once, notto keep the world in suspense, fancying that the head had some strangemagical mystery in it. He says, therefore, that on the model of anotherhead, the work of an image maker, which he had seen at Madrid, Don Antoniomade this one at home for his own amusement and to astonish ignorantpeople; and its mechanism was as follows. The table was of wood paintedand varnished to imitate jasper, and the pedestal on which it stood was ofthe same material, with four eagles&rsquo; claws projecting from it tosupport the weight more steadily. The head, which resembled a bust orfigure of a Roman emperor, and was coloured like bronze, was hollowthroughout, as was the table, into which it was fitted so exactly that notrace of the joining was visible. The pedestal of the table was alsohollow and communicated with the throat and neck of the head, and thewhole was in communication with another room underneath the chamber inwhich the head stood. Through the entire cavity in the pedestal, table,throat and neck of the bust or figure, there passed a tube of tincarefully adjusted and concealed from sight. In the room belowcorresponding to the one above was placed the person who was to answer,with his mouth to the tube, and the voice, as in an ear-trumpet, passedfrom above downwards, and from below upwards, the words coming clearly anddistinctly; it was impossible, thus, to detect the trick. A nephew of DonAntonio&rsquo;s, a smart sharp-witted student, was the answerer, and as hehad been told beforehand by his uncle who the persons were that would comewith him that day into the chamber where the head was, it was an easymatter for him to answer the first question at once and correctly; theothers he answered by guess-work, and, being clever, cleverly. Cide Hameteadds that this marvellous contrivance stood for some ten or twelve days;but that, as it became noised abroad through the city that he had in hishouse an enchanted head that answered all who asked questions of it, DonAntonio, fearing it might come to the ears of the watchful sentinels ofour faith, explained the matter to the inquisitors, who commanded him tobreak it up and have done with it, lest the ignorant vulgar should bescandalised. By Don Quixote, however, and by Sancho the head was stillheld to be an enchanted one, and capable of answering questions, thoughmore to Don Quixote&rsquo;s satisfaction than Sancho&rsquo;s.</p><p>The gentlemen of the city, to gratify Don Antonio and also to do thehonours to Don Quixote, and give him an opportunity of displaying hisfolly, made arrangements for a tilting at the ring in six days from thattime, which, however, for reason that will be mentioned hereafter, did nottake place.</p><p>Don Quixote took a fancy to stroll about the city quietly and on foot, forhe feared that if he went on horseback the boys would follow him; so heand Sancho and two servants that Don Antonio gave him set out for a walk.Thus it came to pass that going along one of the streets Don Quixotelifted up his eyes and saw written in very large letters over a door,&ldquo;Books printed here,&rdquo; at which he was vastly pleased, foruntil then he had never seen a printing office, and he was curious to knowwhat it was like. He entered with all his following, and saw them drawingsheets in one place, correcting in another, setting up type here, revisingthere; in short all the work that is to be seen in great printing offices.He went up to one case and asked what they were about there; the workmentold him, he watched them with wonder, and passed on. He approached oneman, among others, and asked him what he was doing. The workman replied,&ldquo;Señor, this gentleman here&rdquo; (pointing to a man ofprepossessing appearance and a certain gravity of look) &ldquo;hastranslated an Italian book into our Spanish tongue, and I am setting it upin type for the press.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is the title of the book?&rdquo; asked Don Quixote; to whichthe author replied, &ldquo;Señor, in Italian the book is called <i>LeBagatelle</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what does <i>Le Bagatelle</i> import in our Spanish?&rdquo; asked DonQuixote.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Le Bagatelle</i>,&rdquo; said the author, &ldquo;is as though we shouldsay in Spanish <i>Los Juguetes;</i> but though the book is humble in name it hasgood solid matter in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;have some little smattering ofItalian, and I plume myself on singing some of Ariosto&rsquo;s stanzas;but tell me, señor&mdash;I do not say this to test your ability, butmerely out of curiosity&mdash;have you ever met with the word <i>pignatta</i> inyour book?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, often,&rdquo; said the author.</p><p>&ldquo;And how do you render that in Spanish?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How should I render it,&rdquo; returned the author, &ldquo;but by<i>olla</i>?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Body o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; exclaimed Don Quixote, &ldquo;what a proficientyou are in the Italian language! I would lay a good wager that where they sayin Italian <i>piace</i> you say in Spanish <i>place</i>, and where they say<i>piu</i> you say <i>mas</i>, and you translate <i>sù</i> by <i>arriba</i> and<i>giù</i> by <i>abajo</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I translate them so of course,&rdquo; said the author, &ldquo;forthose are their proper equivalents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would venture to swear,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that yourworship is not known in the world, which always begrudges their reward torare wits and praiseworthy labours. What talents lie wasted there! Whatgenius thrust away into corners! What worth left neglected! Still it seemsto me that translation from one language into another, if it be not fromthe queens of languages, the Greek and the Latin, is like looking atFlemish tapestries on the wrong side; for though the figures are visible,they are full of threads that make them indistinct, and they do not showwith the smoothness and brightness of the right side; and translation fromeasy languages argues neither ingenuity nor command of words, any morethan transcribing or copying out one document from another. But I do notmean by this to draw the inference that no credit is to be allowed for thework of translating, for a man may employ himself in ways worse and lessprofitable to himself. This estimate does not include two famoustranslators, Doctor Cristóbal de Figueroa, in his <i>Pastor Fido</i>, and DonJuan de Jáuregui, in his <i>Aminta</i>, wherein by their felicity they leave itin doubt which is the translation and which the original. But tell me, areyou printing this book at your own risk, or have you sold the copyright tosome bookseller?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I print at my own risk,&rdquo; said the author, &ldquo;and I expectto make a thousand ducats at least by this first edition, which is to beof two thousand copies that will go off in a twinkling at six realsapiece.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A fine calculation you are making!&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;itis plain you don&rsquo;t know the ins and outs of the printers, and howthey play into one another&rsquo;s hands. I promise you when you findyourself saddled with two thousand copies you will feel so sore that itwill astonish you, particularly if the book is a little out of the commonand not in any way highly spiced.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the author, &ldquo;would your worship, then, haveme give it to a bookseller who will give three maravedis for the copyrightand think he is doing me a favour? I do not print my books to win fame inthe world, for I am known in it already by my works; I want to make money,without which reputation is not worth a rap.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God send your worship good luck,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; and hemoved on to another case, where he saw them correcting a sheet of a bookwith the title of &ldquo;Light of the Soul;&rdquo; noticing it heobserved, &ldquo;Books like this, though there are many of the kind, arethe ones that deserve to be printed, for many are the sinners in thesedays, and lights unnumbered are needed for all that are in darkness.&rdquo;</p><p>He passed on, and saw they were also correcting another book, and when heasked its title they told him it was called, &ldquo;The Second Part of theIngenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha,&rdquo; by one ofTordesillas.</p><p>&ldquo;I have heard of this book already,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;andverily and on my conscience I thought it had been by this time burned toashes as a meddlesome intruder; but its Martinmas will come to it as itdoes to every pig; for fictions have the more merit and charm about themthe more nearly they approach the truth or what looks like it; and truestories, the truer they are the better they are;&rdquo; and so saying hewalked out of the printing office with a certain amount of displeasure inhis looks. That same day Don Antonio arranged to take him to see thegalleys that lay at the beach, whereat Sancho was in high delight, as hehad never seen any all his life. Don Antonio sent word to the commandantof the galleys that he intended to bring his guest, the famous Don Quixoteof La Mancha, of whom the commandant and all the citizens had alreadyheard, that afternoon to see them; and what happened on board of them willbe told in the next chapter.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p62e" id="p62e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p62e.jpg (18K)" src="images/p62e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch63b" id="ch63b"></a>CHAPTER LXIII.<br/>OF THE MISHAP THAT BEFELL SANCHO PANZA THROUGH THE VISIT TO THE GALLEYS,AND THE STRANGE ADVENTURE OF THE FAIR MORISCO</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p63a" id="p63a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p63a.jpg (151K)" src="images/p63a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p63a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Profound were Don Quixote&rsquo;s reflections on the reply of theenchanted head, not one of them, however, hitting on the secret of thetrick, but all concentrated on the promise, which he regarded as acertainty, of Dulcinea&rsquo;s disenchantment. This he turned over in hismind again and again with great satisfaction, fully persuaded that hewould shortly see its fulfillment; and as for Sancho, though, as has beensaid, he hated being a governor, still he had a longing to be givingorders and finding himself obeyed once more; this is the misfortune thatbeing in authority, even in jest, brings with it.</p><p>To resume; that afternoon their host Don Antonio Moreno and his twofriends, with Don Quixote and Sancho, went to the galleys. The commandanthad been already made aware of his good fortune in seeing two such famouspersons as Don Quixote and Sancho, and the instant they came to the shoreall the galleys struck their awnings and the clarions rang out. A skiffcovered with rich carpets and cushions of crimson velvet was immediatelylowered into the water, and as Don Quixote stepped on board of it, theleading galley fired her gangway gun, and the other galleys did the same;and as he mounted the starboard ladder the whole crew saluted him (as isthe custom when a personage of distinction comes on board a galley) byexclaiming &ldquo;Hu, hu, hu,&rdquo; three times. The general, for so weshall call him, a Valencian gentleman of rank, gave him his hand andembraced him, saying, &ldquo;I shall mark this day with a white stone asone of the happiest I can expect to enjoy in my lifetime, since I haveseen Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, pattern and image wherein we seecontained and condensed all that is worthy in knight-errantry.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote delighted beyond measure with such a lordly reception, repliedto him in words no less courteous. All then proceeded to the poop, whichwas very handsomely decorated, and seated themselves on the bulwarkbenches; the boatswain passed along the gangway and piped all hands tostrip, which they did in an instant. Sancho, seeing such a number of menstripped to the skin, was taken aback, and still more when he saw themspread the awning so briskly that it seemed to him as if all the devilswere at work at it; but all this was cakes and fancy bread to what I amgoing to tell now. Sancho was seated on the captain&rsquo;s stage, closeto the aftermost rower on the right-hand side. He, previously instructedin what he was to do, laid hold of Sancho, hoisting him up in his arms,and the whole crew, who were standing ready, beginning on the right,proceeded to pass him on, whirling him along from hand to hand and frombench to bench with such rapidity that it took the sight out of poorSancho&rsquo;s eyes, and he made quite sure that the devils themselveswere flying away with him; nor did they leave off with him until they hadsent him back along the left side and deposited him on the poop; and thepoor fellow was left bruised and breathless and all in a sweat, and unableto comprehend what it was that had happened to him.</p><p>Don Quixote when he saw Sancho&rsquo;s flight without wings asked thegeneral if this was a usual ceremony with those who came on board thegalleys for the first time; for, if so, as he had no intention of adoptingthem as a profession, he had no mind to perform such feats of agility, andif anyone offered to lay hold of him to whirl him about, he vowed to Godhe would kick his soul out; and as he said this he stood up and clappedhis hand upon his sword. At this instant they struck the awning andlowered the yard with a prodigious rattle. Sancho thought heaven wascoming off its hinges and going to fall on his head, and full of terror heducked it and buried it between his knees; nor were Don Quixote&rsquo;sknees altogether under control, for he too shook a little, squeezed hisshoulders together and lost colour. The crew then hoisted the yard withthe same rapidity and clatter as when they lowered it, all the whilekeeping silence as though they had neither voice nor breath. The boatswaingave the signal to weigh anchor, and leaping upon the middle of thegangway began to lay on to the shoulders of the crew with his courbash orwhip, and to haul out gradually to sea.</p><p>When Sancho saw so many red feet (for such he took the oars to be) movingall together, he said to himself, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s these that are thereal chanted things, and not the ones my master talks of. What can thosewretches have done to be so whipped; and how does that one man who goesalong there whistling dare to whip so many? I declare this is hell, or atleast purgatory!&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote, observing how attentively Sancho regarded what was going on,said to him, &ldquo;Ah, Sancho my friend, how quickly and cheaply mightyou finish off the disenchantment of Dulcinea, if you would strip to thewaist and take your place among those gentlemen! Amid the pain andsufferings of so many you would not feel your own much; and moreoverperhaps the sage Merlin would allow each of these lashes, being laid onwith a good hand, to count for ten of those which you must give yourselfat last.&rdquo;</p><p>The general was about to ask what these lashes were, and what was Dulcinea&rsquo;sdisenchantment, when a sailor exclaimed, &ldquo;Monjui signals that thereis an oared vessel off the coast to the west.&rdquo;</p><p>On hearing this the general sprang upon the gangway crying, &ldquo;Nowthen, my sons, don&rsquo;t let her give us the slip! It must be someAlgerine corsair brigantine that the watchtower signals to us.&rdquo; Thethree others immediately came alongside the chief galley to receive theirorders. The general ordered two to put out to sea while he with the otherkept in shore, so that in this way the vessel could not escape them. Thecrews plied the oars driving the galleys so furiously that they seemed tofly. The two that had put out to sea, after a couple of miles sighted avessel which, so far as they could make out, they judged to be one offourteen or fifteen banks, and so she proved. As soon as the vesseldiscovered the galleys she went about with the object and in the hope ofmaking her escape by her speed; but the attempt failed, for the chiefgalley was one of the fastest vessels afloat, and overhauled her sorapidly that they on board the brigantine saw clearly there was nopossibility of escaping, and the rais therefore would have had them droptheir oars and give themselves up so as not to provoke the captain incommand of our galleys to anger. But chance, directing things otherwise,so ordered it that just as the chief galley came close enough for those onboard the vessel to hear the shouts from her calling on them to surrender,two Toraquis, that is to say two Turks, both drunken, that with a dozenmore were on board the brigantine, discharged their muskets, killing twoof the soldiers that lined the sides of our vessel. Seeing this thegeneral swore he would not leave one of those he found on board the vesselalive, but as he bore down furiously upon her she slipped away from himunderneath the oars. The galley shot a good way ahead; those on board thevessel saw their case was desperate, and while the galley was coming aboutthey made sail, and by sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off;but their activity did not do them as much good as their rashness did themharm, for the galley coming up with them in a little more than half a milethrew her oars over them and took the whole of them alive. The other twogalleys now joined company and all four returned with the prize to thebeach, where a vast multitude stood waiting for them, eager to see whatthey brought back. The general anchored close in, and perceived that theviceroy of the city was on the shore. He ordered the skiff to push off tofetch him, and the yard to be lowered for the purpose of hanging forthwiththe rais and the rest of the men taken on board the vessel, aboutsix-and-thirty in number, all smart fellows and most of them Turkishmusketeers. He asked which was the rais of the brigantine, and wasanswered in Spanish by one of the prisoners (who afterwards proved to be aSpanish renegade), &ldquo;This young man, señor, that you see here is ourrais,&rdquo; and he pointed to one of the handsomest and mostgallant-looking youths that could be imagined. He did not seem to betwenty years of age.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, dog,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;what led thee to killmy soldiers, when thou sawest it was impossible for thee to escape? Isthat the way to behave to chief galleys? Knowest thou not that rashness isnot valour? Faint prospects of success should make men bold, but not rash.&rdquo;</p><p>The rais was about to reply, but the general could not at that momentlisten to him, as he had to hasten to receive the viceroy, who was nowcoming on board the galley, and with him certain of his attendants andsome of the people.</p><p>&ldquo;You have had a good chase, señor general,&rdquo; said the viceroy.</p><p>&ldquo;Your excellency shall soon see how good, by the game strung up tothis yard,&rdquo; replied the general.</p><p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; returned the viceroy.</p><p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;against all law, reason,and usages of war they have killed on my hands two of the best soldiers onboard these galleys, and I have sworn to hang every man that I have taken,but above all this youth who is the rais of the brigantine,&rdquo; and hepointed to him as he stood with his hands already bound and the rope roundhis neck, ready for death.</p><p>The viceroy looked at him, and seeing him so well-favoured, so graceful,and so submissive, he felt a desire to spare his life, the comeliness ofthe youth furnishing him at once with a letter of recommendation. Hetherefore questioned him, saying, &ldquo;Tell me, rais, art thou Turk,Moor, or renegade?&rdquo;</p><p>To which the youth replied, also in Spanish, &ldquo;I am neither Turk, norMoor, nor renegade.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What art thou, then?&rdquo; said the viceroy.</p><p>&ldquo;A Christian woman,&rdquo; replied the youth.</p><p>&ldquo;A woman and a Christian, in such a dress and in such circumstances!It is more marvellous than credible,&rdquo; said the viceroy.</p><p>&ldquo;Suspend the execution of the sentence,&rdquo; said the youth;&ldquo;your vengeance will not lose much by waiting while I tell you thestory of my life.&rdquo;</p><p>What heart could be so hard as not to be softened by these words, at anyrate so far as to listen to what the unhappy youth had to say? The generalbade him say what he pleased, but not to expect pardon for his flagrantoffence. With this permission the youth began in these words.</p><p>&ldquo;Born of Morisco parents, I am of that nation, more unhappy thanwise, upon which of late a sea of woes has poured down. In the course ofour misfortune I was carried to Barbary by two uncles of mine, for it wasin vain that I declared I was a Christian, as in fact I am, and not a merepretended one, or outwardly, but a true Catholic Christian. It availed menothing with those charged with our sad expatriation to protest this, norwould my uncles believe it; on the contrary, they treated it as an untruthand a subterfuge set up to enable me to remain behind in the land of mybirth; and so, more by force than of my own will, they took me with them.I had a Christian mother, and a father who was a man of sound sense and aChristian too; I imbibed the Catholic faith with my mother&rsquo;s milk, Iwas well brought up, and neither in word nor in deed did I, I think, showany sign of being a Morisco. To accompany these virtues, for such I holdthem, my beauty, if I possess any, grew with my growth; and great as wasthe seclusion in which I lived it was not so great but that a younggentleman, Don Gaspar Gregorio by name, eldest son of a gentleman who islord of a village near ours, contrived to find opportunities of seeing me.How he saw me, how we met, how his heart was lost to me, and mine not keptfrom him, would take too long to tell, especially at a moment when I am indread of the cruel cord that threatens me interposing between tongue andthroat; I will only say, therefore, that Don Gregorio chose to accompanyme in our banishment. He joined company with the Moriscoes who were goingforth from other villages, for he knew their language very well, and onthe voyage he struck up a friendship with my two uncles who were carryingme with them; for my father, like a wise and far-sighted man, as soon ashe heard the first edict for our expulsion, quitted the village anddeparted in quest of some refuge for us abroad. He left hidden and buried,at a spot of which I alone have knowledge, a large quantity of pearls andprecious stones of great value, together with a sum of money in goldcruzadoes and doubloons. He charged me on no account to touch thetreasure, if by any chance they expelled us before his return. I obeyedhim, and with my uncles, as I have said, and others of our kindred andneighbours, passed over to Barbary, and the place where we took up ourabode was Algiers, much the same as if we had taken it up in hell itself.The king heard of my beauty, and report told him of my wealth, which wasin some degree fortunate for me. He summoned me before him, and asked mewhat part of Spain I came from, and what money and jewels I had. Imentioned the place, and told him the jewels and money were buried there;but that they might easily be recovered if I myself went back for them.All this I told him, in dread lest my beauty and not his own covetousnessshould influence him. While he was engaged in conversation with me, theybrought him word that in company with me was one of the handsomest andmost graceful youths that could be imagined. I knew at once that they werespeaking of Don Gaspar Gregorio, whose comeliness surpasses the mosthighly vaunted beauty. I was troubled when I thought of the danger he wasin, for among those barbarous Turks a fair youth is more esteemed than awoman, be she ever so beautiful. The king immediately ordered him to bebrought before him that he might see him, and asked me if what they saidabout the youth was true. I then, almost as if inspired by heaven, toldhim it was, but that I would have him to know it was not a man, but awoman like myself, and I entreated him to allow me to go and dress her inthe attire proper to her, so that her beauty might be seen to perfection,and that she might present herself before him with less embarrassment. Hebade me go by all means, and said that the next day we should discuss theplan to be adopted for my return to Spain to carry away the hiddentreasure. I saw Don Gaspar, I told him the danger he was in if he let itbe seen he was a man, I dressed him as a Moorish woman, and that sameafternoon I brought him before the king, who was charmed when he saw him,and resolved to keep the damsel and make a present of her to the GrandSignor; and to avoid the risk she might run among the women of hisseraglio, and distrustful of himself, he commanded her to be placed in thehouse of some Moorish ladies of rank who would protect and attend to her;and thither he was taken at once. What we both suffered (for I cannot denythat I love him) may be left to the imagination of those who are separatedif they love one another dearly. The king then arranged that I shouldreturn to Spain in this brigantine, and that two Turks, those who killedyour soldiers, should accompany me. There also came with me this Spanishrenegade&rdquo;&mdash;and here she pointed to him who had first spoken&mdash;&ldquo;whomI know to be secretly a Christian, and to be more desirous of being leftin Spain than of returning to Barbary. The rest of the crew of thebrigantine are Moors and Turks, who merely serve as rowers. The two Turks,greedy and insolent, instead of obeying the orders we had to land me andthis renegade in Christian dress (with which we came provided) on thefirst Spanish ground we came to, chose to run along the coast and makesome prize if they could, fearing that if they put us ashore first, wemight, in case of some accident befalling us, make it known that thebrigantine was at sea, and thus, if there happened to be any galleys onthe coast, they might be taken. We sighted this shore last night, andknowing nothing of these galleys, we were discovered, and the result waswhat you have seen. To sum up, there is Don Gregorio in woman&rsquo;sdress, among women, in imminent danger of his life; and here am I, withhands bound, in expectation, or rather in dread, of losing my life, ofwhich I am already weary. Here, sirs, ends my sad story, as true as it isunhappy; all I ask of you is to allow me to die like a Christian, for, asI have already said, I am not to be charged with the offence of whichthose of my nation are guilty;&rdquo; and she stood silent, her eyesfilled with moving tears, accompanied by plenty from the bystanders. Theviceroy, touched with compassion, went up to her without speaking anduntied the cord that bound the hands of the Moorish girl.</p><p>But all the while the Morisco Christian was telling her strange story, anelderly pilgrim, who had come on board of the galley at the same time asthe viceroy, kept his eyes fixed upon her; and the instant she ceasedspeaking he threw himself at her feet, and embracing them said in a voicebroken by sobs and sighs, &ldquo;O Ana Felix, my unhappy daughter, I amthy father Ricote, come back to look for thee, unable to live withoutthee, my soul that thou art!&rdquo;</p><p>At these words of his, Sancho opened his eyes and raised his head, whichhe had been holding down, brooding over his unlucky excursion; and lookingat the pilgrim he recognised in him that same Ricote he met the day hequitted his government, and felt satisfied that this was his daughter. Shebeing now unbound embraced her father, mingling her tears with his, whilehe addressing the general and the viceroy said, &ldquo;This, sirs, is mydaughter, more unhappy in her adventures than in her name. She is AnaFelix, surnamed Ricote, celebrated as much for her own beauty as for mywealth. I quitted my native land in search of some shelter or refuge forus abroad, and having found one in Germany I returned in this pilgrim&rsquo;sdress, in the company of some other German pilgrims, to seek my daughterand take up a large quantity of treasure I had left buried. My daughter Idid not find, the treasure I found and have with me; and now, in thisstrange roundabout way you have seen, I find the treasure that more thanall makes me rich, my beloved daughter. If our innocence and her tears andmine can with strict justice open the door to clemency, extend it to us,for we never had any intention of injuring you, nor do we sympathise withthe aims of our people, who have been justly banished.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know Ricote well,&rdquo; said Sancho at this, &ldquo;and I knowtoo that what he says about Ana Felix being his daughter is true; but asto those other particulars about going and coming, and having good or badintentions, I say nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>While all present stood amazed at this strange occurrence the generalsaid, &ldquo;At any rate your tears will not allow me to keep my oath;live, fair Ana Felix, all the years that heaven has allotted you; butthese rash insolent fellows must pay the penalty of the crime they havecommitted;&rdquo; and with that he gave orders to have the two Turks whohad killed his two soldiers hanged at once at the yard-arm. The viceroy,however, begged him earnestly not to hang them, as their behavioursavoured rather of madness than of bravado. The general yielded to theviceroy&rsquo;s request, for revenge is not easily taken in cold blood.They then tried to devise some scheme for rescuing Don Gaspar Gregoriofrom the danger in which he had been left. Ricote offered for that objectmore than two thousand ducats that he had in pearls and gems; theyproposed several plans, but none so good as that suggested by the renegadealready mentioned, who offered to return to Algiers in a small vessel ofabout six banks, manned by Christian rowers, as he knew where, how, andwhen he could and should land, nor was he ignorant of the house in whichDon Gaspar was staying. The general and the viceroy had some hesitationabout placing confidence in the renegade and entrusting him with theChristians who were to row, but Ana Felix said she could answer for him,and her father offered to go and pay the ransom of the Christians if byany chance they should not be forthcoming. This, then, being agreed upon,the viceroy landed, and Don Antonio Moreno took the fair Morisco and herfather home with him, the viceroy charging him to give them the bestreception and welcome in his power, while on his own part he offered allthat house contained for their entertainment; so great was the good-willand kindliness the beauty of Ana Felix had infused into his heart.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p63e" id="p63e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p63e.jpg (23K)" src="images/p63e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch64b" id="ch64b"></a>CHAPTER LXIV.<br/>TREATING OF THE ADVENTURE WHICH GAVE DON QUIXOTE MORE UNHAPPINESS THAN ALLTHAT HAD HITHERTO BEFALLEN HIM</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p64a" id="p64a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p64a.jpg (80K)" src="images/p64a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p64a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The wife of Don Antonio Moreno, so the history says, was extremely happyto see Ana Felix in her house. She welcomed her with great kindness,charmed as well by her beauty as by her intelligence; for in both respectsthe fair Morisco was richly endowed, and all the people of the cityflocked to see her as though they had been summoned by the ringing of thebells.</p><p>Don Quixote told Don Antonio that the plan adopted for releasing DonGregorio was not a good one, for its risks were greater than itsadvantages, and that it would be better to land himself with his arms andhorse in Barbary; for he would carry him off in spite of the whole Moorishhost, as Don Gaiferos carried off his wife Melisendra.</p><p>&ldquo;Remember, your worship,&rdquo; observed Sancho on hearing him sayso, &ldquo;Señor Don Gaiferos carried off his wife from the mainland, andtook her to France by land; but in this case, if by chance we carry offDon Gregorio, we have no way of bringing him to Spain, for there&rsquo;sthe sea between.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a remedy for everything except death,&rdquo; said DonQuixote; &ldquo;if they bring the vessel close to the shore we shall beable to get on board though all the world strive to prevent us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your worship hits it off mighty well and mighty easy,&rdquo; saidSancho; &ldquo;but &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a long step from saying to doing;&rsquo;and I hold to the renegade, for he seems to me an honest good-heartedfellow.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Antonio then said that if the renegade did not prove successful, theexpedient of the great Don Quixote&rsquo;s expedition to Barbary should beadopted. Two days afterwards the renegade put to sea in a light vessel ofsix oars a-side manned by a stout crew, and two days later the galleysmade sail eastward, the general having begged the viceroy to let him knowall about the release of Don Gregorio and about Ana Felix, and the viceroypromised to do as he requested.</p><p>One morning as Don Quixote went out for a stroll along the beach, arrayedin full armour (for, as he often said, that was &ldquo;his only gear, hisonly rest the fray,&rdquo; and he never was without it for a moment), hesaw coming towards him a knight, also in full armour, with a shining moonpainted on his shield, who, on approaching sufficiently near to be heard,said in a loud voice, addressing himself to Don Quixote, &ldquo;Illustriousknight, and never sufficiently extolled Don Quixote of La Mancha, I am theKnight of the White Moon, whose unheard-of achievements will perhaps haverecalled him to thy memory. I come to do battle with thee and prove themight of thy arm, to the end that I make thee acknowledge and confess thatmy lady, let her be who she may, is incomparably fairer than thy Dulcineadel Toboso. If thou dost acknowledge this fairly and openly, thou shaltescape death and save me the trouble of inflicting it upon thee; if thoufightest and I vanquish thee, I demand no other satisfaction than that,laying aside arms and abstaining from going in quest of adventures, thouwithdraw and betake thyself to thine own village for the space of a year,and live there without putting hand to sword, in peace and quiet andbeneficial repose, the same being needful for the increase of thysubstance and the salvation of thy soul; and if thou dost vanquish me, myhead shall be at thy disposal, my arms and horse thy spoils, and therenown of my deeds transferred and added to thine. Consider which will bethy best course, and give me thy answer speedily, for this day is all thetime I have for the despatch of this business.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote was amazed and astonished, as well at the Knight of the WhiteMoon&rsquo;s arrogance, as at his reason for delivering the defiance, andwith calm dignity he answered him, &ldquo;Knight of the White Moon, ofwhose achievements I have never heard until now, I will venture to swearyou have never seen the illustrious Dulcinea; for had you seen her I knowyou would have taken care not to venture yourself upon this issue, becausethe sight would have removed all doubt from your mind that there ever hasbeen or can be a beauty to be compared with hers; and so, not saying youlie, but merely that you are not correct in what you state, I accept yourchallenge, with the conditions you have proposed, and at once, that theday you have fixed may not expire; and from your conditions I except onlythat of the renown of your achievements being transferred to me, for Iknow not of what sort they are nor what they may amount to; I am satisfiedwith my own, such as they be. Take, therefore, the side of the field youchoose, and I will do the same; and to whom God shall give it may SaintPeter add his blessing.&rdquo;</p><p>The Knight of the White Moon had been seen from the city, and it was toldthe viceroy how he was in conversation with Don Quixote. The viceroy,fancying it must be some fresh adventure got up by Don Antonio Moreno orsome other gentleman of the city, hurried out at once to the beachaccompanied by Don Antonio and several other gentlemen, just as DonQuixote was wheeling Rocinante round in order to take up the necessarydistance. The viceroy upon this, seeing that the pair of them wereevidently preparing to come to the charge, put himself between them,asking them what it was that led them to engage in combat all of a suddenin this way. The Knight of the White Moon replied that it was a questionof precedence of beauty; and briefly told him what he had said to DonQuixote, and how the conditions of the defiance agreed upon on both sideshad been accepted. The viceroy went over to Don Antonio, and asked in alow voice did he know who the Knight of the White Moon was, or was it somejoke they were playing on Don Quixote. Don Antonio replied that he neitherknew who he was nor whether the defiance was in joke or in earnest. Thisanswer left the viceroy in a state of perplexity, not knowing whether heought to let the combat go on or not; but unable to persuade himself thatit was anything but a joke he fell back, saying, &ldquo;If there be noother way out of it, gallant knights, except to confess or die, and DonQuixote is inflexible, and your worship of the White Moon still more so,in God&rsquo;s hand be it, and fall on.&rdquo;</p><p>He of the White Moon thanked the viceroy in courteous and well-chosenwords for the permission he gave them, and so did Don Quixote, who then,commending himself with all his heart to heaven and to his Dulcinea, aswas his custom on the eve of any combat that awaited him, proceeded totake a little more distance, as he saw his antagonist was doing the same;then, without blast of trumpet or other warlike instrument to give themthe signal to charge, both at the same instant wheeled their horses; andhe of the White Moon, being the swifter, met Don Quixote after havingtraversed two-thirds of the course, and there encountered him with suchviolence that, without touching him with his lance (for he held it high,to all appearance purposely), he hurled Don Quixote and Rocinante to theearth, a perilous fall. He sprang upon him at once, and placing the lanceover his visor said to him, &ldquo;You are vanquished, sir knight, naydead unless you admit the conditions of our defiance.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote, bruised and stupefied, without raising his visor said in aweak feeble voice as if he were speaking out of a tomb, &ldquo;Dulcineadel Toboso is the fairest woman in the world, and I the most unfortunateknight on earth; it is not fitting that this truth should suffer by myfeebleness; drive your lance home, sir knight, and take my life, since youhave taken away my honour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That will I not, in sooth,&rdquo; said he of the White Moon;&ldquo;live the fame of the lady Dulcinea&rsquo;s beauty undimmed as ever;all I require is that the great Don Quixote retire to his own home for ayear, or for so long a time as shall by me be enjoined upon him, as weagreed before engaging in this combat.&rdquo;</p><p>The viceroy, Don Antonio, and several others who were present heard allthis, and heard too how Don Quixote replied that so long as nothing inprejudice of Dulcinea was demanded of him, he would observe all the restlike a true and loyal knight. The engagement given, he of the White Moonwheeled about, and making obeisance to the viceroy with a movement of thehead, rode away into the city at a half gallop.

Here was his master defeated, and bound not to takeup arms for a year. He saw the light of the glory of his achievementsobscured; the hopes of the promises lately made him swept away like smokebefore the wind; Rocinante, he feared, was crippled for life, and hismaster&rsquo;s bones out of joint; for if he were only shaken out of hismadness it would be no small luck. In the end they carried him into thecity in a hand-chair which the viceroy sent for, and thither the viceroyhimself returned, eager to ascertain who this Knight of the White Moon waswho had left Don Quixote in such a sad plight.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p64e" id="p64e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p64e.jpg (44K)" src="images/p64e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p64e.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch65b" id="ch65b"></a>CHAPTER LXV.<br/>WHEREIN IS MADE KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE WHITE MOON WAS; LIKEWISE DONGREGORIO&rsquo;S RELEASE, AND OTHER EVENTS</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p65a" id="p65a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p65a.jpg (149K)" src="images/p65a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p65a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Don Antonio Moreno followed the Knight of the White Moon, and a number ofboys followed him too, nay pursued him, until they had him fairly housedin a hostel in the heart of the city. Don Antonio, eager to make hisacquaintance, entered also; a squire came out to meet him and remove hisarmour, and he shut himself into a lower room, still attended by DonAntonio, whose bread would not bake until he had found out who he was. Heof the White Moon, seeing then that the gentleman would not leave him,said, &ldquo;I know very well, señor, what you have come for; it is tofind out who I am; and as there is no reason why I should conceal it fromyou, while my servant here is taking off my armour I will tell you thetrue state of the case, without leaving out anything. You must know,señor, that I am called the bachelor Samson Carrasco. I am of the samevillage as Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose craze and folly make all of uswho know him feel pity for him, and I am one of those who have felt itmost; and persuaded that his chance of recovery lay in quiet and keepingat home and in his own house, I hit upon a device for keeping him there.Three months ago, therefore, I went out to meet him as a knight-errant,under the assumed name of the Knight of the Mirrors, intending to engagehim in combat and overcome him without hurting him, making it thecondition of our combat that the vanquished should be at the disposal ofthe victor. What I meant to demand of him (for I regarded him asvanquished already) was that he should return to his own village, and notleave it for a whole year, by which time he might be cured. But fateordered it otherwise, for he vanquished me and unhorsed me, and so my planfailed. He went his way, and I came back conquered, covered with shame,and sorely bruised by my fall, which was a particularly dangerous one. Butthis did not quench my desire to meet him again and overcome him, as youhave seen to-day. And as he is so scrupulous in his observance of the lawsof knight-errantry, he will, no doubt, in order to keep his word, obey theinjunction I have laid upon him. This, señor, is how the matter stands,and I have nothing more to tell you. I implore of you not to betray me, ortell Don Quixote who I am; so that my honest endeavours may be successful,and that a man of excellent wits&mdash;were he only rid of the fooleriesof chivalry&mdash;may get them back again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O señor,&rdquo; said Don Antonio, &ldquo;may God forgive you thewrong you have done the whole world in trying to bring the most amusingmadman in it back to his senses. Do you not see, señor, that the gain byDon Quixote&rsquo;s sanity can never equal the enjoyment his crazes give?But my belief is that all the señor bachelor&rsquo;s pains will be of noavail to bring a man so hopelessly cracked to his senses again; and if itwere not uncharitable, I would say may Don Quixote never be cured, for byhis recovery we lose not only his own drolleries, but his squire SanchoPanza&rsquo;s too, any one of which is enough to turn melancholy itselfinto merriment. However, I&rsquo;ll hold my peace and say nothing to him,and we&rsquo;ll see whether I am right in my suspicion that Señor Carrasco&rsquo;sefforts will be fruitless.&rdquo;</p><p>The bachelor replied that at all events the affair promised well, and hehoped for a happy result from it; and putting his services at Don Antonio&rsquo;scommands he took his leave of him; and having had his armour packed atonce upon a mule, he rode away from the city the same day on the horse herode to battle, and returned to his own country without meeting anyadventure calling for record in this veracious history.</p><p>Don Antonio reported to the viceroy what Carrasco told him, and theviceroy was not very well pleased to hear it, for with Don Quixote&rsquo;sretirement there was an end to the amusement of all who knew anything ofhis mad doings.</p><p>Six days did Don Quixote keep his bed, dejected, melancholy, moody and outof sorts, brooding over the unhappy event of his defeat. Sancho strove tocomfort him, and among other things he said to him, &ldquo;Hold up yourhead, señor, and be of good cheer if you can, and give thanks to heaventhat if you have had a tumble to the ground you have not come off with abroken rib; and, as you know that &lsquo;where they give they take,&rsquo;and that &lsquo;there are not always fletches where there are pegs,&rsquo;a fig for the doctor, for there&rsquo;s no need of him to cure thisailment. Let us go home, and give over going about in search of adventuresin strange lands and places; rightly looked at, it is I that am thegreater loser, though it is your worship that has had the worse usage.With the government I gave up all wish to be a governor again, but I didnot give up all longing to be a count; and that will never come to pass ifyour worship gives up becoming a king by renouncing the calling ofchivalry; and so my hopes are going to turn into smoke.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peace, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;thou seest mysuspension and retirement is not to exceed a year; I shall soon return tomy honoured calling, and I shall not be at a loss for a kingdom to win anda county to bestow on thee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May God hear it and sin be deaf,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;I havealways heard say that &lsquo;a good hope is better than a bad holding.&rdquo;</p><p>As they were talking Don Antonio came in looking extremely pleased andexclaiming, &ldquo;Reward me for my good news, Señor Don Quixote! DonGregorio and the renegade who went for him have come ashore&mdash;ashoredo I say? They are by this time in the viceroy&rsquo;s house, and will behere immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote cheered up a little and said, &ldquo;Of a truth I am almostready to say I should have been glad had it turned out just the other way,for it would have obliged me to cross over to Barbary, where by the mightof my arm I should have restored to liberty, not only Don Gregorio, butall the Christian captives there are in Barbary. But what am I saying,miserable being that I am? Am I not he that has been conquered? Am I nothe that has been overthrown? Am I not he who must not take up arms for ayear? Then what am I making professions for; what am I bragging about;when it is fitter for me to handle the distaff than the sword?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No more of that, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;&lsquo;let thehen live, even though it be with her pip;&rsquo; &lsquo;to-day for thee andto-morrow for me;&rsquo; in these affairs of encounters and whacks onemust not mind them, for he that falls to-day may get up to-morrow; unlessindeed he chooses to lie in bed, I mean gives way to weakness and does notpluck up fresh spirit for fresh battles; let your worship get up now toreceive Don Gregorio; for the household seems to be in a bustle, and nodoubt he has come by this time;&rdquo; and so it proved, for as soon asDon Gregorio and the renegade had given the viceroy an account of thevoyage out and home, Don Gregorio, eager to see Ana Felix, came with therenegade to Don Antonio&rsquo;s house. When they carried him away fromAlgiers he was in woman&rsquo;s dress; on board the vessel, however, heexchanged it for that of a captive who escaped with him; but in whateverdress he might be he looked like one to be loved and served and esteemed,for he was surpassingly well-favoured, and to judge by appearances someseventeen or eighteen years of age. Ricote and his daughter came out towelcome him, the father with tears, the daughter with bashfulness. Theydid not embrace each other, for where there is deep love there will neverbe overmuch boldness. Seen side by side, the comeliness of Don Gregorioand the beauty of Ana Felix were the admiration of all who were present.It was silence that spoke for the lovers at that moment, and their eyeswere the tongues that declared their pure and happy feelings. The renegadeexplained the measures and means he had adopted to rescue Don Gregorio,and Don Gregorio at no great length, but in a few words, in which heshowed that his intelligence was in advance of his years, described theperil and embarrassment he found himself in among the women with whom hehad sojourned. To conclude, Ricote liberally recompensed and rewarded aswell the renegade as the men who had rowed; and the renegade effected hisreadmission into the body of the Church and was reconciled with it, andfrom a rotten limb became by penance and repentance a clean and sound one.</p><p>Two days later the viceroy discussed with Don Antonio the steps theyshould take to enable Ana Felix and her father to stay in Spain, for itseemed to them there could be no objection to a daughter who was so good aChristian and a father to all appearance so well disposed remaining there.Don Antonio offered to arrange the matter at the capital, whither he wascompelled to go on some other business, hinting that many a difficultaffair was settled there with the help of favour and bribes.</p><p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Ricote, who was present during the conversation,&ldquo;it will not do to rely upon favour or bribes, because with thegreat Don Bernardino de Velasco, Conde de Salazar, to whom his Majesty hasentrusted our expulsion, neither entreaties nor promises, bribes norappeals to compassion, are of any use; for though it is true he minglesmercy with justice, still, seeing that the whole body of our nation istainted and corrupt, he applies to it the cautery that burns rather thanthe salve that soothes; and thus, by prudence, sagacity, care and the fearhe inspires, he has borne on his mighty shoulders the weight of this greatpolicy and carried it into effect, all our schemes and plots,importunities and wiles, being ineffectual to blind his Argus eyes, everon the watch lest one of us should remain behind in concealment, and likea hidden root come in course of time to sprout and bear poisonous fruit inSpain, now cleansed, and relieved of the fear in which our vast numberskept it. Heroic resolve of the great Philip the Third, and unparalleledwisdom to have entrusted it to the said Don Bernardino de Velasco!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said Don Antonio, &ldquo;when I am there I willmake all possible efforts, and let heaven do as pleases it best; DonGregorio will come with me to relieve the anxiety which his parents mustbe suffering on account of his absence; Ana Felix will remain in my housewith my wife, or in a monastery; and I know the viceroy will be glad thatthe worthy Ricote should stay with him until we see what terms I can make.&rdquo;</p><p>The viceroy agreed to all that was proposed; but Don Gregorio on learningwhat had passed declared he could not and would not on any account leaveAna Felix; however, as it was his purpose to go and see his parents anddevise some way of returning for her, he fell in with the proposedarrangement. Ana Felix remained with Don Antonio&rsquo;s wife, and Ricotein the viceroy&rsquo;s house.</p><p>The day for Don Antonio&rsquo;s departure came; and two days later thatfor Don Quixote&rsquo;s and Sancho&rsquo;s, for Don Quixote&rsquo;s falldid not suffer him to take the road sooner. There were tears and sighs,swoonings and sobs, at the parting between Don Gregorio and Ana Felix.Ricote offered Don Gregorio a thousand crowns if he would have them, buthe would not take any save five which Don Antonio lent him and he promisedto repay at the capital. So the two of them took their departure, and DonQuixote and Sancho afterwards, as has been already said, Don Quixotewithout his armour and in travelling gear, and Sancho on foot, Dapplebeing loaded with the armour.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p65e" id="p65e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p65e.jpg (43K)" src="images/p65e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch66b" id="ch66b"></a>CHAPTER LXVI.<br/>WHICH TREATS OF WHAT HE WHO READS WILL SEE, OR WHAT HE WHO HAS IT READ TOHIM WILL HEAR</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p66a" id="p66a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p66a.jpg (125K)" src="images/p66a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p66a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>As he left Barcelona, Don Quixote turned gaze upon the spot where he hadfallen. &ldquo;Here Troy was,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;here my ill-luck, notmy cowardice, robbed me of all the glory I had won; here Fortune made methe victim of her caprices; here the lustre of my achievements was dimmed;here, in a word, fell my happiness never to rise again.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p66b" id="p66b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p66b.jpg (251K)" src="images/p66b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p66b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; said Sancho on hearing this, &ldquo;it is the part ofbrave hearts to be patient in adversity just as much as to be glad inprosperity; I judge by myself, for, if when I was a governor I was glad,now that I am a squire and on foot I am not sad; and I have heard say thatshe whom commonly they call Fortune is a drunken whimsical jade, and, whatis more, blind, and therefore neither sees what she does, nor knows whomshe casts down or whom she sets up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art a great philosopher, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;thou speakest very sensibly; I know not who taught thee. But I cantell thee there is no such thing as Fortune in the world, nor doesanything which takes place there, be it good or bad, come about by chance,but by the special preordination of heaven; and hence the common sayingthat &lsquo;each of us is the maker of his own Fortune.&rsquo; I have beenthat of mine; but not with the proper amount of prudence, and myself-confidence has therefore made me pay dearly; for I ought to havereflected that Rocinante&rsquo;s feeble strength could not resist themighty bulk of the Knight of the White Moon&rsquo;s horse. In a word, Iventured it, I did my best, I was overthrown, but though I lost my honourI did not lose nor can I lose the virtue of keeping my word.

Let us leave this armour hung up on some tree, instead ofsomeone that has been hanged; and then with me on Dapple&rsquo;s back andmy feet off the ground we will arrange the stages as your worship pleasesto measure them out; but to suppose that I am going to travel on foot, andmake long ones, is to suppose nonsense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou sayest well, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;let myarmour be hung up for a trophy, and under it or round it we will carve onthe trees what was inscribed on the trophy of Roland&rsquo;s armour-</p><p class="poem">These let none move<br/>Who dareth not his might with Roland prove.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;and if itwas not that we should feel the want of Rocinante on the road, it would beas well to leave him hung up too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And yet, I had rather not have either him or the armour hung up,&rdquo;said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that it may not be said, &lsquo;for good servicea bad return.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your worship is right,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;for, as sensiblepeople hold, &lsquo;the fault of the ass must not be laid on thepack-saddle;&rsquo; and, as in this affair the fault is your worship&rsquo;s,punish yourself and don&rsquo;t let your anger break out against thealready battered and bloody armour, or the meekness of Rocinante, or thetenderness of my feet, trying to make them travel more than is reasonable.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p66c" id="p66c"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p66c.jpg (389K)" src="images/p66c.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p66c.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>In converse of this sort the whole of that day went by, as did the foursucceeding ones, without anything occurring to interrupt their journey,but on the fifth as they entered a village they found a great number ofpeople at the door of an inn enjoying themselves, as it was a holiday.Upon Don Quixote&rsquo;s approach a peasant called out, &ldquo;One ofthese two gentlemen who come here, and who don&rsquo;t know the parties,will tell us what we ought to do about our wager.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I will, certainly,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;andaccording to the rights of the case, if I can manage to understand it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, here it is, worthy sir,&rdquo; said the peasant; &ldquo;a manof this village who is so fat that he weighs twenty stone challengedanother, a neighbour of his, who does not weigh more than nine, to run arace. The agreement was that they were to run a distance of a hundredpaces with equal weights; and when the challenger was asked how theweights were to be equalised he said that the other, as he weighed ninestone, should put eleven in iron on his back, and that in this way thetwenty stone of the thin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; exclaimed Sancho at once, before Don Quixotecould answer; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s for me, that only a few days ago left offbeing a governor and a judge, as all the world knows, to settle thesedoubtful questions and give an opinion in disputes of all sorts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Answer in God&rsquo;s name, Sancho my friend,&rdquo; said DonQuixote, &ldquo;for I am not fit to give crumbs to a cat, my wits are soconfused and upset.&rdquo;</p><p>With this permission Sancho said to the peasants who stood clustered roundhim, waiting with open mouths for the decision to come from his, &ldquo;Brothers,what the fat man requires is not in reason, nor has it a shadow of justicein it; because, if it be true, as they say, that the challenged may choosethe weapons, the other has no right to choose such as will prevent andkeep him from winning. My decision, therefore, is that the fat challengerprune, peel, thin, trim and correct himself, and take eleven stone of hisflesh off his body, here or there, as he pleases, and as suits him best;and being in this way reduced to nine stone weight, he will make himselfequal and even with nine stone of his opponent, and they will be able torun on equal terms.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By all that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said one of the peasants as heheard Sancho&rsquo;s decision, &ldquo;but the gentleman has spoken like asaint, and given judgment like a canon! But I&rsquo;ll be bound the fatman won&rsquo;t part with an ounce of his flesh, not to say eleven stone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The best plan will be for them not to run,&rdquo; said another,&ldquo;so that neither the thin man break down under the weight, nor thefat one strip himself of his flesh; let half the wager be spent in wine,and let&rsquo;s take these gentlemen to the tavern where there&rsquo;s thebest, and &lsquo;over me be the cloak when it rains.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thank you, sirs,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but I cannotstop for an instant, for sad thoughts and unhappy circumstances force meto seem discourteous and to travel apace;&rdquo; and spurring Rocinante hepushed on, leaving them wondering at what they had seen and heard, at hisown strange figure and at the shrewdness of his servant, for such theytook Sancho to be; and another of them observed, &ldquo;If the servant isso clever, what must the master be? I&rsquo;ll bet, if they are going toSalamanca to study, they&rsquo;ll come to be alcaldes of the Court in atrice; for it&rsquo;s a mere joke&mdash;only to read and read, and haveinterest and good luck; and before a man knows where he is he findshimself with a staff in his hand or a mitre on his head.&rdquo;</p><p>That night master and man passed out in the fields in the open air, andthe next day as they were pursuing their journey they saw coming towardsthem a man on foot with alforjas at the neck and a javelin or spiked staffin his hand, the very cut of a foot courier; who, as soon as he came closeto Don Quixote, increased his pace and half running came up to him, andembracing his right thigh, for he could reach no higher, exclaimed withevident pleasure, &ldquo;O Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, what happinessit will be to the heart of my lord the duke when he knows your worship iscoming back to his castle, for he is still there with my lady the duchess!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not recognise you, friend,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;nordo I know who you are, unless you tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am Tosilos, my lord the duke&rsquo;s lacquey, Señor Don Quixote,&rdquo;replied the courier; &ldquo;he who refused to fight your worship aboutmarrying the daughter of Doña Rodriguez.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God bless me!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Quixote; &ldquo;is it possiblethat you are the one whom mine enemies the enchanters changed into thelacquey you speak of in order to rob me of the honour of that battle?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nonsense, good sir!&rdquo; said the messenger; &ldquo;there was noenchantment or transformation at all; I entered the lists just as muchlacquey Tosilos as I came out of them lacquey Tosilos.

I see it plainenough, and I tell him so plain enough; but what&rsquo;s the use?especially now that it is all over with him, for here he is beaten by theKnight of the White Moon.&rdquo;</p><p>Tosilos begged him to explain what had happened him, but Sancho repliedthat it would not be good manners to leave his master waiting for him; andthat some other day if they met there would be time enough for that; andthen getting up, after shaking his doublet and brushing the crumbs out ofhis beard, he drove Dapple on before him, and bidding adieu to Tosilosleft him and rejoined his master, who was waiting for him under the shadeof a tree.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p66e" id="p66e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p66e.jpg (29K)" src="images/p66e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch67b" id="ch67b"></a>CHAPTER LXVII.<br/>OF THE RESOLUTION DON QUIXOTE FORMED TO TURN SHEPHERD AND TAKE TO A LIFEIN THE FIELDS WHILE THE YEAR FOR WHICH HE HAD GIVEN HIS WORD WAS RUNNINGITS COURSE; WITH OTHER EVENTS TRULY DELECTABLE AND HAPPY</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p67a" id="p67a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p67a.jpg (145K)" src="images/p67a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p67a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>If a multitude of reflections used to harass Don Quixote before he hadbeen overthrown, a great many more harassed him since his fall. He wasunder the shade of a tree, as has been said, and there, like flies onhoney, thoughts came crowding upon him and stinging him. Some of themturned upon the disenchantment of Dulcinea, others upon the life he wasabout to lead in his enforced retirement. Sancho came up and spoke in highpraise of the generous disposition of the lacquey Tosilos.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it possible, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that thoudost still think that he yonder is a real lacquey? Apparently it hasescaped thy memory that thou hast seen Dulcinea turned and transformedinto a peasant wench, and the Knight of the Mirrors into the bachelorCarrasco; all the work of the enchanters that persecute me. But tell menow, didst thou ask this Tosilos, as thou callest him, what has become ofAltisidora, did she weep over my absence, or has she already consigned tooblivion the love thoughts that used to afflict her when I was present?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The thoughts that I had,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;were not suchas to leave time for asking fool&rsquo;s questions. Body o&rsquo; me,señor! is your worship in a condition now to inquire into other people&rsquo;sthoughts, above all love thoughts?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look ye, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;there is a greatdifference between what is done out of love and what is done out ofgratitude. A knight may very possibly be proof against love; but it isimpossible, strictly speaking, for him to be ungrateful. Altisidora, toall appearance, loved me truly; she gave me the three kerchiefs thouknowest of; she wept at my departure, she cursed me, she abused me,casting shame to the winds she bewailed herself in public; all signs thatshe adored me; for the wrath of lovers always ends in curses. I had nohopes to give her, nor treasures to offer her, for mine are given toDulcinea, and the treasures of knights-errant are like those of thefairies,&rsquo; illusory and deceptive; all I can give her is the place inmy memory I keep for her, without prejudice, however, to that which I holddevoted to Dulcinea, whom thou art wronging by thy remissness in whippingthyself and scourging that flesh&mdash;would that I saw it eaten by wolves&mdash;whichwould rather keep itself for the worms than for the relief of that poorlady.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;if the truth is to be told, Icannot persuade myself that the whipping of my backside has anything to dowith the disenchantment of the enchanted; it is like saying, &lsquo;Ifyour head aches rub ointment on your knees;&rsquo; at any rate I&rsquo;llmake bold to swear that in all the histories dealing with knight-errantrythat your worship has read you have never come across anybody disenchantedby whipping; but whether or no I&rsquo;ll whip myself when I have a fancyfor it, and the opportunity serves for scourging myself comfortably.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God grant it,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;and heaven give theegrace to take it to heart and own the obligation thou art under to help mylady, who is thine also, inasmuch as thou art mine.&rdquo;</p><p>As they pursued their journey talking in this way they came to the verysame spot where they had been trampled on by the bulls. Don Quixoterecognised it, and said he to Sancho, &ldquo;This is the meadow where wecame upon those gay shepherdesses and gallant shepherds who were trying torevive and imitate the pastoral Arcadia there, an idea as novel as it washappy, in emulation whereof, if so be thou dost approve of it, Sancho, Iwould have ourselves turn shepherds, at any rate for the time I have tolive in retirement. I will buy some ewes and everything else requisite forthe pastoral calling; and, I under the name of the shepherd Quixotize andthou as the shepherd Panzino, we will roam the woods and groves andmeadows singing songs here, lamenting in elegies there, drinking of thecrystal waters of the springs or limpid brooks or flowing rivers. The oakswill yield us their sweet fruit with bountiful hand, the trunks of thehard cork trees a seat, the willows shade, the roses perfume, thewidespread meadows carpets tinted with a thousand dyes; the clear pure airwill give us breath, the moon and stars lighten the darkness of the nightfor us, song shall be our delight, lamenting our joy, Apollo will supplyus with verses, and love with conceits whereby we shall make ourselvesfamed for ever, not only in this but in ages to come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Egad,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;but that sort of life squares, naycorners, with my notions; and what is more the bachelor Samson Carrascoand Master Nicholas the barber won&rsquo;t have well seen it before they&rsquo;llwant to follow it and turn shepherds along with us; and God grant it maynot come into the curate&rsquo;s head to join the sheepfold too, he&rsquo;sso jovial and fond of enjoying himself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art in the right of it, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;and the bachelor Samson Carrasco, if he enters the pastoralfraternity, as no doubt he will, may call himself the shepherd Samsonino,or perhaps the shepherd Carrascon; Nicholas the barber may call himselfNiculoso, as old Boscan formerly was called Nemoroso; as for the curate Idon&rsquo;t know what name we can fit to him unless it be somethingderived from his title, and we call him the shepherd Curiambro. For theshepherdesses whose lovers we shall be, we can pick names as we wouldpears; and as my lady&rsquo;s name does just as well for a shepherdess&rsquo;sas for a princess&rsquo;s, I need not trouble myself to look for one thatwill suit her better; to thine, Sancho, thou canst give what name thouwilt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to give her any but Teresona,&rdquo; saidSancho, &ldquo;which will go well with her stoutness and with her ownright name, as she is called Teresa; and then when I sing her praises inmy verses I&rsquo;ll show how chaste my passion is, for I&rsquo;m notgoing to look &lsquo;for better bread than ever came from wheat&rsquo; inother men&rsquo;s houses. It won&rsquo;t do for the curate to have ashepherdess, for the sake of good example; and if the bachelor chooses tohave one, that is his look-out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;God bless me, Sancho my friend!&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;whata life we shall lead! What hautboys and Zamora bagpipes we shall hear,what tabors, timbrels, and rebecks! And then if among all these differentsorts of music that of the albogues is heard, almost all the pastoralinstruments will be there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are albogues?&rdquo; asked Sancho, &ldquo;for I never in mylife heard tell of them or saw them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Albogues,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;are brass plates likecandlesticks that struck against one another on the hollow side make a noisewhich, if not very pleasing or harmonious, is not disagreeable and accords verywell with the rude notes of the bagpipe and tabor. The word albogue is Morisco,as are all those in our Spanish tongue that begin with <i>al;</i> for example,<i>almohaza, almorzar, alhombra, alguacil, alhucema, almacen, alcancia</i>, andothers of the same sort, of which there are not many more; our language hasonly three that are Morisco and end in <i>i</i>, which are <i>borceguí,zaquizamí</i>, and <i>maravedí. Alhelí</i> and <i>alfaquí</i> are seen to beArabic, as well by the <i>al</i> at the beginning as by the <i>í</i> they endwith. I mention this incidentally, the chance allusion to albogues havingreminded me of it; and it will be of great assistance to us in the perfectpractice of this calling that I am something of a poet, as thou knowest, andthat besides the bachelor Samson Carrasco is an accomplished one. Of the curateI say nothing; but I will wager he has some spice of the poet in him, and nodoubt Master Nicholas too, for all barbers, or most of them, are guitar playersand stringers of verses. I will bewail my separation; thou shalt glorifythyself as a constant lover; the shepherd Carrascon will figure as a rejectedone, and the curate Curiambro as whatever may please him best; and so all willgo as gaily as heart could wish.&rdquo;</p><p>To this Sancho made answer, &ldquo;I am so unlucky, señor, that I&rsquo;mafraid the day will never come when I&rsquo;ll see myself at such acalling. O what neat spoons I&rsquo;ll make when I&rsquo;m a shepherd!What messes, creams, garlands, pastoral odds and ends! And if they don&rsquo;tget me a name for wisdom, they&rsquo;ll not fail to get me one foringenuity. My daughter Sanchica will bring us our dinner to the pasture.But stay&mdash;she&rsquo;s good-looking, and shepherds there are with moremischief than simplicity in them; I would not have her &lsquo;come forwool and go back shorn;&rsquo; love-making and lawless desires are just ascommon in the fields as in the cities, and in shepherds&rsquo; shanties asin royal palaces; &lsquo;do away with the cause, you do away with the sin;&rsquo;&lsquo;if eyes don&rsquo;t see hearts don&rsquo;t break&rsquo; and &lsquo;bettera clear escape than good men&rsquo;s prayers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A truce to thy proverbs, Sancho,&rdquo; exclaimed Don Quixote;&ldquo;any one of those thou hast uttered would suffice to explain thymeaning; many a time have I recommended thee not to be so lavish withproverbs and to exercise some moderation in delivering them; but it seemsto me it is only &lsquo;preaching in the desert;&rsquo; &lsquo;my motherbeats me and I go on with my tricks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that your worship islike the common saying, &lsquo;Said the frying-pan to the kettle, Getaway, blackbreech.&rsquo; You chide me for uttering proverbs, and youstring them in couples yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Observe, Sancho,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;I bring inproverbs to the purpose, and when I quote them they fit like a ring to thefinger; thou bringest them in by the head and shoulders, in such a waythat thou dost drag them in, rather than introduce them; if I am notmistaken, I have told thee already that proverbs are short maxims drawnfrom the experience and observation of our wise men of old; but theproverb that is not to the purpose is a piece of nonsense and not a maxim.But enough of this; as nightfall is drawing on let us retire some littledistance from the high road to pass the night; what is in store for usto-morrow God knoweth.&rdquo;</p><p>They turned aside, and supped late and poorly, very much against Sancho&rsquo;swill, who turned over in his mind the hardships attendant uponknight-errantry in woods and forests, even though at times plentypresented itself in castles and houses, as at Don Diego de Miranda&rsquo;s,at the wedding of Camacho the Rich, and at Don Antonio Moreno&rsquo;s; hereflected, however, that it could not be always day, nor always night; andso that night he passed in sleeping, and his master in waking.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p67e" id="p67e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p67e.jpg (55K)" src="images/p67e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch68b" id="ch68b"></a>CHAPTER LXVIII.<br/>OF THE BRISTLY ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p68a" id="p68a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p68a.jpg (119K)" src="images/p68a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p68a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The night was somewhat dark, for though there was a moon in the sky it wasnot in a quarter where she could be seen; for sometimes the lady Dianagoes on a stroll to the antipodes, and leaves the mountains all black andthe valleys in darkness. Don Quixote obeyed nature so far as to sleep hisfirst sleep, but did not give way to the second, very different fromSancho, who never had any second, because with him sleep lasted from nighttill morning, wherein he showed what a sound constitution and few cares hehad. Don Quixote&rsquo;s cares kept him restless, so much so that he awokeSancho and said to him, &ldquo;I am amazed, Sancho, at the unconcern ofthy temperament. I believe thou art made of marble or hard brass,incapable of any emotion or feeling whatever. I lie awake while thousleepest, I weep while thou singest, I am faint with fasting while thouart sluggish and torpid from pure repletion. It is the duty of goodservants to share the sufferings and feel the sorrows of their masters, ifit be only for the sake of appearances. See the calmness of the night, thesolitude of the spot, inviting us to break our slumbers by a vigil of somesort. Rise as thou livest, and retire a little distance, and with a goodheart and cheerful courage give thyself three or four hundred lashes onaccount of Dulcinea&rsquo;s disenchantment score; and this I entreat ofthee, making it a request, for I have no desire to come to grips with theea second time, as I know thou hast a heavy hand. As soon as thou hast laidthem on we will pass the rest of the night, I singing my separation, thouthy constancy, making a beginning at once with the pastoral life we are tofollow at our village.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Señor,&rdquo; replied Sancho, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no monk to get upout of the middle of my sleep and scourge myself, nor does it seem to methat one can pass from one extreme of the pain of whipping to the other ofmusic. Will your worship let me sleep, and not worry me about whippingmyself? or you&rsquo;ll make me swear never to touch a hair of my doublet,not to say my flesh.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O hard heart!&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;O pitiless squire! Obread ill-bestowed and favours ill-acknowledged, both those I have donethee and those I mean to do thee! Through me hast thou seen thyself agovernor, and through me thou seest thyself in immediate expectation ofbeing a count, or obtaining some other equivalent title, for I&mdash;<i>posttenebras spero lucem</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;all Iknow is that so long as I am asleep I have neither fear nor hope, troublenor glory; and good luck betide him that invented sleep, the cloak thatcovers over all a man&rsquo;s thoughts, the food that removes hunger, thedrink that drives away thirst, the fire that warms the cold, the cold thattempers the heat, and, to wind up with, the universal coin wherewitheverything is bought, the weight and balance that makes the shepherd equalwith the king and the fool with the wise man. Sleep, I have heard say, hasonly one fault, that it is like death; for between a sleeping man and adead man there is very little difference.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never have I heard thee speak so elegantly as now, Sancho,&rdquo;said Don Quixote; &ldquo;and here I begin to see the truth of the proverbthou dost sometimes quote, &lsquo;Not with whom thou art bred, but withwhom thou art fed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ha, by my life, master mine,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;it&rsquo;snot I that am stringing proverbs now, for they drop in pairs from yourworship&rsquo;s mouth faster than from mine; only there is this differencebetween mine and yours, that yours are well-timed and mine are untimely;but anyhow, they are all proverbs.&rdquo;</p><p>At this point they became aware of a harsh indistinct noise that seemed tospread through all the valleys around. Don Quixote stood up and laid hishand upon his sword, and Sancho ensconced himself under Dapple and put thebundle of armour on one side of him and the ass&rsquo;s pack-saddle on theother, in fear and trembling as great as Don Quixote&rsquo;s perturbation.Each instant the noise increased and came nearer to the two terrified men,or at least to one, for as to the other, his courage is known to all. Thefact of the matter was that some men were taking above six hundred pigs tosell at a fair, and were on their way with them at that hour, and so greatwas the noise they made and their grunting and blowing, that they deafenedthe ears of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, and they could not make out whatit was. The wide-spread grunting drove came on in a surging mass, andwithout showing any respect for Don Quixote&rsquo;s dignity or Sancho&rsquo;s,passed right over the pair of them, demolishing Sancho&rsquo;sentrenchments, and not only upsetting Don Quixote but sweeping Rocinanteoff his feet into the bargain; and what with the trampling and thegrunting, and the pace at which the unclean beasts went, pack-saddle,armour, Dapple and Rocinante were left scattered on the ground and Sanchoand Don Quixote at their wits&rsquo; end.</p><p>Sancho got up as well as he could and begged his master to give him hissword, saying he wanted to kill half a dozen of those dirty unmannerlypigs, for he had by this time found out that that was what they were.</p><p>&ldquo;Let them be, my friend,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;this insultis the penalty of my sin; and it is the righteous chastisement of heaventhat jackals should devour a vanquished knight, and wasps sting him andpigs trample him under foot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I suppose it is the chastisement of heaven, too,&rdquo; saidSancho, &ldquo;that flies should prick the squires of vanquished knights,and lice eat them, and hunger assail them. If we squires were the sons ofthe knights we serve, or their very near relations, it would be no wonderif the penalty of their misdeeds overtook us, even to the fourthgeneration. But what have the Panzas to do with the Quixotes? Well, well,let&rsquo;s lie down again and sleep out what little of the night there&rsquo;sleft, and God will send us dawn and we shall be all right.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p68b" id="p68b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p68b.jpg (345K)" src="images/p68b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p68b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Sleep thou, Sancho,&rdquo; returned Don Quixote, &ldquo;for thouwast born to sleep as I was born to watch; and during the time it nowwants of dawn I will give a loose rein to my thoughts, and seek a vent forthem in a little madrigal which, unknown to thee, I composed in my headlast night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that the thoughts thatallow one to make verses cannot be of great consequence; let your worshipstring verses as much as you like and I&rsquo;ll sleep as much as I can;&rdquo;and forthwith, taking the space of ground he required, he muffled himselfup and fell into a sound sleep, undisturbed by bond, debt, or trouble ofany sort. Don Quixote, propped up against the trunk of a beech or a corktree&mdash;for Cide Hamete does not specify what kind of tree it was&mdash;sangin this strain to the accompaniment of his own sighs:</p><p class="poem">When in my mind<br/>I muse, O Love, upon thy cruelty,<br/>To death I flee,<br/>In hope therein the end of all to find.<br/><br/>But drawing near<br/>That welcome haven in my sea of woe,<br/>Such joy I know,<br/>That life revives, and still I linger here.<br/><br/>Thus life doth slay,<br/>And death again to life restoreth me;<br/>Strange destiny,<br/>That deals with life and death as with a play!<br/></p><p>He accompanied each verse with many sighs and not a few tears, just likeone whose heart was pierced with grief at his defeat and his separationfrom Dulcinea.</p><p>And now daylight came, and the sun smote Sancho on the eyes with hisbeams. He awoke, roused himself up, shook himself and stretched his lazylimbs, and seeing the havoc the pigs had made with his stores he cursedthe drove, and more besides. Then the pair resumed their journey, and asevening closed in they saw coming towards them some ten men on horsebackand four or five on foot. Don Quixote&rsquo;s heart beat quick and Sancho&rsquo;squailed with fear, for the persons approaching them carried lances andbucklers, and were in very warlike guise. Don Quixote turned to Sancho andsaid, &ldquo;If I could make use of my weapons, and my promise had nottied my hands, I would count this host that comes against us but cakes andfancy bread; but perhaps it may prove something different from what weapprehend.&rdquo; The men on horseback now came up, and raising theirlances surrounded Don Quixote in silence, and pointed them at his back andbreast, menacing him with death. One of those on foot, putting his fingerto his lips as a sign to him to be silent, seized Rocinante&rsquo;s bridleand drew him out of the road, and the others driving Sancho and Dapplebefore them, and all maintaining a strange silence, followed in the stepsof the one who led Don Quixote. The latter two or three times attempted toask where they were taking him to and what they wanted, but the instant hebegan to open his lips they threatened to close them with the points oftheir lances; and Sancho fared the same way, for the moment he seemedabout to speak one of those on foot punched him with a goad, and Dapplelikewise, as if he too wanted to talk. Night set in, they quickened theirpace, and the fears of the two prisoners grew greater, especially as theyheard themselves assailed with&mdash;&ldquo;Get on, ye Troglodytes;&rdquo;&ldquo;Silence, ye barbarians;&rdquo; &ldquo;March, ye cannibals;&rdquo;&ldquo;No murmuring, ye Scythians;&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t open youreyes, ye murderous Polyphemes, ye blood-thirsty lions,&rdquo; and suchlikenames with which their captors harassed the ears of the wretched masterand man. Sancho went along saying to himself, &ldquo;We, tortolites,barbers, animals! I don&rsquo;t like those names at all; &lsquo;it&rsquo;sin a bad wind our corn is being winnowed;&rsquo; &lsquo;misfortune comesupon us all at once like sticks on a dog,&rsquo; and God grant it may beno worse than them that this unlucky adventure has in store for us.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote rode completely dazed, unable with the aid of all his wits tomake out what could be the meaning of these abusive names they calledthem, and the only conclusion he could arrive at was that there was nogood to be hoped for and much evil to be feared. And now, about an hourafter midnight, they reached a castle which Don Quixote saw at once wasthe duke&rsquo;s, where they had been but a short time before. &ldquo;Godbless me!&rdquo; said he, as he recognised the mansion, &ldquo;what doesthis mean? It is all courtesy and politeness in this house; but with thevanquished good turns into evil, and evil into worse.&rdquo;</p><p>They entered the chief court of the castle and found it prepared andfitted up in a style that added to their amazement and doubled theirfears, as will be seen in the following chapter.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p68e" id="p68e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p68e.jpg (49K)" src="images/p68e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch69b" id="ch69b"></a>CHAPTER LXIX.<br/>OF THE STRANGEST AND MOST EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTEIN THE WHOLE COURSE OF THIS GREAT HISTORY</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p69a" id="p69a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p69a.jpg (141K)" src="images/p69a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p69a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The horsemen dismounted, and, together with the men on foot, without amoment&rsquo;s delay taking up Sancho and Don Quixote bodily, they carriedthem into the court, all round which near a hundred torches fixed insockets were burning, besides above five hundred lamps in the corridors,so that in spite of the night, which was somewhat dark, the want ofdaylight could not be perceived. In the middle of the court was acatafalque, raised about two yards above the ground and covered completelyby an immense canopy of black velvet, and on the steps all round it whitewax tapers burned in more than a hundred silver candlesticks. Upon thecatafalque was seen the dead body of a damsel so lovely that by her beautyshe made death itself look beautiful. She lay with her head resting upon acushion of brocade and crowned with a garland of sweet-smelling flowers ofdivers sorts, her hands crossed upon her bosom, and between them a branchof yellow palm of victory. On one side of the court was erected a stage,where upon two chairs were seated two persons who from having crowns ontheir heads and sceptres in their hands appeared to be kings of some sort,whether real or mock ones. By the side of this stage, which was reached bysteps, were two other chairs on which the men carrying the prisonersseated Don Quixote and Sancho, all in silence, and by signs giving them tounderstand that they too were to be silent; which, however, they wouldhave been without any signs, for their amazement at all they saw held themtongue-tied. And now two persons of distinction, who were at oncerecognised by Don Quixote as his hosts the duke and duchess, ascended thestage attended by a numerous suite, and seated themselves on two gorgeouschairs close to the two kings, as they seemed to be. Who would not havebeen amazed at this? Nor was this all, for Don Quixote had perceived thatthe dead body on the catafalque was that of the fair Altisidora. As theduke and duchess mounted the stage Don Quixote and Sancho rose and madethem a profound obeisance, which they returned by bowing their headsslightly. At this moment an official crossed over, and approaching Sanchothrew over him a robe of black buckram painted all over with flames offire, and taking off his cap put upon his head a mitre such as thoseundergoing the sentence of the Holy Office wear; and whispered in his earthat he must not open his lips, or they would put a gag upon him, or takehis life. Sancho surveyed himself from head to foot and saw himself allablaze with flames; but as they did not burn him, he did not care twofarthings for them. He took off the mitre and seeing it painted withdevils he put it on again, saying to himself, &ldquo;Well, so far thosedon&rsquo;t burn me nor do these carry me off.&rdquo; Don Quixote surveyedhim too, and though fear had got the better of his faculties, he could nothelp smiling to see the figure Sancho presented. And now from underneaththe catafalque, so it seemed, there rose a low sweet sound of flutes,which, coming unbroken by human voice (for there silence itself keptsilence), had a soft and languishing effect. Then, beside the pillow ofwhat seemed to be the dead body, suddenly appeared a fair youth in a Romanhabit, who, to the accompaniment of a harp which he himself played, sangin a sweet and clear voice these two stanzas:</p><p class="poem">While fair Altisidora, who the sport<br/>    Of cold Don Quixote&rsquo;s cruelty hath been,<br/>Returns to life, and in this magic court<br/>    The dames in sables come to grace the scene,<br/>And while her matrons all in seemly sort<br/>    My lady robes in baize and bombazine,<br/>Her beauty and her sorrows will I sing<br/>With defter quill than touched the Thracian string.<br/><br/>But not in life alone, methinks, to me<br/>    Belongs the office; Lady, when my tongue<br/>Is cold in death, believe me, unto thee<br/>    My voice shall raise its tributary song.<br/>My soul, from this strait prison-house set free,<br/>    As o&rsquo;er the Stygian lake it floats along,<br/>Thy praises singing still shall hold its way,<br/>And make the waters of oblivion stay.<br/></p><p>At this point one of the two that looked like kings exclaimed, &ldquo;Enough,enough, divine singer! It would be an endless task to put before us nowthe death and the charms of the peerless Altisidora, not dead as theignorant world imagines, but living in the voice of fame and in thepenance which Sancho Panza, here present, has to undergo to restore her tothe long-lost light. Do thou, therefore, O Rhadamanthus, who sittest injudgment with me in the murky caverns of Dis, as thou knowest all that theinscrutable fates have decreed touching the resuscitation of this damsel,announce and declare it at once, that the happiness we look forward tofrom her restoration be no longer deferred.&rdquo;</p><p>No sooner had Minos the fellow judge of Rhadamanthus said this, thanRhadamanthus rising up said:</p><p>&ldquo;Ho, officials of this house, high and low, great and small, makehaste hither one and all, and print on Sancho&rsquo;s face four-and-twentysmacks, and give him twelve pinches and six pin thrusts in the back andarms; for upon this ceremony depends the restoration of Altisidora.&rdquo;</p><p>On hearing this Sancho broke silence and cried out, &ldquo;By all that&rsquo;sgood, I&rsquo;ll as soon let my face be smacked or handled as turn Moor. Bodyo&rsquo; me! What has handling my face got to do with the resurrection of thisdamsel? &lsquo;The old woman took kindly to the blits;&rsquo; they enchantDulcinea, and whip me in order to disenchant her; Altisidora dies of ailmentsGod was pleased to send her, and to bring her to life again they must give mefour-and-twenty smacks, and prick holes in my body with pins, and raise wealson my arms with pinches! Try those jokes on a brother-in-law; &lsquo;I&rsquo;man old dog, and &ldquo;tus, tus&rdquo; is no use with me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou shalt die,&rdquo; said Rhadamanthus in a loud voice; &ldquo;relent,thou tiger; humble thyself, proud Nimrod; suffer and he silent, for noimpossibilities are asked of thee; it is not for thee to inquire into thedifficulties in this matter; smacked thou must be, pricked thou shalt seethyself, and with pinches thou must be made to howl. Ho, I say, officials,obey my orders; or by the word of an honest man, ye shall see what ye wereborn for.&rdquo;</p><p>At this some six duennas, advancing across the court, made theirappearance in procession, one after the other, four of them withspectacles, and all with their right hands uplifted, showing four fingersof wrist to make their hands look longer, as is the fashion now-a-days. Nosooner had Sancho caught sight of them than, bellowing like a bull, heexclaimed, &ldquo;I might let myself be handled by all the world; butallow duennas to touch me&mdash;not a bit of it! Scratch my face, as mymaster was served in this very castle; run me through the body withburnished daggers; pinch my arms with red-hot pincers; I&rsquo;ll bear allin patience to serve these gentlefolk; but I won&rsquo;t let duennas touchme, though the devil should carry me off!&rdquo;</p><p>Here Don Quixote, too, broke silence, saying to Sancho, &ldquo;Havepatience, my son, and gratify these noble persons, and give all thanks toheaven that it has infused such virtue into thy person, that by itssufferings thou canst disenchant the enchanted and restore to life thedead.&rdquo;</p><p>The duennas were now close to Sancho, and he, having become more tractableand reasonable, settling himself well in his chair presented his face andbeard to the first, who delivered him a smack very stoutly laid on, andthen made him a low curtsey.</p><p>&ldquo;Less politeness and less paint, señora duenna,&rdquo; said Sancho;&ldquo;by God your hands smell of vinegar-wash.&rdquo;</p><p>In line, all the duennas smacked him and several others of the householdpinched him; but what he could not stand was being pricked by the pins;and so, apparently out of patience, he started up out of his chair, andseizing a lighted torch that stood near him fell upon the duennas and thewhole set of his tormentors, exclaiming, &ldquo;Begone, ye ministers ofhell; I&rsquo;m not made of brass not to feel such out-of-the-waytortures.&rdquo;</p><p>At this instant Altisidora, who probably was tired of having been so longlying on her back, turned on her side; seeing which the bystanders criedout almost with one voice, &ldquo;Altisidora is alive! Altisidora lives!&rdquo;</p><p>Rhadamanthus bade Sancho put away his wrath, as the object they had inview was now attained. When Don Quixote saw Altisidora move, he went onhis knees to Sancho saying to him, &ldquo;Now is the time, son of mybowels, not to call thee my squire, for thee to give thyself some of thoselashes thou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment of Dulcinea. Now, Isay, is the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe, and endowed withefficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee.&rdquo;</p><p>To which Sancho made answer, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s trick upon trick, Ithink, and not honey upon pancakes; a nice thing it would be for awhipping to come now, on the top of pinches, smacks, and pin-proddings!You had better take a big stone and tie it round my neck, and pitch meinto a well; I should not mind it much, if I&rsquo;m to be always made thecow of the wedding for the cure of other people&rsquo;s ailments. Leave mealone; or else by God I&rsquo;ll fling the whole thing to the dogs, letcome what may.&rdquo;</p><p>Altisidora had by this time sat up on the catafalque, and as she did sothe clarions sounded, accompanied by the flutes, and the voices of allpresent exclaiming, &ldquo;Long life to Altisidora! long life toAltisidora!&rdquo; The duke and duchess and the kings Minos andRhadamanthus stood up, and all, together with Don Quixote and Sancho,advanced to receive her and take her down from the catafalque; and she,making as though she were recovering from a swoon, bowed her head to theduke and duchess and to the kings, and looking sideways at Don Quixote,said to him, &ldquo;God forgive thee, insensible knight, for through thycruelty I have been, to me it seems, more than a thousand years in theother world; and to thee, the most compassionate upon earth, I renderthanks for the life I am now in possession of. From this day forth, friendSancho, count as thine six smocks of mine which I bestow upon thee, tomake as many shirts for thyself, and if they are not all quite whole, atany rate they are all clean.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho kissed her hands in gratitude, kneeling, and with the mitre in hishand. The duke bade them take it from him, and give him back his cap anddoublet and remove the flaming robe. Sancho begged the duke to let themleave him the robe and mitre; as he wanted to take them home for a tokenand memento of that unexampled adventure. The duchess said they must leavethem with him; for he knew already what a great friend of his she was. Theduke then gave orders that the court should be cleared, and that allshould retire to their chambers, and that Don Quixote and Sancho should beconducted to their old quarters.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p69e" id="p69e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p69e.jpg (60K)" src="images/p69e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch70b" id="ch70b"></a>CHAPTER LXX.<br/>WHICH FOLLOWS SIXTY-NINE AND DEALS WITH MATTERS INDISPENSABLE FOR THECLEAR COMPREHENSION OF THIS HISTORY</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p70a" id="p70a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p70a.jpg (131K)" src="images/p70a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p70a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Sancho slept that night in a cot in the same chamber with Don Quixote, athing he would have gladly excused if he could for he knew very well thatwith questions and answers his master would not let him sleep, and he wasin no humour for talking much, as he still felt the pain of his latemartyrdom, which interfered with his freedom of speech; and it would havebeen more to his taste to sleep in a hovel alone, than in that luxuriouschamber in company. And so well founded did his apprehension prove, and socorrect was his anticipation, that scarcely had his master got into bedwhen he said, &ldquo;What dost thou think of to-night&rsquo;s adventure,Sancho? Great and mighty is the power of cold-hearted scorn, for thou withthine own eyes hast seen Altisidora slain, not by arrows, nor by thesword, nor by any warlike weapon, nor by deadly poisons, but by thethought of the sternness and scorn with which I have always treated her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She might have died and welcome,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;whenshe pleased and how she pleased; and she might have left me alone, for Inever made her fall in love or scorned her. I don&rsquo;t know nor can Iimagine how the recovery of Altisidora, a damsel more fanciful than wise,can have, as I have said before, anything to do with the sufferings ofSancho Panza. Now I begin to see plainly and clearly that there areenchanters and enchanted people in the world; and may God deliver me fromthem, since I can&rsquo;t deliver myself; and so I beg of your worship tolet me sleep and not ask me any more questions, unless you want me tothrow myself out of the window.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sleep, Sancho my friend,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;if thepinprodding and pinches thou hast received and the smacks administered tothee will let thee.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No pain came up to the insult of the smacks,&rdquo; said Sancho,&ldquo;for the simple reason that it was duennas, confound them, that gavethem to me; but once more I entreat your worship to let me sleep, forsleep is relief from misery to those who are miserable when awake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be it so, and God be with thee,&rdquo; said Don Quixote.</p><p>They fell asleep, both of them, and Cide Hamete, the author of this greathistory, took this opportunity to record and relate what it was thatinduced the duke and duchess to get up the elaborate plot that has beendescribed. The bachelor Samson Carrasco, he says, not forgetting how he asthe Knight of the Mirrors had been vanquished and overthrown by DonQuixote, which defeat and overthrow upset all his plans, resolved to tryhis hand again, hoping for better luck than he had before; and so, havinglearned where Don Quixote was from the page who brought the letter andpresent to Sancho&rsquo;s wife, Teresa Panza, he got himself new armourand another horse, and put a white moon upon his shield, and to carry hisarms he had a mule led by a peasant, not by Tom Cecial his former squirefor fear he should be recognised by Sancho or Don Quixote. He came to theduke&rsquo;s castle, and the duke informed him of the road and route DonQuixote had taken with the intention of being present at the jousts atSaragossa. He told him, too, of the jokes he had practised upon him, andof the device for the disenchantment of Dulcinea at the expense of Sancho&rsquo;sbackside; and finally he gave him an account of the trick Sancho hadplayed upon his master, making him believe that Dulcinea was enchanted andturned into a country wench; and of how the duchess, his wife, hadpersuaded Sancho that it was he himself who was deceived, inasmuch asDulcinea was really enchanted; at which the bachelor laughed not a little,and marvelled as well at the sharpness and simplicity of Sancho as at thelength to which Don Quixote&rsquo;s madness went. The duke begged of himif he found him (whether he overcame him or not) to return that way andlet him know the result. This the bachelor did; he set out in quest of DonQuixote, and not finding him at Saragossa, he went on, and how he faredhas been already told. He returned to the duke&rsquo;s castle and told himall, what the conditions of the combat were, and how Don Quixote was now,like a loyal knight-errant, returning to keep his promise of retiring tohis village for a year, by which time, said the bachelor, he might perhapsbe cured of his madness; for that was the object that had led him to adoptthese disguises, as it was a sad thing for a gentleman of such good partsas Don Quixote to be a madman. And so he took his leave of the duke, andwent home to his village to wait there for Don Quixote, who was comingafter him. Thereupon the duke seized the opportunity of practising thismystification upon him; so much did he enjoy everything connected withSancho and Don Quixote. He had the roads about the castle far and near,everywhere he thought Don Quixote was likely to pass on his return,occupied by large numbers of his servants on foot and on horseback, whowere to bring him to the castle, by fair means or foul, if they met him.They did meet him, and sent word to the duke, who, having already settledwhat was to be done, as soon as he heard of his arrival, ordered thetorches and lamps in the court to be lit and Altisidora to be placed onthe catafalque with all the pomp and ceremony that has been described, thewhole affair being so well arranged and acted that it differed but littlefrom reality. And Cide Hamete says, moreover, that for his part heconsiders the concocters of the joke as crazy as the victims of it, andthat the duke and duchess were not two fingers&rsquo; breadth removed frombeing something like fools themselves when they took such pains to makegame of a pair of fools.</p><p>As for the latter, one was sleeping soundly and the other lying awakeoccupied with his desultory thoughts, when daylight came to them bringingwith it the desire to rise; for the lazy down was never a delight to DonQuixote, victor or vanquished. Altisidora, come back from death to life asDon Quixote fancied, following up the freak of her lord and lady, enteredthe chamber, crowned with the garland she had worn on the catafalque andin a robe of white taffeta embroidered with gold flowers, her hair flowingloose over her shoulders, and leaning upon a staff of fine black ebony.Don Quixote, disconcerted and in confusion at her appearance, huddledhimself up and well-nigh covered himself altogether with the sheets andcounterpane of the bed, tongue-tied, and unable to offer her any civility.Altisidora seated herself on a chair at the head of the bed, and, after adeep sigh, said to him in a feeble, soft voice, &ldquo;When women of rankand modest maidens trample honour under foot, and give a loose to thetongue that breaks through every impediment, publishing abroad the inmostsecrets of their hearts, they are reduced to sore extremities. Such a oneam I, Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, crushed, conquered, love-smitten,but yet patient under suffering and virtuous, and so much so that my heartbroke with grief and I lost my life. For the last two days I have beendead, slain by the thought of the cruelty with which thou hast treated me,obdurate knight,</p><p class="poem">O harder thou than marble to my plaint;</p><p class="noindent">or at least believed to be dead by all who saw me; and had it not beenthat Love, taking pity on me, let my recovery rest upon the sufferings ofthis good squire, there I should have remained in the other world.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Love might very well have let it rest upon the sufferings of myass, and I should have been obliged to him,&rdquo; said Sancho. &ldquo;Buttell me, señora&mdash;and may heaven send you a tenderer lover than mymaster&mdash;what did you see in the other world? What goes on in hell?For of course that&rsquo;s where one who dies in despair is bound for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; said Altisidora, &ldquo;I cannot havedied outright, for I did not go into hell; had I gone in, it is verycertain I should never have come out again, do what I might. The truth is,I came to the gate, where some dozen or so of devils were playing tennis,all in breeches and doublets, with falling collars trimmed with Flemishbonelace, and ruffles of the same that served them for wristbands, withfour fingers&rsquo; breadth of the arms exposed to make their hands looklonger; in their hands they held rackets of fire; but what amazed me stillmore was that books, apparently full of wind and rubbish, served them fortennis balls, a strange and marvellous thing; this, however, did notastonish me so much as to observe that, although with players it is usualfor the winners to be glad and the losers sorry, there in that game allwere growling, all were snarling, and all were cursing one another.&rdquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no wonder,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;for devils,whether playing or not, can never be content, win or lose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Altisidora; &ldquo;but there is anotherthing that surprises me too, I mean surprised me then, and that was thatno ball outlasted the first throw or was of any use a second time; and itwas wonderful the constant succession there was of books, new and old. Toone of them, a brand-new, well-bound one, they gave such a stroke thatthey knocked the guts out of it and scattered the leaves about. &lsquo;Lookwhat book that is,&rsquo; said one devil to another, and the otherreplied, &lsquo;It is the &ldquo;Second Part of the History of Don Quixoteof La Mancha,&rdquo; not by Cide Hamete, the original author, but by anAragonese who by his own account is of Tordesillas.&rsquo; &lsquo;Out ofthis with it,&rsquo; said the first, &lsquo;and into the depths of hellwith it out of my sight.&rsquo; &lsquo;Is it so bad?&rsquo; said theother. &lsquo;So bad is it,&rsquo; said the first, &lsquo;that if I hadset myself deliberately to make a worse, I could not have done it.&rsquo;They then went on with their game, knocking other books about; and I,having heard them mention the name of Don Quixote whom I love and adoreso, took care to retain this vision in my memory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A vision it must have been, no doubt,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;for there is no other I in the world; this history has been goingabout here for some time from hand to hand, but it does not stay long inany, for everybody gives it a taste of his foot. I am not disturbed byhearing that I am wandering in a fantastic shape in the darkness of thepit or in the daylight above, for I am not the one that history treats of.If it should be good, faithful, and true, it will have ages of life; butif it should be bad, from its birth to its burial will not be a very longjourney.&rdquo;</p><p>Altisidora was about to proceed with her complaint against Don Quixote, when hesaid to her, &ldquo;I have several times told you, señora, that it grieves meyou should have set your affections upon me, as from mine they can only receivegratitude, but no return. I was born to belong to Dulcinea del Toboso, and thefates, if there are any, dedicated me to her; and to suppose that any otherbeauty can take the place she occupies in my heart is to suppose animpossibility. This frank declaration should suffice to make you retire withinthe bounds of your modesty, for no one can bind himself to doimpossibilities.&rdquo;</p><p>Hearing this, Altisidora, with a show of anger and agitation, exclaimed,&ldquo;God&rsquo;s life! Don Stockfish, soul of a mortar, stone of a date,more obstinate and obdurate than a clown asked a favour when he has hismind made up, if I fall upon you I&rsquo;ll tear your eyes out! Do youfancy, Don Vanquished, Don Cudgelled, that I died for your sake? All thatyou have seen to-night has been make-believe; I&rsquo;m not the woman tolet the black of my nail suffer for such a camel, much less die!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I can well believe,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;for all thatabout lovers pining to death is absurd; they may talk of it, but as fordoing it&mdash;Judas may believe that!&rdquo;</p><p>While they were talking, the musician, singer, and poet, who had sung thetwo stanzas given above came in, and making a profound obeisance to DonQuixote said, &ldquo;Will your worship, sir knight, reckon and retain mein the number of your most faithful servants, for I have long been a greatadmirer of yours, as well because of your fame as because of yourachievements?&rdquo; &ldquo;Will your worship tell me who you are,&rdquo;replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;so that my courtesy may be answerable to yourdeserts?&rdquo; The young man replied that he was the musician andsongster of the night before. &ldquo;Of a truth,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;your worship has a most excellent voice; but what you sang did notseem to me very much to the purpose; for what have Garcilasso&rsquo;sstanzas to do with the death of this lady?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be surprised at that,&rdquo; returned the musician;&ldquo;for with the callow poets of our day the way is for every one towrite as he pleases and pilfer where he chooses, whether it be germane tothe matter or not, and now-a-days there is no piece of silliness they cansing or write that is not set down to poetic licence.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote was about to reply, but was prevented by the duke and duchess,who came in to see him, and with them there followed a long and delightfulconversation, in the course of which Sancho said so many droll and saucythings that he left the duke and duchess wondering not only at hissimplicity but at his sharpness. Don Quixote begged their permission totake his departure that same day, inasmuch as for a vanquished knight likehimself it was fitter he should live in a pig-sty than in a royal palace.They gave it very readily, and the duchess asked him if Altisidora was inhis good graces.</p><p>He replied, &ldquo;Señora, let me tell your ladyship that this damsel&rsquo;sailment comes entirely of idleness, and the cure for it is honest andconstant employment. She herself has told me that lace is worn in hell;and as she must know how to make it, let it never be out of her hands; forwhen she is occupied in shifting the bobbins to and fro, the image orimages of what she loves will not shift to and fro in her thoughts; thisis the truth, this is my opinion, and this is my advice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; added Sancho; &ldquo;for I never in all my lifesaw a lace-maker that died for love; when damsels are at work their mindsare more set on finishing their tasks than on thinking of their loves. Ispeak from my own experience; for when I&rsquo;m digging I never think ofmy old woman; I mean my Teresa Panza, whom I love better than my owneyelids.&rdquo; &ldquo;You say well, Sancho,&rdquo; said the duchess,&ldquo;and I will take care that my Altisidora employs herselfhenceforward in needlework of some sort; for she is extremely expert atit.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no occasion to have recourse to that remedy,señora,&rdquo; said Altisidora; &ldquo;for the mere thought of the crueltywith which this vagabond villain has treated me will suffice to blot himout of my memory without any other device; with your highness&rsquo;sleave I will retire, not to have before my eyes, I won&rsquo;t say hisrueful countenance, but his abominable, ugly looks.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thatreminds me of the common saying, that &lsquo;he that rails is ready toforgive,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the duke.</p><p>Altisidora then, pretending to wipe away her tears with a handkerchief,made an obeisance to her master and mistress and quitted the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Ill luck betide thee, poor damsel,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;illluck betide thee! Thou hast fallen in with a soul as dry as a rush and aheart as hard as oak; had it been me, i&rsquo;faith &lsquo;another cockwould have crowed to thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>So the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote dressed himself anddined with the duke and duchess, and set out the same evening.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p70e" id="p70e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p70e.jpg (73K)" src="images/p70e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p70e.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch71b" id="ch71b"></a>CHAPTER LXXI.<br/>OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE SANCHO ON THE WAY TOTHEIR VILLAGE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p71a" id="p71a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p71a.jpg (82K)" src="images/p71a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p71a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>The vanquished and afflicted Don Quixote went along very downcast in onerespect and very happy in another. His sadness arose from his defeat, andhis satisfaction from the thought of the virtue that lay in Sancho, as hadbeen proved by the resurrection of Altisidora; though it was withdifficulty he could persuade himself that the love-smitten damsel had beenreally dead. Sancho went along anything but cheerful, for it grieved himthat Altisidora had not kept her promise of giving him the smocks; andturning this over in his mind he said to his master, &ldquo;Surely, señor,I&rsquo;m the most unlucky doctor in the world; there&rsquo;s many aphysician that, after killing the sick man he had to cure, requires to bepaid for his work, though it is only signing a bit of a list of medicines,that the apothecary and not he makes up, and, there, his labour is over;but with me though to cure somebody else costs me drops of blood, smacks,pinches, pinproddings, and whippings, nobody gives me a farthing. Well, Iswear by all that&rsquo;s good if they put another patient into my hands,they&rsquo;ll have to grease them for me before I cure him; for, as theysay, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s by his singing the abbot gets his dinner,&rsquo;and I&rsquo;m not going to believe that heaven has bestowed upon me thevirtue I have, that I should be dealing it out to others all for nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art right, Sancho my friend,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;andAltisidora has behaved very badly in not giving thee the smocks shepromised; and although that virtue of thine is <i>gratis data</i>&mdash;as it hascost thee no study whatever, any more than such study as thy personalsufferings may be&mdash;I can say for myself that if thou wouldst havepayment for the lashes on account of the disenchant of Dulcinea, I wouldhave given it to thee freely ere this. I am not sure, however, whetherpayment will comport with the cure, and I would not have the rewardinterfere with the medicine. I think there will be nothing lost by tryingit; consider how much thou wouldst have, Sancho, and whip thyself at once,and pay thyself down with thine own hand, as thou hast money of mine.&rdquo;</p><p>At this proposal Sancho opened his eyes and his ears a palm&rsquo;sbreadth wide, and in his heart very readily acquiesced in whippinghimself, and said he to his master, &ldquo;Very well then, señor, I&rsquo;llhold myself in readiness to gratify your worship&rsquo;s wishes if I&rsquo;mto profit by it; for the love of my wife and children forces me to seemgrasping. Let your worship say how much you will pay me for each lash Igive myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If Sancho,&rdquo; replied Don Quixote, &ldquo;I were to requitethee as the importance and nature of the cure deserves, the treasures ofVenice, the mines of Potosi, would be insufficient to pay thee. See whatthou hast of mine, and put a price on each lash.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of them,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;there are three thousand threehundred and odd; of these I have given myself five, the rest remain; letthe five go for the odd ones, and let us take the three thousand threehundred, which at a quarter real apiece (for I will not take less thoughthe whole world should bid me) make three thousand three hundred quarterreals; the three thousand are one thousand five hundred half reals, whichmake seven hundred and fifty reals; and the three hundred make a hundredand fifty half reals, which come to seventy-five reals, which added to theseven hundred and fifty make eight hundred and twenty-five reals in all.These I will stop out of what I have belonging to your worship, and I&rsquo;llreturn home rich and content, though well whipped, for &lsquo;there&rsquo;sno taking trout&rsquo;&mdash;but I say no more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O blessed Sancho! O dear Sancho!&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;howwe shall be bound to serve thee, Dulcinea and I, all the days of our livesthat heaven may grant us! If she returns to her lost shape (and it cannotbe but that she will) her misfortune will have been good fortune, and mydefeat a most happy triumph. But look here, Sancho; when wilt thou beginthe scourging? For if thou wilt make short work of it, I will give thee ahundred reals over and above.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;this night without fail. Let yourworship order it so that we pass it out of doors and in the open air, andI&rsquo;ll scarify myself.&rdquo;</p><p>Night, longed for by Don Quixote with the greatest anxiety in the world,came at last, though it seemed to him that the wheels of Apollo&rsquo;scar had broken down, and that the day was drawing itself out longer thanusual, just as is the case with lovers, who never make the reckoning oftheir desires agree with time. They made their way at length in among somepleasant trees that stood a little distance from the road, and therevacating Rocinante&rsquo;s saddle and Dapple&rsquo;s pack-saddle, theystretched themselves on the green grass and made their supper off Sancho&rsquo;sstores, and he making a powerful and flexible whip out of Dapple&rsquo;shalter and headstall retreated about twenty paces from his master amongsome beech trees. Don Quixote seeing him march off with such resolutionand spirit, said to him, &ldquo;Take care, my friend, not to cut thyselfto pieces; allow the lashes to wait for one another, and do not be in sogreat a hurry as to run thyself out of breath midway; I mean, do not layon so strenuously as to make thy life fail thee before thou hast reachedthe desired number; and that thou mayest not lose by a card too much ortoo little, I will station myself apart and count on my rosary here thelashes thou givest thyself. May heaven help thee as thy good intentiondeserves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pledges don&rsquo;t distress a good payer,&rsquo;&rdquo;said Sancho; &ldquo;I mean to lay on in such a way as without killingmyself to hurt myself, for in that, no doubt, lies the essence of thismiracle.&rdquo;</p><p>He then stripped himself from the waist upwards, and snatching up the ropehe began to lay on and Don Quixote to count the lashes. He might havegiven himself six or eight when he began to think the joke no trifle, andits price very low; and holding his hand for a moment, he told his masterthat he cried off on the score of a blind bargain, for each of thoselashes ought to be paid for at the rate of half a real instead of aquarter.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on, Sancho my friend, and be not disheartened,&rdquo; said DonQuixote; &ldquo;for I double the stakes as to price.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;in God&rsquo;s hand be it,and let it rain lashes.&rdquo; But the rogue no longer laid them on hisshoulders, but laid on to the trees, with such groans every now and then,that one would have thought at each of them his soul was being plucked upby the roots. Don Quixote, touched to the heart, and fearing he might makean end of himself, and that through Sancho&rsquo;s imprudence he mightmiss his own object, said to him, &ldquo;As thou livest, my friend, letthe matter rest where it is, for the remedy seems to me a very rough one,and it will be well to have patience; &lsquo;Zamora was not won in anhour.&rsquo; If I have not reckoned wrong thou hast given thyself over athousand lashes; that is enough for the present; &lsquo;for the ass,&rsquo;to put it in homely phrase, &lsquo;bears the load, but not the overload.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, no, señor,&rdquo; replied Sancho; &ldquo;it shall never be saidof me, &lsquo;The money paid, the arms broken;&rsquo; go back a littlefurther, your worship, and let me give myself at any rate a thousandlashes more; for in a couple of bouts like this we shall have finished offthe lot, and there will be even cloth to spare.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As thou art in such a willing mood,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;may heaven aid thee; lay on and I&rsquo;ll retire.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho returned to his task with so much resolution that he soon had thebark stripped off several trees, such was the severity with which hewhipped himself; and one time, raising his voice, and giving a beech atremendous lash, he cried out, &ldquo;Here dies Samson, and all with him!&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p71b" id="p71b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p71b.jpg (349K)" src="images/p71b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p71b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>At the sound of his piteous cry and of the stroke of the cruel lash, DonQuixote ran to him at once, and seizing the twisted halter that served himfor a courbash, said to him, &ldquo;Heaven forbid, Sancho my friend, thatto please me thou shouldst lose thy life, which is needed for the supportof thy wife and children; let Dulcinea wait for a better opportunity, andI will content myself with a hope soon to be realised, and have patienceuntil thou hast gained fresh strength so as to finish off this business tothe satisfaction of everybody.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As your worship will have it so, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;sobe it; but throw your cloak over my shoulders, for I&rsquo;m sweating andI don&rsquo;t want to take cold; it&rsquo;s a risk that novicedisciplinants run.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote obeyed, and stripping himself covered Sancho, who slept untilthe sun woke him; they then resumed their journey, which for the timebeing they brought to an end at a village that lay three leagues fartheron. They dismounted at a hostelry which Don Quixote recognised as such anddid not take to be a castle with moat, turrets, portcullis, anddrawbridge; for ever since he had been vanquished he talked morerationally about everything, as will be shown presently. They quarteredhim in a room on the ground floor, where in place of leather hangingsthere were pieces of painted serge such as they commonly use in villages.On one of them was painted by some very poor hand the Rape of Helen, whenthe bold guest carried her off from Menelaus, and on the other was thestory of Dido and Æneas, she on a high tower, as though she were makingsignals with a half sheet to her fugitive guest who was out at sea flyingin a frigate or brigantine. He noticed in the two stories that Helen didnot go very reluctantly, for she was laughing slyly and roguishly; but thefair Dido was shown dropping tears the size of walnuts from her eyes. DonQuixote as he looked at them observed, &ldquo;Those two ladies were veryunfortunate not to have been born in this age, and I unfortunate above allmen not to have been born in theirs. Had I fallen in with those gentlemen,Troy would not have been burned or Carthage destroyed, for it would havebeen only for me to slay Paris, and all these misfortunes would have beenavoided.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay a bet,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;that before longthere won&rsquo;t be a tavern, roadside inn, hostelry, or barber&rsquo;sshop where the story of our doings won&rsquo;t be painted up; but I&rsquo;dlike it painted by the hand of a better painter than painted these.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou art right, Sancho,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;for thispainter is like Orbaneja, a painter there was at Úbeda, who when theyasked him what he was painting, used to say, &lsquo;Whatever it may turnout; and if he chanced to paint a cock he would write under it, &lsquo;Thisis a cock,&rsquo; for fear they might think it was a fox. The painter orwriter, for it&rsquo;s all the same, who published the history of this newDon Quixote that has come out, must have been one of this sort I think,Sancho, for he painted or wrote &lsquo;whatever it might turn out;&rsquo;or perhaps he is like a poet called Mauleon that was about the Court someyears ago, who used to answer at haphazard whatever he was asked, and onone asking him what <i>Deum de Deo</i> meant, he replied <i>Dé donde diere</i>. But,putting this aside, tell me, Sancho, hast thou a mind to have another turnat thyself to-night, and wouldst thou rather have it indoors or in theopen air?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Egad, señor,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;for what I&rsquo;m going togive myself, it comes all the same to me whether it is in a house or inthe fields; still I&rsquo;d like it to be among trees; for I think theyare company for me and help me to bear my pain wonderfully.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And yet it must not be, Sancho my friend,&rdquo; said Don Quixote;&ldquo;but, to enable thee to recover strength, we must keep it for ourown village; for at the latest we shall get there the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho said he might do as he pleased; but that for his own part he wouldlike to finish off the business quickly before his blood cooled and whilehe had an appetite, because &ldquo;in delay there is apt to be danger&rdquo;very often, and &ldquo;praying to God and plying the hammer,&rdquo; and&ldquo;one take was better than two I&rsquo;ll give thee&rsquo;s,&rdquo;and &ldquo;a sparrow in the hand than a vulture on the wing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Sancho, no more proverbs!&rdquo; exclaimedDon Quixote; &ldquo;it seems to me thou art becoming <i>sicut erat</i> again;speak in a plain, simple, straight-forward way, as I have often told thee,and thou wilt find the good of it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what bad luck it is of mine,&rdquo; said Sancho,&ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t utter a word without a proverb that is not asgood as an argument to my mind; however, I mean to mend if I can;&rdquo;and so for the present the conversation ended.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p71e" id="p71e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p71e.jpg (42K)" src="images/p71e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch72b" id="ch72b"></a>CHAPTER LXXII.<br/>OF HOW DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO REACHED THEIR VILLAGE</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p72a" id="p72a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p72a.jpg (155K)" src="images/p72a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p72a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>All that day Don Quixote and Sancho remained in the village and innwaiting for night, the one to finish off his task of scourging in the opencountry, the other to see it accomplished, for therein lay theaccomplishment of his wishes. Meanwhile there arrived at the hostelry atraveller on horseback with three or four servants, one of whom said tohim who appeared to be the master, &ldquo;Here, Señor Don Álvaro Tarfe,your worship may take your siesta to-day; the quarters seem clean andcool.&rdquo;</p><p>When he heard this Don Quixote said to Sancho, &ldquo;Look here, Sancho;on turning over the leaves of that book of the Second Part of my history Ithink I came casually upon this name of Don Álvaro Tarfe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;we had better let himdismount, and by-and-by we can ask about it.&rdquo;</p><p>The gentleman dismounted, and the landlady gave him a room on the groundfloor opposite Don Quixote&rsquo;s and adorned with painted serge hangingsof the same sort. The newly arrived gentleman put on a summer coat, andcoming out to the gateway of the hostelry, which was wide and cool,addressing Don Quixote, who was pacing up and down there, he asked,&ldquo;In what direction is your worship bound, gentle sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To a village near this which is my own village,&rdquo; replied DonQuixote; &ldquo;and your worship, where are you bound for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am going to Granada, señor,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;tomy own country.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And a goodly country,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;but will yourworship do me the favour of telling me your name, for it strikes me it isof more importance to me to know it than I can tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Don Álvaro Tarfe,&rdquo; replied the traveller.</p><p>To which Don Quixote returned, &ldquo;I have no doubt whatever that yourworship is that Don Álvaro Tarfe who appears in print in the Second Partof the history of Don Quixote of La Mancha, lately printed and publishedby a new author.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am the same,&rdquo; replied the gentleman; &ldquo;and that sameDon Quixote, the principal personage in the said history, was a very greatfriend of mine, and it was I who took him away from home, or at leastinduced him to come to some jousts that were to be held at Saragossa,whither I was going myself; indeed, I showed him many kindnesses, andsaved him from having his shoulders touched up by the executioner becauseof his extreme rashness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me, Señor Don Álvaro,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;am I atall like that Don Quixote you talk of?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No indeed,&rdquo; replied the traveller, &ldquo;not a bit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that Don Quixote&mdash;&rdquo; said our one, &ldquo;had he with hima squire called Sancho Panza?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He had,&rdquo; said Don Álvaro; &ldquo;but though he had the nameof being very droll, I never heard him say anything that had any drolleryin it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I can well believe,&rdquo; said Sancho at this, &ldquo;for tocome out with drolleries is not in everybody&rsquo;s line; and that Sanchoyour worship speaks of, gentle sir, must be some great scoundrel,dunderhead, and thief, all in one; for I am the real Sancho Panza, and Ihave more drolleries than if it rained them; let your worship only try;come along with me for a year or so, and you will find they fall from meat every turn, and so rich and so plentiful that though mostly I don&rsquo;tknow what I am saying I make everybody that hears me laugh. And the realDon Quixote of La Mancha, the famous, the valiant, the wise, the lover,the righter of wrongs, the guardian of minors and orphans, the protectorof widows, the killer of damsels, he who has for his sole mistress thepeerless Dulcinea del Toboso, is this gentleman before you, my master; allother Don Quixotes and all other Sancho Panzas are dreams and mockeries.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By God I believe it,&rdquo; said Don Álvaro; &ldquo;for you haveuttered more drolleries, my friend, in the few words you have spoken thanthe other Sancho Panza in all I ever heard from him, and they were not afew. He was more greedy than well-spoken, and more dull than droll; and Iam convinced that the enchanters who persecute Don Quixote the Good havebeen trying to persecute me with Don Quixote the Bad. But I don&rsquo;tknow what to say, for I am ready to swear I left him shut up in the Casadel Nuncio at Toledo, and here another Don Quixote turns up, though a verydifferent one from mine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I am good,&rdquo; said Don Quixote,&ldquo;but I can safely say I am not &lsquo;the Bad;&rsquo; and to proveit, let me tell you, Señor Don Álvaro Tarfe, I have never in my life beenin Saragossa; so far from that, when it was told me that this imaginaryDon Quixote had been present at the jousts in that city, I declined toenter it, in order to drag his falsehood before the face of the world; andso I went on straight to Barcelona, the treasure-house of courtesy, havenof strangers, asylum of the poor, home of the valiant, champion of thewronged, pleasant exchange of firm friendships, and city unrivalled insite and beauty. And though the adventures that befell me there are not byany means matters of enjoyment, but rather of regret, I do not regretthem, simply because I have seen it. In a word, Señor Don Álvaro Tarfe, Iam Don Quixote of La Mancha, the one that fame speaks of, and not theunlucky one that has attempted to usurp my name and deck himself out in myideas. I entreat your worship by your devoir as a gentleman to be so goodas to make a declaration before the alcalde of this village that you neverin all your life saw me until now, and that neither am I the Don Quixotein print in the Second Part, nor this Sancho Panza, my squire, the oneyour worship knew.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I will do most willingly,&rdquo; replied Don Álvaro; &ldquo;thoughit amazes me to find two Don Quixotes and two Sancho Panzas at once, asmuch alike in name as they differ in demeanour; and again I say anddeclare that what I saw I cannot have seen, and that what happened mecannot have happened.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No doubt your worship is enchanted, like my lady Dulcinea delToboso,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;and would to heaven your disenchantmentrested on my giving myself another three thousand and odd lashes like whatI&rsquo;m giving myself for her, for I&rsquo;d lay them on without lookingfor anything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand that about the lashes,&rdquo; said DonÁlvaro. Sancho replied that it was a long story to tell, but he would tellhim if they happened to be going the same road.</p><p>By this dinner-time arrived, and Don Quixote and Don Álvaro dinedtogether. The alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn togetherwith a notary, and Don Quixote laid a petition before him, showing that itwas requisite for his rights that Don Álvaro Tarfe, the gentleman therepresent, should make a declaration before him that he did not know DonQuixote of La Mancha, also there present, and that he was not the one thatwas in print in a history entitled &ldquo;Second Part of Don Quixote of LaMancha, by one Avellaneda of Tordesillas.&rdquo; The alcalde finally putit in legal form, and the declaration was made with all the formalitiesrequired in such cases, at which Don Quixote and Sancho were in highdelight, as if a declaration of the sort was of any great importance tothem, and as if their words and deeds did not plainly show the differencebetween the two Don Quixotes and the two Sanchos. Many civilities andoffers of service were exchanged by Don Álvaro and Don Quixote, in thecourse of which the great Manchegan displayed such good taste that hedisabused Don Álvaro of the error he was under; and he, on his part, feltconvinced he must have been enchanted, now that he had been brought incontact with two such opposite Don Quixotes.</p><p>Evening came, they set out from the village, and after about half a leaguetwo roads branched off, one leading to Don Quixote&rsquo;s village, theother the road Don Álvaro was to follow. In this short interval DonQuixote told him of his unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea&rsquo;senchantment and the remedy, all which threw Don Álvaro into freshamazement, and embracing Don Quixote and Sancho, he went his way, and DonQuixote went his. That night he passed among trees again in order to giveSancho an opportunity of working out his penance, which he did in the samefashion as the night before, at the expense of the bark of the beech treesmuch more than of his back, of which he took such good care that thelashes would not have knocked off a fly had there been one there. Theduped Don Quixote did not miss a single stroke of the count, and he foundthat together with those of the night before they made up three thousandand twenty-nine. The sun apparently had got up early to witness thesacrifice, and with his light they resumed their journey, discussing thedeception practised on Don Álvaro, and saying how well done it was to havetaken his declaration before a magistrate in such an unimpeachable form.That day and night they travelled on, nor did anything worth mentionhappen to them, unless it was that in the course of the night Sanchofinished off his task, whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure joyful. Hewatched for daylight, to see if along the road he should fall in with hisalready disenchanted lady Dulcinea; and as he pursued his journey therewas no woman he met that he did not go up to, to see if she was Dulcineadel Toboso, as he held it absolutely certain that Merlin&rsquo;s promisescould not lie. Full of these thoughts and anxieties, they ascended arising ground wherefrom they descried their own village, at the sight ofwhich Sancho fell on his knees exclaiming, &ldquo;Open thine eyes,longed-for home, and see how thy son Sancho Panza comes back to thee, ifnot very rich, very well whipped! Open thine arms and receive, too, thyson Don Quixote, who, if he comes vanquished by the arm of another, comesvictor over himself, which, as he himself has told me, is the greatestvictory anyone can desire. I&rsquo;m bringing back money, for if I waswell whipped, I went mounted like a gentleman.&rdquo;</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p72b" id="p72b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p72b.jpg (375K)" src="images/p72b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p72b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>&ldquo;Have done with these fooleries,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;letus push on straight and get to our own place, where we will give freerange to our fancies, and settle our plans for our future pastoral life.&rdquo;</p><p>With this they descended the slope and directed their steps to theirvillage.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p72e" id="p72e"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p72e.jpg (35K)" src="images/p72e.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch73b" id="ch73b"></a>CHAPTER LXXIII.<br/>OF THE OMENS DON QUIXOTE HAD AS HE ENTERED HIS OWN VILLAGE, AND OTHERINCIDENTS THAT EMBELLISH AND GIVE A COLOUR TO THIS GREAT HISTORY</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p73a" id="p73a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p73a.jpg (141K)" src="images/p73a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p73a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>At the entrance of the village, so says Cide Hamete, Don Quixote saw twoboys quarrelling on the village threshing-floor, one of whom said to theother, &ldquo;Take it easy, Periquillo; thou shalt never see it again aslong as thou livest.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote heard this, and said he to Sancho, &ldquo;Dost thou not mark,friend, what that boy said, &lsquo;Thou shalt never see it again as longas thou livest&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sancho, &ldquo;what does it matter if the boysaid so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;dost thou not see that,applied to the object of my desires, the words mean that I am never to seeDulcinea more?&rdquo;</p><p>Sancho was about to answer, when his attention was diverted by seeing a harecome flying across the plain pursued by several greyhounds and sportsmen. Inits terror it ran to take shelter and hide itself under Dapple. Sancho caughtit alive and presented it to Don Quixote, who was saying, &ldquo;<i>Malumsignum, malum signum!</i> a hare flies, greyhounds chase it, Dulcinea appearsnot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your worship&rsquo;s a strange man,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;let&rsquo;stake it for granted that this hare is Dulcinea, and these greyhoundschasing it the malignant enchanters who turned her into a country wench;she flies, and I catch her and put her into your worship&rsquo;s hands,and you hold her in your arms and cherish her; what bad sign is that, orwhat ill omen is there to be found here?&rdquo;</p><p>The two boys who had been quarrelling came over to look at the hare, andSancho asked one of them what their quarrel was about. He was answered bythe one who had said, &ldquo;Thou shalt never see it again as long as thoulivest,&rdquo; that he had taken a cage full of crickets from the otherboy, and did not mean to give it back to him as long as he lived. Sanchotook out four cuartos from his pocket and gave them to the boy for thecage, which he placed in Don Quixote&rsquo;s hands, saying, &ldquo;There,señor! there are the omens broken and destroyed, and they have no more todo with our affairs, to my thinking, fool as I am, than with last year&rsquo;sclouds; and if I remember rightly I have heard the curate of our villagesay that it does not become Christians or sensible people to give any heedto these silly things; and even you yourself said the same to me some timeago, telling me that all Christians who minded omens were fools; but there&rsquo;sno need of making words about it; let us push on and go into our village.&rdquo;</p><p>The sportsmen came up and asked for their hare, which Don Quixote gavethem. They then went on, and upon the green at the entrance of the townthey came upon the curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco busy with theirbreviaries. It should be mentioned that Sancho had thrown, by way of asumpter-cloth, over Dapple and over the bundle of armour, the buckram robepainted with flames which they had put upon him at the duke&rsquo;s castlethe night Altisidora came back to life. He had also fixed the mitre onDapple&rsquo;s head, the oddest transformation and decoration that everass in the world underwent. They were at once recognised by both thecurate and the bachelor, who came towards them with open arms. Don Quixotedismounted and received them with a close embrace; and the boys, who arelynxes that nothing escapes, spied out the ass&rsquo;s mitre and camerunning to see it, calling out to one another, &ldquo;Come here, boys, andsee Sancho Panza&rsquo;s ass figged out finer than Mingo, and Don Quixote&rsquo;sbeast leaner than ever.&rdquo;</p><p>So at length, with the boys capering round them, and accompanied by thecurate and the bachelor, they made their entrance into the town, andproceeded to Don Quixote&rsquo;s house, at the door of which they foundhis housekeeper and niece, whom the news of his arrival had alreadyreached. It had been brought to Teresa Panza, Sancho&rsquo;s wife, aswell, and she with her hair all loose and half naked, dragging Sanchicaher daughter by the hand, ran out to meet her husband; but seeing himcoming in by no means as good case as she thought a governor ought to be,she said to him, &ldquo;How is it you come this way, husband? It seems tome you come tramping and footsore, and looking more like a disorderlyvagabond than a governor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Teresa,&rdquo; said Sancho; &ldquo;often &lsquo;wherethere are pegs there are no flitches;&rsquo; let&rsquo;s go into the houseand there you&rsquo;ll hear strange things. I bring money, and that&rsquo;sthe main thing, got by my own industry without wronging anybody.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You bring the money, my good husband,&rdquo; said Teresa, &ldquo;andno matter whether it was got this way or that; for, however you may havegot it, you&rsquo;ll not have brought any new practice into the world.&rdquo;</p><p>Sanchica embraced her father and asked him if he brought her anything, forshe had been looking out for him as for the showers of May; and she takinghold of him by the girdle on one side, and his wife by the hand, while thedaughter led Dapple, they made for their house, leaving Don Quixote inhis, in the hands of his niece and housekeeper, and in the company of thecurate and the bachelor.</p><p>Don Quixote at once, without any regard to time or season, withdrew inprivate with the bachelor and the curate, and in a few words told them ofhis defeat, and of the engagement he was under not to quit his village fora year, which he meant to keep to the letter without departing a hair&rsquo;sbreadth from it, as became a knight-errant bound by scrupulous good faithand the laws of knight-errantry; and of how he thought of turning shepherdfor that year, and taking his diversion in the solitude of the fields,where he could with perfect freedom give range to his thoughts of lovewhile he followed the virtuous pastoral calling; and he besought them, ifthey had not a great deal to do and were not prevented by more importantbusiness, to consent to be his companions, for he would buy sheep enoughto qualify them for shepherds; and the most important point of the wholeaffair, he could tell them, was settled, for he had given them names thatwould fit them to a T. The curate asked what they were. Don Quixotereplied that he himself was to be called the shepherd Quixotize and thebachelor the shepherd Carrascon, and the curate the shepherd Curambro, andSancho Panza the shepherd Pancino.</p><p>Both were astounded at Don Quixote&rsquo;s new craze; however, lest heshould once more make off out of the village from them in pursuit of hischivalry, they trusting that in the course of the year he might be cured,fell in with his new project, applauded his crazy idea as a bright one,and offered to share the life with him. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s more,&rdquo;said Samson Carrasco, &ldquo;I am, as all the world knows, a very famouspoet, and I&rsquo;ll be always making verses, pastoral, or courtly, or asit may come into my head, to pass away our time in those secluded regionswhere we shall be roaming. But what is most needful, sirs, is that each ofus should choose the name of the shepherdess he means to glorify in hisverses, and that we should not leave a tree, be it ever so hard, withoutwriting up and carving her name on it, as is the habit and custom oflove-smitten shepherds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;thoughI am relieved from looking for the name of an imaginary shepherdess, forthere&rsquo;s the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, the glory of thesebrooksides, the ornament of these meadows, the mainstay of beauty, thecream of all the graces, and, in a word, the being to whom all praise isappropriate, be it ever so hyperbolical.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said the curate; &ldquo;but we the others mustlook about for accommodating shepherdesses that will answer our purposeone way or another.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; added Samson Carrasco, &ldquo;if they fail us, we cancall them by the names of the ones in print that the world is filled with,Fílidas, Amarilises, Dianas, Fleridas, Galateas, Belisardas; for as theysell them in the market-places we may fairly buy them and make them ourown. If my lady, or I should say my shepherdess, happens to be called Ana,I&rsquo;ll sing her praises under the name of Anarda, and if Francisca, I&rsquo;llcall her Francenia, and if Lucia, Lucinda, for it all comes to the samething; and Sancho Panza, if he joins this fraternity, may glorify his wifeTeresa Panza as Teresaina.&rdquo;</p><p>Don Quixote laughed at the adaptation of the name, and the curate bestowedvast praise upon the worthy and honourable resolution he had made, andagain offered to bear him company all the time that he could spare fromhis imperative duties. And so they took their leave of him, recommendingand beseeching him to take care of his health and treat himself to asuitable diet.</p><p>It so happened his niece and the housekeeper overheard all the three ofthem said; and as soon as they were gone they both of them came in to DonQuixote, and said the niece, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, uncle? Now that wewere thinking you had come back to stay at home and lead a quietrespectable life there, are you going to get into fresh entanglements, andturn &lsquo;young shepherd, thou that comest here, young shepherd goingthere?&rsquo; Nay! indeed &lsquo;the straw is too hard now to make pipesof.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; added the housekeeper, &ldquo;will your worship be ableto bear, out in the fields, the heats of summer, and the chills of winter,and the howling of the wolves? Not you; for that&rsquo;s a life and abusiness for hardy men, bred and seasoned to such work almost from thetime they were in swaddling-clothes. Why, to make choice of evils, it&rsquo;sbetter to be a knight-errant than a shepherd! Look here, señor; take myadvice&mdash;and I&rsquo;m not giving it to you full of bread and wine, butfasting, and with fifty years upon my head&mdash;stay at home, look after youraffairs, go often to confession, be good to the poor, and upon my soul beit if any evil comes to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold your peace, my daughters,&rdquo; said Don Quixote; &ldquo;Iknow very well what my duty is; help me to bed, for I don&rsquo;t feelvery well; and rest assured that, knight-errant now or wandering shepherdto be, I shall never fail to have a care for your interests, as you willsee in the end.&rdquo; And the good wenches (for that they undoubtedlywere), the housekeeper and niece, helped him to bed, where they gave himsomething to eat and made him as comfortable as possible.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ch74b" id="ch74b"></a>CHAPTER LXXIV.<br/>OF HOW DON QUIXOTE FELL SICK, AND OF THE WILL HE MADE, AND HOW HE DIED</h3><p><br/><br/> <a name="p74a" id="p74a"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p74a.jpg (96K)" src="images/p74a.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p74a.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>As nothing that is man&rsquo;s can last for ever, but all tends everdownwards from its beginning to its end, and above all man&rsquo;s life,and as Don Quixote&rsquo;s enjoyed no special dispensation from heaven tostay its course, its end and close came when he least looked for it.For&mdash;whether it was of the dejection the thought of his defeat produced,or of heaven&rsquo;s will that so ordered it&mdash;a fever settled upon him andkept him in his bed for six days, during which he was often visited by hisfriends the curate, the bachelor, and the barber, while his good squireSancho Panza never quitted his bedside. They, persuaded that it was griefat finding himself vanquished, and the object of his heart, the liberationand disenchantment of Dulcinea, unattained, that kept him in this state,strove by all the means in their power to cheer him up; the bachelorbidding him take heart and get up to begin his pastoral life, for which hehimself, he said, had already composed an eclogue that would take theshine out of all Sannazaro had ever written, and had bought with his ownmoney two famous dogs to guard the flock, one called Barcino and the otherButron, which a herdsman of Quintanar had sold him.</p><p>But for all this Don Quixote could not shake off his sadness. His friendscalled in the doctor, who felt his pulse and was not very well satisfiedwith it, and said that in any case it would be well for him to attend tothe health of his soul, as that of his body was in a bad way. Don Quixoteheard this calmly; but not so his housekeeper, his niece, and his squire,who fell weeping bitterly, as if they had him lying dead before them. Thedoctor&rsquo;s opinion was that melancholy and depression were bringinghim to his end. Don Quixote begged them to leave him to himself, as he hada wish to sleep a little. They obeyed, and he slept at one stretch, as thesaying is, more than six hours, so that the housekeeper and niece thoughthe was going to sleep for ever. But at the end of that time he woke up,and in a loud voice exclaimed, &ldquo;Blessed be Almighty God, who hasshown me such goodness. In truth his mercies are boundless, and the sinsof men can neither limit them nor keep them back!&rdquo;</p><p>The niece listened with attention to her uncle&rsquo;s words, and theystruck her as more coherent than what usually fell from him, at leastduring his illness, so she asked, &ldquo;What are you saying, señor? Hasanything strange occurred? What mercies or what sins of men are youtalking of?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The mercies, niece,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;are those thatGod has this moment shown me, and with him, as I said, my sins are noimpediment to them. My reason is now free and clear, rid of the darkshadows of ignorance that my unhappy constant study of those detestablebooks of chivalry cast over it. Now I see through their absurdities anddeceptions, and it only grieves me that this destruction of my illusionshas come so late that it leaves me no time to make some amends by readingother books that might be a light to my soul. Niece, I feel myself at thepoint of death, and I would fain meet it in such a way as to show that mylife has not been so ill that I should leave behind me the name of amadman; for though I have been one, I would not that the fact should bemade plainer at my death. Call in to me, my dear, my good friends thecurate, the bachelor Samson Carrasco, and Master Nicholas the barber, forI wish to confess and make my will.&rdquo; But his niece was saved thetrouble by the entrance of the three. The instant Don Quixote saw them heexclaimed, &ldquo;Good news for you, good sirs, that I am no longer DonQuixote of La Mancha, but Alonso Quixano, whose way of life won for himthe name of Good. Now am I the enemy of Amadis of Gaul and of the wholecountless troop of his descendants; odious to me now are all the profanestories of knight-errantry; now I perceive my folly, and the peril intowhich reading them brought me; now, by God&rsquo;s mercy schooled into myright senses, I loathe them.&rdquo;</p><p>When the three heard him speak in this way, they had no doubt whateverthat some new craze had taken possession of him; and said Samson, &ldquo;What?Señor Don Quixote! Now that we have intelligence of the lady Dulcineabeing disenchanted, are you taking this line; now, just as we are on thepoint of becoming shepherds, to pass our lives singing, like princes, areyou thinking of turning hermit? Hush, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, be rationaland let&rsquo;s have no more nonsense.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that nonsense,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;that until nowhas been a reality to my hurt, my death will, with heaven&rsquo;s help,turn to my good. I feel, sirs, that I am rapidly drawing near death; atruce to jesting; let me have a confessor to confess me, and a notary tomake my will; for in extremities like this, man must not trifle with hissoul; and while the curate is confessing me let someone, I beg, go forthe notary.&rdquo;</p><p>They looked at one another, wondering at Don Quixote&rsquo;s words; but,though uncertain, they were inclined to believe him, and one of the signsby which they came to the conclusion he was dying was this so sudden andcomplete return to his senses after having been mad; for to the wordsalready quoted he added much more, so well expressed, so devout, and sorational, as to banish all doubt and convince them that he was sound ofmind. The curate turned them all out, and left alone with him confessedhim. The bachelor went for the notary and returned shortly afterwards withhim and with Sancho, who, having already learned from the bachelor thecondition his master was in, and finding the housekeeper and nieceweeping, began to blubber and shed tears.</p><p>The confession over, the curate came out saying, &ldquo;Alonso Quixano theGood is indeed dying, and is indeed in his right mind; we may now go in tohim while he makes his will.&rdquo;</p><p>This news gave a tremendous impulse to the brimming eyes of thehousekeeper, niece, and Sancho Panza his good squire, making the tearsburst from their eyes and a host of sighs from their hearts; for of atruth, as has been said more than once, whether as plain Alonso Quixanothe Good, or as Don Quixote of La Mancha, Don Quixote was always of agentle disposition and kindly in all his ways, and hence he was beloved,not only by those of his own house, but by all who knew him.</p><p>The notary came in with the rest, and as soon as the preamble of the willhad been set out and Don Quixote had commended his soul to God with allthe devout formalities that are usual, coming to the bequests, he said,&ldquo;Item, it is my will that, touching certain moneys in the hands ofSancho Panza (whom in my madness I made my squire), inasmuch as betweenhim and me there have been certain accounts and debits and credits, noclaim be made against him, nor any account demanded of him in respect ofthem; but that if anything remain over and above, after he has paidhimself what I owe him, the balance, which will be but little, shall behis, and much good may it do him; and if, as when I was mad I had a sharein giving him the government of an island, so, now that I am in my senses,I could give him that of a kingdom, it should be his, for the simplicityof his character and the fidelity of his conduct deserve it.&rdquo; Andthen, turning to Sancho, he said, &ldquo;Forgive me, my friend, that I ledthee to seem as mad as myself, making thee fall into the same error Imyself fell into, that there were and still are knights-errant in theworld.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Sancho weeping, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t die, master, buttake my advice and live many years; for the foolishest thing a man can doin this life is to let himself die without rhyme or reason, withoutanybody killing him, or any hands but melancholy&rsquo;s making an end ofhim. Come, don&rsquo;t be lazy, but get up from your bed and let us taketo the fields in shepherd&rsquo;s trim as we agreed. Perhaps behind somebush we shall find the lady Dulcinea disenchanted, as fine as fine can be.If it be that you are dying of vexation at having been vanquished, lay theblame on me, and say you were overthrown because I had girthed Rocinantebadly; besides you must have seen in your books of chivalry that it is acommon thing for knights to upset one another, and for him who isconquered to-day to be conqueror to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said Samson, &ldquo;and good Sancho Panza&rsquo;sview of these cases is quite right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sirs, not so fast,&rdquo; said Don Quixote, &ldquo;&lsquo;in lastyear&rsquo;s nests there are no birds this year.&rsquo; I was mad, now Iam in my senses; I was Don Quixote of La Mancha, I am now, as I said,Alonso Quixano the Good; and may my repentance and sincerity restore me tothe esteem you used to have for me; and now let Master Notary proceed.</p><p>&ldquo;Item, I leave all my property absolutely to Antonia Quixana myniece, here present, after all has been deducted from the most availableportion of it that may be required to satisfy the bequests I have made.And the first disbursement I desire to be made is the payment of the wagesI owe for the time my housekeeper has served me, with twenty ducats, overand above, for a gown. The curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco, nowpresent, I appoint my executors.</p><p>&ldquo;Item, it is my wish that if Antonia Quixana, my niece, desires tomarry, she shall marry a man of whom it shall be first of all ascertainedby information taken that he does not know what books of chivalry are; andif it should be proved that he does, and if, in spite of this, my nieceinsists upon marrying him, and does marry him, then that she shall forfeitthe whole of what I have left her, which my executors shall devote toworks of charity as they please.</p><p>&ldquo;Item, I entreat the aforesaid gentlemen my executors, that, if anyhappy chance should lead them to discover the author who is said to havewritten a history now going about under the title of &lsquo;Second Part ofthe Achievements of Don Quixote of La Mancha,&rsquo; they beg of him on mybehalf as earnestly as they can to forgive me for having been, withoutintending it, the cause of his writing so many and such monstrousabsurdities as he has written in it; for I am leaving the world with afeeling of compunction at having provoked him to write them.&rdquo;</p><p>With this he closed his will, and a faintness coming over him he stretchedhimself out at full length on the bed. All were in a flutter and madehaste to relieve him, and during the three days he lived after that onwhich he made his will he fainted away very often. The house was all inconfusion; but still the niece ate and the housekeeper drank and SanchoPanza enjoyed himself; for inheriting property wipes out or softens downin the heir the feeling of grief the dead man might be expected to leavebehind him.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> <a name="p74b" id="p74b"></a></p><div class="fig" style="width:60%;"><img alt="p74b.jpg (391K)" src="images/p74b.jpg" style="width:100%;" /></div><p><a href="images/p74b.jpg" style="width:100%;"><img alt="Full Size"src="images/enlarge.jpg" /></a><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>At last Don Quixote&rsquo;s end came, after he had received all thesacraments, and had in full and forcible terms expressed his detestationof books of chivalry. The notary was there at the time, and he said thatin no book of chivalry had he ever read of any knight-errant dying in hisbed so calmly and so like a Christian as Don Quixote, who amid the tearsand lamentations of all present yielded up his spirit, that is to saydied. On perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness thatAlonso Quixano the Good, commonly called Don Quixote of La Mancha, hadpassed away from this present life, and died naturally; and said hedesired this testimony in order to remove the possibility of any otherauthor save Cide Hamete Benengeli bringing him to life again falsely andmaking interminable stories out of his achievements.</p><p>Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose villageCide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the townsand villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right toadopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contendedfor Homer. The lamentations of Sancho and the niece and housekeeper areomitted here, as well as the new epitaphs upon his tomb; Samson Carrasco,however, put the following lines:</p><p class="poem">A doughty gentleman lies here;<br/>A stranger all his life to fear;<br/>Nor in his death could Death prevail,<br/>In that last hour, to make him quail.<br/><br/>He for the world but little cared;<br/>And at his feats the world was scared;<br/>A crazy man his life he passed,<br/>But in his senses died at last.</p><p>And said most sage Cide Hamete to his pen, &ldquo;Rest here, hung up bythis brass wire, upon this shelf, O my pen, whether of skilful make orclumsy cut I know not; here shalt thou remain long ages hence, unlesspresumptuous or malignant story-tellers take thee down to profane thee.But ere they touch thee warn them, and, as best thou canst, say to them:</p><p class="poem">Hold off! ye weaklings; hold your hands!<br/>Adventure it let none,<br/>For this emprise, my lord the king,<br/>Was meant for me alone.</p><p>For me alone was Don Quixote born, and I for him; it was his to act, mineto write; we two together make but one, notwithstanding and in spite ofthat pretended Tordesillesque writer who has ventured or would venturewith his great, coarse, ill-trimmed ostrich quill to write theachievements of my valiant knight;&mdash;no burden for his shoulders, norsubject for his frozen wit: whom, if perchance thou shouldst come to knowhim, thou shalt warn to leave at rest where they lie the weary moulderingbones of Don Quixote, and not to attempt to carry him off, in oppositionto all the privileges of death, to Old Castile, making him rise from thegrave where in reality and truth he lies stretched at full length,powerless to make any third expedition or new sally; for the two that hehas already made, so much to the enjoyment and approval of everybody towhom they have become known, in this as well as in foreign countries, arequite sufficient for the purpose of turning into ridicule the whole ofthose made by the whole set of the knights-errant; and so doing shalt thoudischarge thy Christian calling, giving good counsel to one that bearsill-will to thee. And I shall remain satisfied, and proud to have been thefirst who has ever enjoyed the fruit of his writings as fully as he coulddesire; for my desire has been no other than to deliver over to thedetestation of mankind the false and foolish tales of the books ofchivalry, which, thanks to that of my true Don Quixote, are even nowtottering, and doubtless doomed to fall for ever.
