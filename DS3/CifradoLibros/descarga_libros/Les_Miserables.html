MYRIEL</h3><p>In 1815, M. Charles-François-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;He was an old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied thesee of D&mdash;&mdash; since 1806.</p><p>Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance ofwhat we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for thesake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors andremarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment whenhe arrived in the diocese. True or false, that which is said of men oftenoccupies as important a place in their lives, and above all in theirdestinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a councillor ofthe Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar. Itwas said that his father, destining him to be the heir of his own post,had married him at a very early age, eighteen or twenty, in accordancewith a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families.In spite of this marriage, however, it was said that Charles Myrielcreated a great deal of talk. He was well formed, though rather short instature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the whole of the first portion ofhis life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.</p><p>The Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; theparliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were dispersed.M. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of theRevolution. There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from which shehad long suffered. He had no children. What took place next in the fate ofM. Myriel? The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall ofhis own family, the tragic spectacles of &rsquo;93, which were, perhaps, evenmore alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance, with themagnifying powers of terror,&mdash;did these cause the ideas ofrenunciation and solitude to germinate in him? Was he, in the midst ofthese distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenlysmitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimesoverwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes wouldnot shake, by striking at his existence and his fortune? No one could havetold: all that was known was, that when he returned from Italy he was apriest.</p><p>In 1804, M. Myriel was the Curé of B&mdash;&mdash; [Brignolles]. He wasalready advanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.</p><p>About the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with hiscuracy&mdash;just what, is not precisely known&mdash;took him to Paris.Among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for hisparishioners was M. le Cardinal Fesch. One day, when the Emperor had cometo visit his uncle, the worthy Curé, who was waiting in the anteroom,found himself present when His Majesty passed. Napoleon, on findinghimself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man, turned roundand said abruptly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is this good man who is staring at me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said M. Myriel, &ldquo;you are looking at a good man, and I at a greatman. Each of us can profit by it.&rdquo;</p><p>That very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Curé,and some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that hehad been appointed Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>What truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as tothe early portion of M. Myriel&rsquo;s life? No one knew. Very few families hadbeen acquainted with the Myriel family before the Revolution.</p><p>M. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town,where there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think. Hewas obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because he was abishop. But after all, the rumors with which his name was connected wererumors only,&mdash;noise, sayings, words; less than words&mdash;<i>palabres</i>,as the energetic language of the South expresses it.</p><p>However that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of residencein D&mdash;&mdash;, all the stories and subjects of conversation whichengross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen intoprofound oblivion. No one would have dared to mention them; no one wouldhave dared to recall them.</p><p>M. Myriel had arrived at D&mdash;&mdash; accompanied by an elderlyspinster, Mademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years hisjunior.</p><p>Their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as MademoiselleBaptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having been <i>theservant of M. le Curé</i>, now assumed the double title of maid toMademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.</p><p>Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; sherealized the ideal expressed by the word &ldquo;respectable&rdquo;; for it seems thata woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. She had neverbeen pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a succession ofholy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor andtransparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may becalled the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in her youth hadbecome transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity allowed theangel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a virgin. Her person seemedmade of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex; alittle matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever drooping;&mdash;a merepretext for a soul&rsquo;s remaining on the earth.</p><p>Madame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent andbustling; always out of breath,&mdash;in the first place, because of heractivity, and in the next, because of her asthma.</p><p>On his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with thehonors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop immediatelyafter a major-general. The mayor and the president paid the first call onhim, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general and the prefect.</p><p>The installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0002" id="link2HCH0002"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;M. MYRIELBECOMES M. WELCOME</h3><p>The episcopal palace of D&mdash;&mdash; adjoins the hospital.</p><p>The episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at thebeginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology of theFaculty of Paris, Abbé of Simore, who had been Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;in 1712. This palace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything aboutit had a grand air,&mdash;the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms,the chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walksencircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardensplanted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superbgallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the gardens,M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My LordsCharles Brûlart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d&rsquo;Embrun; Antoine deMesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendôme, GrandPrior of France, Abbé of Saint Honoré de Lérins; François de Berton deCrillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; César de Sabran de Forcalquier, bishop,Seignor of Glandève; and Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher inordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. The portraits of theseseven reverend personages decorated this apartment; and this memorabledate, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on atable of white marble.</p><p>The hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a smallgarden.</p><p>Three days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The visitended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to hishouse.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur the director of the hospital,&rdquo; said he to him, &ldquo;how many sickpeople have you at the present moment?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty-six, Monseigneur.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was the number which I counted,&rdquo; said the Bishop.</p><p>&ldquo;The beds,&rdquo; pursued the director, &ldquo;are very much crowded against eachother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is what I observed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the aircan be changed in them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it seems to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small for theconvalescents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That was what I said to myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In case of epidemics,&mdash;we have had the typhus fever this year; wehad the sweating sickness two years ago, and a hundred patients at times,&mdash;weknow not what to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the thought which occurred to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What would you have, Monseigneur?&rdquo; said the director. &ldquo;One must resignone&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;</p><p>This conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on theground floor.</p><p>The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to thedirector of the hospital.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;how many beds do you think this hall alone wouldhold?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monseigneur&rsquo;s dining-room?&rdquo; exclaimed the stupefied director.</p><p>The Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be takingmeasures and calculations with his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;It would hold full twenty beds,&rdquo; said he, as though speaking to himself.Then, raising his voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you something.There is evidently a mistake here. There are thirty-six of you, in five orsix small rooms. There are three of us here, and we have room for sixty.There is some mistake, I tell you; you have my house, and I have yours.Give me back my house; you are at home here.&rdquo;</p><p>On the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in theBishop&rsquo;s palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital.</p><p>M. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by theRevolution. His sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundredfrancs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage. M. Myrielreceived from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary of fifteenthousand francs. On the very day when he took up his abode in thehospital, M. Myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all,in the following manner. We transcribe here a note made by his own hand:&mdash;</p><p class="center">NOTE ON THE REGULATION OF MY HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.</p><table summary="" style=""><tr><td>For the little seminary</td><td>1,500 livres</td></tr><tr><td>Society of the mission</td><td>100    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>For the Lazarists of Montdidier</td><td>100    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Seminary for foreign missions in Paris</td><td>200    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Congregation of the Holy Spirit</td><td>150    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Religious establishments of the Holy Land</td><td>100    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Charitable maternity societies</td><td>300    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Extra, for that of Arles</td><td>50    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Work for the amelioration of prisons</td><td>400    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Work for the relief and delivery of prisoners</td><td>500    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>To liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt</td><td>1,000    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Addition to the salary of the poor teachers of the diocese</td><td>2,000    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Public granary of the Hautes-Alpes</td><td>100    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Congregation of the ladies of D&mdash;&mdash;, of Manosque, and of Sisteron,<br />for the gratuitous instruction of poor girls</td><td>1,500    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>For the poor</td><td>6,000    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>My personal expenses</td><td>1,000    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>15,000    &rdquo;</td></tr></table><p>M. Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period thathe occupied the see of D&mdash;&mdash; As has been seen, he called it <i>regulatinghis household expenses</i>.</p><p>This arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by MademoiselleBaptistine. This holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D&mdash;&mdash; as atone and the same time her brother and her bishop, her friend according tothe flesh and her superior according to the Church. She simply loved andvenerated him. When he spoke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded heradherence. Their only servant, Madame Magloire, grumbled a little. It willbe observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himself only onethousand livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle Baptistine,made fifteen hundred francs a year. On these fifteen hundred francs thesetwo old women and the old man subsisted.</p><p>And when a village curate came to D&mdash;&mdash;, the Bishop still foundmeans to entertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire,and to the intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.</p><p>One day, after he had been in D&mdash;&mdash; about three months, theBishop said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And still I am quite cramped with it all!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should think so!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Magloire. &ldquo;Monseigneur has not evenclaimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of hiscarriage in town, and for his journeys about the diocese. It was customaryfor bishops in former days.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; cried the Bishop, &ldquo;you are quite right, Madame Magloire.&rdquo;</p><p>And he made his demand.</p><p>Some time afterwards the General Council took this demand underconsideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs, underthis heading: <i>Allowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of carriage,expenses of posting, and expenses of pastoral visits.</i></p><p>This provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator ofthe Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred whichfavored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificentsenatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D&mdash;&mdash;, wrote toM. Bigot de Préameneu, the minister of public worship, a very angry andconfidential note on the subject, from which we extract these authenticlines:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Expenses of carriage? What can be done with it in a town of less thanfour thousand inhabitants? Expenses of journeys? What is the use of thesetrips, in the first place? Next, how can the posting be accomplished inthese mountainous parts? There are no roads. No one travels otherwise thanon horseback. Even the bridge between Durance and Château-Arnoux canbarely support ox-teams. These priests are all thus, greedy andavaricious. This man played the good priest when he first came. Now hedoes like the rest; he must have a carriage and a posting-chaise, he musthave luxuries, like the bishops of the olden days. Oh, all thispriesthood! Things will not go well, M. le Comte, until the Emperor hasfreed us from these black-capped rascals. Down with the Pope! [Matterswere getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part, I am for Cæsar alone.&rdquo;Etc., etc.</p><p>On the other hand, this affair afforded great delight to Madame Magloire.&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said she to Mademoiselle Baptistine; &ldquo;Monseigneur began with otherpeople, but he has had to wind up with himself, after all. He hasregulated all his charities. Now here are three thousand francs for us! Atlast!&rdquo;</p><p>That same evening the Bishop wrote out and handed to his sister amemorandum conceived in the following terms:&mdash;</p><p class="center">EXPENSES OF CARRIAGE AND CIRCUIT.</p><table summary="" style=""><tr><td>For furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital</td><td>1,500 livres</td></tr><tr><td>For the maternity charitable society of Aix</td><td>250    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>For the maternity charitable society of Draguignan</td><td>250    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>For foundlings</td><td>500    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>For orphans</td><td>500    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>3,000    &rdquo;</td></tr></table><p>Such was M. Myriel&rsquo;s budget.</p><p>As for the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees for marriage bans,dispensations, private baptisms, sermons, benedictions, of churches orchapels, marriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with allthe more asperity, since he bestowed them on the needy.</p><p>After a time, offerings of money flowed in. Those who had and those wholacked knocked at M. Myriel&rsquo;s door,&mdash;the latter in search of the almswhich the former came to deposit. In less than a year the Bishop hadbecome the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those indistress. Considerable sums of money passed through his hands, but nothingcould induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life, or addanything superfluous to his bare necessities.</p><p>Far from it. As there is always more wretchedness below than there isbrotherhood above, all was given away, so to speak, before it wasreceived. It was like water on dry soil; no matter how much money hereceived, he never had any. Then he stripped himself.</p><p>The usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at thehead of their charges and their pastoral letters, the poor people of thecountry-side had selected, with a sort of affectionate instinct, among thenames and prenomens of their bishop, that which had a meaning for them;and they never called him anything except Monseigneur Bienvenu [Welcome].We will follow their example, and will also call him thus when we haveoccasion to name him. Moreover, this appellation pleased him.</p><p>&ldquo;I like that name,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Bienvenu makes up for the Monseigneur.&rdquo;</p><p>We do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; weconfine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0003" id="link2HCH0003"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;A HARD BISHOPRIC FOR A GOOD BISHOP</h3><p>The Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted hiscarriage into alms. The diocese of D&mdash;&mdash; is a fatiguing one.There are very few plains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, aswe have just seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and twohundred and eighty-five auxiliary chapels. To visit all these is quite atask.</p><p>The Bishop managed to do it. He went on foot when it was in theneighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on adonkey in the mountains. The two old women accompanied him. When the tripwas too hard for them, he went alone.</p><p>One day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. He wasmounted on an ass. His purse, which was very dry at that moment, did notpermit him any other equipage. The mayor of the town came to receive himat the gate of the town, and watched him dismount from his ass, withscandalized eyes. Some of the citizens were laughing around him. &ldquo;Monsieurthe Mayor,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;and Messieurs Citizens, I perceive that Ishock you. You think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animalwhich was used by Jesus Christ. I have done so from necessity, I assureyou, and not from vanity.&rdquo;</p><p>In the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and talked ratherthan preached. He never went far in search of his arguments and hisexamples. He quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of aneighboring district. In the cantons where they were harsh to the poor, hesaid: &ldquo;Look at the people of Briançon! They have conferred on the poor, onwidows and orphans, the right to have their meadows mown three days inadvance of every one else. They rebuild their houses for them gratuitouslywhen they are ruined. Therefore it is a country which is blessed by God.For a whole century, there has not been a single murderer among them.&rdquo;</p><p>In villages which were greedy for profit and harvest, he said: &ldquo;Look atthe people of Embrun! If, at the harvest season, the father of a familyhas his son away on service in the army, and his daughters at service inthe town, and if he is ill and incapacitated, the curé recommends him tothe prayers of the congregation; and on Sunday, after the mass, all theinhabitants of the village&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;go to thepoor man&rsquo;s field and do his harvesting for him, and carry his straw andhis grain to his granary.&rdquo; To families divided by questions of money andinheritance he said: &ldquo;Look at the mountaineers of Devolny, a country sowild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years. Well,when the father of a family dies, the boys go off to seek their fortunes,leaving the property to the girls, so that they may find husbands.&rdquo; To thecantons which had a taste for lawsuits, and where the farmers ruinedthemselves in stamped paper, he said: &ldquo;Look at those good peasants in thevalley of Queyras! There are three thousand souls of them. Mon Dieu! it islike a little republic. Neither judge nor bailiff is known there. Themayor does everything. He allots the imposts, taxes each personconscientiously, judges quarrels for nothing, divides inheritances withoutcharge, pronounces sentences gratuitously; and he is obeyed, because he isa just man among simple men.&rdquo; To villages where he found no schoolmaster,he quoted once more the people of Queyras: &ldquo;Do you know how they manage?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths cannotalways support a teacher, they have schoolmasters who are paid by thewhole valley, who make the round of the villages, spending a week in thisone, ten days in that, and instruct them. These teachers go to the fairs.I have seen them there. They are to be recognized by the quill pens whichthey wear in the cord of their hat. Those who teach reading only have onepen; those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens; those who teachreading, reckoning, and Latin have three pens. But what a disgrace to beignorant! Do like the people of Queyras!&rdquo;</p><p>Thus he discoursed gravely and paternally; in default of examples, heinvented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases and manyimages, which characteristic formed the real eloquence of Jesus Christ.And being convinced himself, he was persuasive.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0004" id="link2HCH0004"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;WORKS CORRESPONDING TO WORDS</h3><p>His conversation was gay and affable. He put himself on a level with thetwo old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he laughed, itwas the laugh of a schoolboy. Madame Magloire liked to call him Your Grace[<i>Votre Grandeur</i>]. One day he rose from his armchair, and went tohis library in search of a book. This book was on one of the uppershelves. As the bishop was rather short of stature, he could not reach it.&ldquo;Madame Magloire,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;fetch me a chair. My greatness [<i>grandeur</i>]does not reach as far as that shelf.&rdquo;</p><p>One of his distant relatives, Madame la Comtesse de Lô, rarely allowed anopportunity to escape of enumerating, in his presence, what she designatedas &ldquo;the expectations&rdquo; of her three sons. She had numerous relatives, whowere very old and near to death, and of whom her sons were the naturalheirs. The youngest of the three was to receive from a grandaunt a goodhundred thousand livres of income; the second was the heir by entail tothe title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to succeed to the peerageof his grandfather. The Bishop was accustomed to listen in silence tothese innocent and pardonable maternal boasts. On one occasion, however,he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual, while Madame de Lô wasrelating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these&ldquo;expectations.&rdquo; She interrupted herself impatiently: &ldquo;Mon Dieu, cousin!What are you thinking about?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am thinking,&rdquo; replied the Bishop, &ldquo;of asingular remark, which is to be found, I believe, in St. Augustine,&mdash;&lsquo;Placeyour hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>At another time, on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentlemanof the country-side, wherein not only the dignities of the dead man, butalso the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives, spread overan entire page: &ldquo;What a stout back Death has!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What astrange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him, and how much witmust men have, in order thus to press the tomb into the service ofvanity!&rdquo;</p><p>He was gifted, on occasion, with a gentle raillery, which almost alwaysconcealed a serious meaning. In the course of one Lent, a youthful vicarcame to D&mdash;&mdash;, and preached in the cathedral. He was tolerablyeloquent. The subject of his sermon was charity. He urged the rich to giveto the poor, in order to avoid hell, which he depicted in the mostfrightful manner of which he was capable, and to win paradise, which herepresented as charming and desirable. Among the audience there was awealthy retired merchant, who was somewhat of a usurer, named M. Géborand,who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth, serges,and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life had M. Géborand bestowedalms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that sermon, it wasobserved that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old beggar-women atthe door of the cathedral. There were six of them to share it. One day theBishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity, and saidto his sister, with a smile, &ldquo;There is M. Géborand purchasing paradise fora sou.&rdquo;</p><p>When it was a question of charity, he was not to be rebuffed even by arefusal, and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which inducedreflection. Once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room of thetown; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier, a wealthy andavaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one and the same time, anultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian. This variety of man has actuallyexisted. When the Bishop came to him, he touched his arm, <i>&ldquo;You mustgive me something, M. le Marquis.&rdquo;</i> The Marquis turned round andanswered dryly, <i>&ldquo;I have poor people of my own, Monseigneur.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give themto me,&rdquo;</i> replied the Bishop.</p><p>One day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My very dear brethren, my good friends, there are thirteen hundred andtwenty thousand peasants&rsquo; dwellings in France which have but threeopenings; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have buttwo openings, the door and one window; and three hundred and forty-sixthousand cabins besides which have but one opening, the door. And thisarises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows. Just putpoor families, old women and little children, in those buildings, andbehold the fevers and maladies which result! Alas! God gives air to men;the law sells it to them. I do not blame the law, but I bless God. In thedepartment of the Isère, in the Var, in the two departments of the Alpes,the Hautes, and the Basses, the peasants have not even wheelbarrows; theytransport their manure on the backs of men; they have no candles, and theyburn resinous sticks, and bits of rope dipped in pitch. That is the stateof affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of Dauphiné. Theymake bread for six months at one time; they bake it with dried cow-dung.In the winter they break this bread up with an axe, and they soak it fortwenty-four hours, in order to render it eatable. My brethren, have pity!behold the suffering on all sides of you!&rdquo;</p><p>Born a Provençal, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of thesouth. He said, <i>&ldquo;En bé! moussu, sés sagé?&rdquo;</i> as in lower Languedoc;<i>&ldquo;Onté anaras passa?&rdquo;</i> as in the Basses-Alpes; <i>&ldquo;Puerte un bouenmoutu embe un bouen fromage grase,&rdquo;</i> as in upper Dauphiné. This pleasedthe people extremely, and contributed not a little to win him access toall spirits. He was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in themountains. He understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgarof idioms. As he spoke all tongues, he entered into all hearts.</p><p>Moreover, he was the same towards people of the world and towards thelower classes. He condemned nothing in haste and without takingcircumstances into account. He said, &ldquo;Examine the road over which thefault has passed.&rdquo;</p><p>Being, as he described himself with a smile, an <i>ex-sinner</i>, he hadnone of the asperities of austerity, and he professed, with a good deal ofdistinctness, and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous, adoctrine which may be summed up as follows:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Man has upon him his flesh, which is at once his burden and histemptation. He drags it with him and yields to it. He must watch it, checkit, repress it, and obey it only at the last extremity. There may be somefault even in this obedience; but the fault thus committed is venial; itis a fall, but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer.</p><p>&ldquo;To be a saint is the exception; to be an upright man is the rule. Err,fall, sin if you will, but be upright.</p><p>&ldquo;The least possible sin is the law of man. No sin at all is the dream ofthe angel. All which is terrestrial is subject to sin. Sin is agravitation.&rdquo;</p><p>When he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly, and growing angry veryquickly, &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; he said, with a smile; &ldquo;to all appearance, this is agreat crime which all the world commits. These are hypocrisies which havetaken fright, and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves undershelter.&rdquo;</p><p>He was indulgent towards women and poor people, on whom the burden ofhuman society rest. He said, &ldquo;The faults of women, of children, of thefeeble, the indigent, and the ignorant, are the fault of the husbands, thefathers, the masters, the strong, the rich, and the wise.&rdquo;</p><p>He said, moreover, &ldquo;Teach those who are ignorant as many things aspossible; society is culpable, in that it does not afford instructiongratis; it is responsible for the night which it produces. This soul isfull of shadow; sin is therein committed. The guilty one is not the personwho has committed the sin, but the person who has created the shadow.&rdquo;</p><p>It will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judgingthings: I suspect that he obtained it from the Gospel.</p><p>One day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation and on thepoint of trial, discussed in a drawing-room. A wretched man, being at theend of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love for awoman, and for the child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting was stillpunishable with death at that epoch. The woman had been arrested in theact of passing the first false piece made by the man. She was held, butthere were no proofs except against her. She alone could accuse her lover,and destroy him by her confession. She denied; they insisted. Shepersisted in her denial. Thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney forthe crown. He invented an infidelity on the part of the lover, andsucceeded, by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented, inpersuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival, and that the manwas deceiving her. Thereupon, exasperated by jealousy, she denounced herlover, confessed all, proved all.</p><p>The man was ruined. He was shortly to be tried at Aix with his accomplice.They were relating the matter, and each one was expressing enthusiasm overthe cleverness of the magistrate. By bringing jealousy into play, he hadcaused the truth to burst forth in wrath, he had educed the justice ofrevenge. The Bishop listened to all this in silence. When they hadfinished, he inquired,&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are this man and woman to be tried?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At the Court of Assizes.&rdquo;</p><p>He went on, &ldquo;And where will the advocate of the crown be tried?&rdquo;</p><p>A tragic event occurred at D&mdash;&mdash; A man was condemned to deathfor murder. He was a wretched fellow, not exactly educated, not exactlyignorant, who had been a mountebank at fairs, and a writer for the public.The town took a great interest in the trial. On the eve of the day fixedfor the execution of the condemned man, the chaplain of the prison fellill. A priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments. Theysent for the curé. It seems that he refused to come, saying, &ldquo;That is noaffair of mine. I have nothing to do with that unpleasant task, and withthat mountebank: I, too, am ill; and besides, it is not my place.&rdquo; Thisreply was reported to the Bishop, who said, <i>&ldquo;Monsieur le Curé is right:it is not his place; it is mine.&rdquo;</i></p><p>He went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the&ldquo;mountebank,&rdquo; called him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke to him.He passed the entire day with him, forgetful of food and sleep, praying toGod for the soul of the condemned man, and praying the condemned man forhis own. He told him the best truths, which are also the most simple. Hewas father, brother, friend; he was bishop only to bless. He taught himeverything, encouraged and consoled him. The man was on the point of dyingin despair. Death was an abyss to him. As he stood trembling on itsmournful brink, he recoiled with horror. He was not sufficiently ignorantto be absolutely indifferent. His condemnation, which had been a profoundshock, had, in a manner, broken through, here and there, that wall whichseparates us from the mystery of things, and which we call life. He gazedincessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches, and beheldonly darkness. The Bishop made him see light.</p><p>On the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, theBishop was still there. He followed him, and exhibited himself to the eyesof the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon hisneck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords.</p><p>He mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. Thesufferer, who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day, wasradiant. He felt that his soul was reconciled, and he hoped in God. TheBishop embraced him, and at the moment when the knife was about to fall,he said to him: &ldquo;God raises from the dead him whom man slays; he whom hisbrothers have rejected finds his Father once more. Pray, believe, enterinto life: the Father is there.&rdquo; When he descended from the scaffold,there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to lethim pass. They did not know which was most worthy of admiration, hispallor or his serenity. On his return to the humble dwelling, which hedesignated, with a smile, as <i>his palace</i>, he said to his sister, <i>&ldquo;Ihave just officiated pontifically.&rdquo;</i></p><p>Since the most sublime things are often those which are the leastunderstood, there were people in the town who said, when commenting onthis conduct of the Bishop, <i>&ldquo;It is affectation.&rdquo;</i></p><p>This, however, was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms. Thepopulace, which perceives no jest in holy deeds, was touched, and admiredhim.</p><p>As for the Bishop, it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine,and it was a long time before he recovered from it.</p><p>In fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it hassomething about it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certainindifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing uponit, from saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a guillotine withone&rsquo;s own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the shock is violent;one is forced to decide, and to take part for or against. Some admire it,like de Maistre; others execrate it, like Beccaria. The guillotine is theconcretion of the law; it is called <i>vindicate</i>; it is not neutral,and it does not permit you to remain neutral. He who sees it shivers withthe most mysterious of shivers. All social problems erect theirinterrogation point around this chopping-knife. The scaffold is a vision.The scaffold is not a piece of carpentry; the scaffold is not a machine;the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood, ironand cords.</p><p>It seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know not what sombreinitiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter&rsquo;s work saw, thatthis machine heard, that this mechanism understood, that this wood, thisiron, and these cords were possessed of will. In the frightful meditationinto which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terribleguise, and as though taking part in what is going on. The scaffold is theaccomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eats flesh, it drinks blood;the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and thecarpenter, a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composedof all the death which it has inflicted.</p><p>Therefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the day followingthe execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishop appeared to becrushed. The almost violent serenity of the funereal moment haddisappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented him. He, whogenerally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction, seemedto be reproaching himself. At times he talked to himself, and stammeredlugubrious monologues in a low voice. This is one which his sisteroverheard one evening and preserved: &ldquo;I did not think that it was somonstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such adegree as not to perceive human law. Death belongs to God alone. By whatright do men touch that unknown thing?&rdquo;</p><p>In course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished.Nevertheless, it was observed that the Bishop thenceforth avoided passingthe place of execution.</p><p>M. Myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick anddying. He did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty andhis greatest labor. Widowed and orphaned families had no need to summonhim; he came of his own accord. He understood how to sit down and hold hispeace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love, ofthe mother who had lost her child. As he knew the moment for silence heknew also the moment for speech. Oh, admirable consoler! He sought not toefface sorrow by forgetfulness, but to magnify and dignify it by hope. Hesaid:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead. Think notof that which perishes. Gaze steadily. You will perceive the living lightof your well-beloved dead in the depths of heaven.&rdquo; He knew that faith iswholesome. He sought to counsel and calm the despairing man, by pointingout to him the resigned man, and to transform the grief which gazes upon agrave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0005" id="link2HCH0005"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU MADE HIS CASSOCKS LAST TOO LONG</h3><p>The private life of M. Myriel was filled with the same thoughts as hispublic life. The voluntary poverty in which the Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;lived, would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who couldhave viewed it close at hand.</p><p>Like all old men, and like the majority of thinkers, he slept little. Thisbrief slumber was profound. In the morning he meditated for an hour, thenhe said his mass, either at the cathedral or in his own house. His masssaid, he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows.Then he set to work.</p><p>A Bishop is a very busy man: he must every day receive the secretary ofthe bishopric, who is generally a canon, and nearly every day hisvicars-general. He has congregations to reprove, privileges to grant, awhole ecclesiastical library to examine,&mdash;prayer-books, diocesancatechisms, books of hours, etc.,&mdash;charges to write, sermons toauthorize, curés and mayors to reconcile, a clerical correspondence, anadministrative correspondence; on one side the State, on the other theHoly See; and a thousand matters of business.</p><p>What time was left to him, after these thousand details of business, andhis offices and his breviary, he bestowed first on the necessitous, thesick, and the afflicted; the time which was left to him from theafflicted, the sick, and the necessitous, he devoted to work. Sometimes hedug in his garden; again, he read or wrote. He had but one word for boththese kinds of toil; he called them <i>gardening</i>. &ldquo;The mind is agarden,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Towards midday, when the weather was fine, he went forth and took astroll in the country or in town, often entering lowly dwellings. He wasseen walking alone, buried in his own thoughts, his eyes cast down,supporting himself on his long cane, clad in his wadded purple garment ofsilk, which was very warm, wearing purple stockings inside his coarseshoes, and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels oflarge bullion to droop from its three points.</p><p>It was a perfect festival wherever he appeared. One would have said thathis presence had something warming and luminous about it. The children andthe old people came out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as for the sun. Hebestowed his blessing, and they blessed him. They pointed out his house toany one who was in need of anything.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007"></a><img src="images/1b1-5-comfortor.jpg" alt="The Comforter" width="100%" /></div><p>Here and there he halted, accosted the little boys and girls, and smiledupon the mothers. He visited the poor so long as he had any money; when heno longer had any, he visited the rich.</p><p>As he made his cassocks last a long while, and did not wish to have itnoticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak.This inconvenienced him somewhat in summer.</p><p>On his return, he dined. The dinner resembled his breakfast.</p><p>At half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister, MadameMagloire standing behind them and serving them at table. Nothing could bemore frugal than this repast. If, however, the Bishop had one of his curésto supper, Madame Magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serveMonseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake, or with some fine gamefrom the mountains. Every curé furnished the pretext for a good meal: theBishop did not interfere. With that exception, his ordinary diet consistedonly of vegetables boiled in water, and oil soup. Thus it was said in thetown, <i>when the Bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a curé, heindulges in the cheer of a trappist</i>.</p><p>After supper he conversed for half an hour with Mademoiselle Baptistineand Madame Magloire; then he retired to his own room and set to writing,sometimes on loose sheets, and again on the margin of some folio. He was aman of letters and rather learned. He left behind him five or six verycurious manuscripts; among others, a dissertation on this verse inGenesis, <i>In the beginning, the spirit of God floated upon the waters</i>.With this verse he compares three texts: the Arabic verse which says, <i>Thewinds of God blew;</i> Flavius Josephus who says, <i>A wind from above wasprecipitated upon the earth;</i> and finally, the Chaldaic paraphrase ofOnkelos, which renders it, <i>A wind coming from God blew upon the face ofthe waters</i>. In another dissertation, he examines the theological worksof Hugo, Bishop of Ptolemaïs, great-grand-uncle to the writer of thisbook, and establishes the fact, that to this bishop must be attributed thedivers little works published during the last century, under the pseudonymof Barleycourt.</p><p>Sometimes, in the midst of his reading, no matter what the book might bewhich he had in his hand, he would suddenly fall into a profoundmeditation, whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages ofthe volume itself. These lines have often no connection whatever with thebook which contains them. We now have under our eyes a note written by himon the margin of a quarto entitled <i>Correspondence of Lord Germain withGenerals Clinton, Cornwallis, and the Admirals on the American station.Versailles, Poinçot, book-seller; and Paris, Pissot, bookseller, Quai desAugustins.</i></p><p>Here is the note:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, you who are!</p><p>&ldquo;Ecclesiastes calls you the All-powerful; the Maccabees call you theCreator; the Epistle to the Ephesians calls you liberty; Baruch calls youImmensity; the Psalms call you Wisdom and Truth; John calls you Light; theBooks of Kings call you Lord; Exodus calls you Providence; Leviticus,Sanctity; Esdras, Justice; the creation calls you God; man calls youFather; but Solomon calls you Compassion, and that is the most beautifulof all your names.&rdquo;</p><p>Toward nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening the two women retired and betookthemselves to their chambers on the first floor, leaving him alone untilmorning on the ground floor.</p><p>It is necessary that we should, in this place, give an exact idea of thedwelling of the Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0006" id="link2HCH0006"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;WHO GUARDED HIS HOUSE FOR HIM</h3><p>The house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of a ground floor,and one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, three chambers onthe first, and an attic above. Behind the house was a garden, a quarter ofan acre in extent. The two women occupied the first floor; the Bishop waslodged below. The first room, opening on the street, served him asdining-room, the second was his bedroom, and the third his oratory. Therewas no exit possible from this oratory, except by passing through thebedroom, nor from the bedroom, without passing through the dining-room. Atthe end of the suite, in the oratory, there was a detached alcove with abed, for use in cases of hospitality. The Bishop offered this bed tocountry curates whom business or the requirements of their parishesbrought to D&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>The pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had been added to thehouse, and abutted on the garden, had been transformed into a kitchen andcellar. In addition to this, there was in the garden a stable, which hadformerly been the kitchen of the hospital, and in which the Bishop kepttwo cows. No matter what the quantity of milk they gave, he invariablysent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital.</p><p><i>&ldquo;I am paying my tithes,&rdquo;</i> he said.</p><p>His bedroom was tolerably large, and rather difficult to warm in badweather. As wood is extremely dear at D&mdash;&mdash;, he hit upon theidea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed. Herehe passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold: he called it his <i>wintersalon</i>.</p><p>In this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other furniturethan a square table in white wood, and four straw-seated chairs. Inaddition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an antique sideboard,painted pink, in water colors. Out of a similar sideboard, properly drapedwith white napery and imitation lace, the Bishop had constructed the altarwhich decorated his oratory.</p><p>His wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D&mdash;&mdash; had morethan once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar forMonseigneur&rsquo;s oratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and hadgiven it to the poor. &ldquo;The most beautiful of altars,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is thesoul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking God.&rdquo;</p><p>In his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an armchair,also in straw, in his bedroom. When, by chance, he received seven or eightpersons at one time, the prefect, or the general, or the staff of theregiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little seminary, thechairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable, theprie-Dieu from the oratory, and the armchair from the bedroom: in thisway as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors. A roomwas dismantled for each new guest.</p><p>It sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party; the Bishop thenrelieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front of thechimney if it was winter, or by strolling in the garden if it was summer.</p><p>There was still another chair in the detached alcove, but the straw washalf gone from it, and it had but three legs, so that it was of serviceonly when propped against the wall. Mademoiselle Baptistine had also inher own room a very large easy-chair of wood, which had formerly beengilded, and which was covered with flowered pekin; but they had beenobliged to hoist this bergère up to the first story through the window, asthe staircase was too narrow; it could not, therefore, be reckoned amongthe possibilities in the way of furniture.</p><p>Mademoiselle Baptistine&rsquo;s ambition had been to be able to purchase a setof drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht velvet, stamped with a rosepattern, and with mahogany in swan&rsquo;s neck style, with a sofa. But thiswould have cost five hundred francs at least, and in view of the fact thatshe had only been able to lay by forty-two francs and ten sous for thispurpose in the course of five years, she had ended by renouncing the idea.However, who is there who has attained his ideal?</p><p>Nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the Bishop&rsquo;sbedchamber. A glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was the bed,&mdash;ahospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in the shadow of thebed, behind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet, which stillbetrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world: there were two doors,one near the chimney, opening into the oratory; the other near thebookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase was a large cupboardwith glass doors filled with books; the chimney was of wood painted torepresent marble, and habitually without fire. In the chimney stood a pairof firedogs of iron, ornamented above with two garlanded vases, andflutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf, which was asort of episcopal luxury; above the chimney-piece hung a crucifix ofcopper, with the silver worn off, fixed on a background of threadbarevelvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen; near the glassdoor a large table with an inkstand, loaded with a confusion of papers andwith huge volumes; before the table an armchair of straw; in front of thebed a prie-Dieu, borrowed from the oratory.</p><p>Two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of thebed. Small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the sideof these figures indicated that the portraits represented, one the Abbé ofChaliot, bishop of Saint Claude; the other, the Abbé Tourteau,vicar-general of Agde, abbé of Grand-Champ, order of Cîteaux, diocese ofChartres. When the Bishop succeeded to this apartment, after the hospitalpatients, he had found these portraits there, and had left them. They werepriests, and probably donors&mdash;two reasons for respecting them. Allthat he knew about these two persons was, that they had been appointed bythe king, the one to his bishopric, the other to his benefice, on the sameday, the 27th of April, 1785. Madame Magloire having taken the picturesdown to dust, the Bishop had discovered these particulars written inwhitish ink on a little square of paper, yellowed by time, and attached tothe back of the portrait of the Abbé of Grand-Champ with four wafers.</p><p>At his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff, whichfinally became so old, that, in order to avoid the expense of a new one,Madame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it.This seam took the form of a cross. The Bishop often called attention toit: &ldquo;How delightful that is!&rdquo; he said.</p><p>All the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground flooras well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is a fashionin barracks and hospitals.</p><p>However, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath thepaper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the apartment ofMademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. Before becoming ahospital, this house had been the ancient parliament house of theBourgeois. Hence this decoration. The chambers were paved in red bricks,which were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all the beds.Altogether, this dwelling, which was attended to by the two women, wasexquisitely clean from top to bottom. This was the sole luxury which theBishop permitted. He said, <i>&ldquo;That takes nothing from the poor.&rdquo;</i></p><p>It must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his formerpossessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle, which MadameMagloire contemplated every day with delight, as they glistened splendidlyupon the coarse linen cloth. And since we are now painting the Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;as he was in reality, we must add that he had said more than once, &ldquo;I findit difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes.&rdquo;</p><p>To this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver,which he had inherited from a great-aunt. These candlesticks held two waxcandles, and usually figured on the Bishop&rsquo;s chimney-piece. When he hadany one to dinner, Madame Magloire lighted the two candles and set thecandlesticks on the table.</p><p>In the Bishop&rsquo;s own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a smallcupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives andforks and the big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, that thekey was never removed.</p><p>The garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which wehave mentioned, was composed of four alleys in cross-form, radiating froma tank. Another walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirted the whitewall which enclosed it. These alleys left behind them four square plotsrimmed with box. In three of these, Madame Magloire cultivated vegetables;in the fourth, the Bishop had planted some flowers; here and there stood afew fruit-trees. Madame Magloire had once remarked, with a sort of gentlemalice: &ldquo;Monseigneur, you who turn everything to account, have,nevertheless, one useless plot. It would be better to grow salads therethan bouquets.&rdquo; &ldquo;Madame Magloire,&rdquo; retorted the Bishop, &ldquo;you are mistaken.The beautiful is as useful as the useful.&rdquo; He added after a pause, &ldquo;Moreso, perhaps.&rdquo;</p><p>This plot, consisting of three or four beds, occupied the Bishop almost asmuch as did his books. He liked to pass an hour or two there, trimming,hoeing, and making holes here and there in the earth, into which hedropped seeds. He was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could havewished to see him. Moreover, he made no pretensions to botany; he ignoredgroups and consistency; he made not the slightest effort to decide betweenTournefort and the natural method; he took part neither with the budsagainst the cotyledons, nor with Jussieu against Linnæus. He did not studyplants; he loved flowers. He respected learned men greatly; he respectedthe ignorant still more; and, without ever failing in these two respects,he watered his flower-beds every summer evening with a tin watering-potpainted green.</p><p>The house had not a single door which could be locked. The door of thedining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedralsquare, had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door ofa prison. The Bishop had had all this ironwork removed, and this door wasnever fastened, either by night or by day, with anything except the latch.All that the first passer-by had to do at any hour, was to give it a push.At first, the two women had been very much tried by this door, which wasnever fastened, but Monsieur de D&mdash;&mdash; had said to them, &ldquo;Havebolts put on your rooms, if that will please you.&rdquo; They had ended bysharing his confidence, or by at least acting as though they shared it.Madame Magloire alone had frights from time to time. As for the Bishop,his thought can be found explained, or at least indicated, in the threelines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, &ldquo;This is the shade ofdifference: the door of the physician should never be shut, the door ofthe priest should always be open.&rdquo;</p><p>On another book, entitled <i>Philosophy of the Medical Science</i>, he hadwritten this other note: &ldquo;Am not I a physician like them? I also have mypatients, and then, too, I have some whom I call my unfortunates.&rdquo;</p><p>Again he wrote: &ldquo;Do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you.The very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter.&rdquo;</p><p>It chanced that a worthy curé, I know not whether it was the curé ofCouloubroux or the curé of Pompierry, took it into his head to ask him oneday, probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, whether Monsieur wassure that he was not committing an indiscretion, to a certain extent, inleaving his door unfastened day and night, at the mercy of any one whoshould choose to enter, and whether, in short, he did not fear lest somemisfortune might occur in a house so little guarded. The Bishop touchedhis shoulder, with gentle gravity, and said to him, <i>&ldquo;Nisi Dominuscustodierit domum, in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam,&rdquo; Unless the Lordguard the house, in vain do they watch who guard it.</i></p><p>Then he spoke of something else.</p><p>He was fond of saying, &ldquo;There is a bravery of the priest as well as thebravery of a colonel of dragoons,&mdash;only,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;ours must betranquil.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0007" id="link2HCH0007"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;CRAVATTE</h3><p>It is here that a fact falls naturally into place, which we must not omit,because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a man theBishop of D&mdash;&mdash; was.</p><p>After the destruction of the band of Gaspard Bès, who had infested thegorges of Ollioules, one of his lieutenants, Cravatte, took refuge in themountains. He concealed himself for some time with his bandits, theremnant of Gaspard Bès&rsquo;s troop, in the county of Nice; then he made hisway to Piédmont, and suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinity ofBarcelonette. He was first seen at Jauziers, then at Tuiles. He hidhimself in the caverns of the Joug-de-l&rsquo;Aigle, and thence he descendedtowards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of Ubaye andUbayette.</p><p>He even pushed as far as Embrun, entered the cathedral one night, anddespoiled the sacristy. His highway robberies laid waste the country-side.The gendarmes were set on his track, but in vain. He always escaped;sometimes he resisted by main force. He was a bold wretch. In the midst ofall this terror the Bishop arrived. He was making his circuit toChastelar. The mayor came to meet him, and urged him to retrace his steps.Cravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as Arche, and beyond;there was danger even with an escort; it merely exposed three or fourunfortunate gendarmes to no purpose.</p><p>&ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;I intend to go without escort.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do not really mean that, Monseigneur!&rdquo; exclaimed the mayor.</p><p>&ldquo;I do mean it so thoroughly that I absolutely refuse any gendarmes, andshall set out in an hour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Set out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Set out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monseigneur, you will not do that!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There exists yonder in the mountains,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;a tiny communityno bigger than that, which I have not seen for three years. They are mygood friends, those gentle and honest shepherds. They own one goat out ofevery thirty that they tend. They make very pretty woollen cords ofvarious colors, and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with sixholes. They need to be told of the good God now and then. What would theysay to a bishop who was afraid? What would they say if I did not go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the brigands, Monseigneur?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;I must think of that. You are right. I may meetthem. They, too, need to be told of the good God.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, Monseigneur, there is a band of them! A flock of wolves!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le maire, it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves thatJesus has constituted me the shepherd. Who knows the ways of Providence?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They will rob you, Monseigneur.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They will kill you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;An old goodman of a priest, who passes along mumbling his prayers? Bah!To what purpose?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, mon Dieu! what if you should meet them!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should beg alms of them for my poor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do not go, Monseigneur. In the name of Heaven! You are risking yourlife!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le maire,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;is that really all? I am not in theworld to guard my own life, but to guard souls.&rdquo;</p><p>They had to allow him to do as he pleased. He set out, accompanied only bya child who offered to serve as a guide. His obstinacy was bruited aboutthe country-side, and caused great consternation.</p><p>He would take neither his sister nor Madame Magloire. He traversed themountain on mule-back, encountered no one, and arrived safe and sound atthe residence of his &ldquo;good friends,&rdquo; the shepherds. He remained there fora fortnight, preaching, administering the sacrament, teaching, exhorting.When the time of his departure approached, he resolved to chant a <i>TeDeum</i> pontifically. He mentioned it to the curé. But what was to bedone? There were no episcopal ornaments. They could only place at hisdisposal a wretched village sacristy, with a few ancient chasubles ofthreadbare damask adorned with imitation lace.</p><p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said the Bishop. &ldquo;Let us announce our <i>Te Deum</i> from thepulpit, nevertheless, Monsieur le Curé. Things will arrange themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>They instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. All themagnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed toclothe the chorister of a cathedral properly.</p><p>While they were thus embarrassed, a large chest was brought and depositedin the presbytery for the Bishop, by two unknown horsemen, who departed onthe instant. The chest was opened; it contained a cope of cloth of gold, amitre ornamented with diamonds, an archbishop&rsquo;s cross, a magnificentcrosier,&mdash;all the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a monthpreviously from the treasury of Notre Dame d&rsquo;Embrun. In the chest was apaper, on which these words were written, <i>&ldquo;From Cravatte to MonseigneurBienvenu.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Did not I say that things would come right of themselves?&rdquo; said theBishop. Then he added, with a smile, &ldquo;To him who contents himself with thesurplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; murmured the curé, throwing back his head with a smile.&ldquo;God&mdash;or the Devil.&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop looked steadily at the curé, and repeated with authority,&ldquo;God!&rdquo;</p><p>When he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as at acuriosity, all along the road. At the priest&rsquo;s house in Chastelar herejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire, who were waiting forhim, and he said to his sister: &ldquo;Well! was I in the right? The poor priestwent to his poor mountaineers with empty hands, and he returns from themwith his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith in God; I havebrought back the treasure of a cathedral.&rdquo;</p><p>That evening, before he went to bed, he said again: &ldquo;Let us never fearrobbers nor murderers. Those are dangers from without, petty dangers. Letus fear ourselves. Prejudices are the real robbers; vices are the realmurderers. The great dangers lie within ourselves. What matters it whatthreatens our head or our purse! Let us think only of that which threatensour soul.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, turning to his sister: &ldquo;Sister, never a precaution on the part ofthe priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, Godpermits. Let us confine ourselves to prayer, when we think that a dangeris approaching us. Let us pray, not for ourselves, but that our brothermay not fall into sin on our account.&rdquo;</p><p>However, such incidents were rare in his life. We relate those of which weknow; but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at thesame moment. One month of his year resembled one hour of his day.</p><p>As to what became of &ldquo;the treasure&rdquo; of the cathedral of Embrun, we shouldbe embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction. It consisted of veryhandsome things, very tempting things, and things which were very welladapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate. Stolen they hadalready been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed; it onlyremained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause it to take ashort trip in the direction of the poor. However, we make no assertions onthis point. Only, a rather obscure note was found among the Bishop&rsquo;spapers, which may bear some relation to this matter, and which is couchedin these terms, <i>&ldquo;The question is, to decide whether this should beturned over to the cathedral or to the hospital.&rdquo;</i></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0008" id="link2HCH0008"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;PHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKING</h3><p>The senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made his own way,heedless of those things which present obstacles, and which are calledconscience, sworn faith, justice, duty: he had marched straight to hisgoal, without once flinching in the line of his advancement and hisinterest. He was an old attorney, softened by success; not a bad man byany means, who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons,his sons-in-law, his relations, and even to his friends, having wiselyseized upon, in life, good sides, good opportunities, good windfalls.Everything else seemed to him very stupid. He was intelligent, and justsufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus; while hewas, in reality, only a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He laughed willinglyand pleasantly over infinite and eternal things, and at the &ldquo;crotchets ofthat good old fellow the Bishop.&rdquo; He even sometimes laughed at him with anamiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself, who listened tohim.</p><p>On some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what, Count***[this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect. At dessert,the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though still perfectlydignified, exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Egad, Bishop, let&rsquo;s have a discussion. It is hard for a senator and abishop to look at each other without winking. We are two augurs. I amgoing to make a confession to you. I have a philosophy of my own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you are right,&rdquo; replied the Bishop. &ldquo;As one makes one&rsquo;s philosophy,so one lies on it. You are on the bed of purple, senator.&rdquo;</p><p>The senator was encouraged, and went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us be good fellows.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good devils even,&rdquo; said the Bishop.</p><p>&ldquo;I declare to you,&rdquo; continued the senator, &ldquo;that the Marquis d&rsquo;Argens,Pyrrhon, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are no rascals. I have all thephilosophers in my library gilded on the edges.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like yourself, Count,&rdquo; interposed the Bishop.</p><p>The senator resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I hate Diderot; he is an ideologist, a declaimer, and a revolutionist, abeliever in God at bottom, and more bigoted than Voltaire. Voltaire madesport of Needham, and he was wrong, for Needham&rsquo;s eels prove that God isuseless. A drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the <i>fiatlux</i>. Suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger; you havethe world. Man is the eel. Then what is the good of the Eternal Father?The Jehovah hypothesis tires me, Bishop. It is good for nothing but toproduce shallow people, whose reasoning is hollow. Down with that greatAll, which torments me! Hurrah for Zero which leaves me in peace! Betweenyou and me, and in order to empty my sack, and make confession to mypastor, as it behooves me to do, I will admit to you that I have goodsense. I am not enthusiastic over your Jesus, who preaches renunciationand sacrifice to the last extremity. &rsquo;Tis the counsel of an avaricious manto beggars. Renunciation; why? Sacrifice; to what end? I do not see onewolf immolating himself for the happiness of another wolf. Let us stick tonature, then. We are at the top; let us have a superior philosophy. Whatis the advantage of being at the top, if one sees no further than the endof other people&rsquo;s noses? Let us live merrily. Life is all. That man hasanother future elsewhere, on high, below, anywhere, I don&rsquo;t believe; notone single word of it. Ah! sacrifice and renunciation are recommended tome; I must take heed to everything I do; I must cudgel my brains over goodand evil, over the just and the unjust, over the <i>fas</i> and the <i>nefas</i>.Why? Because I shall have to render an account of my actions. When? Afterdeath. What a fine dream! After my death it will be a very clever personwho can catch me. Have a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand, if youcan. Let us tell the truth, we who are initiated, and who have raised theveil of Isis: there is no such thing as either good or evil; there isvegetation. Let us seek the real. Let us get to the bottom of it. Let usgo into it thoroughly. What the deuce! let us go to the bottom of it! Wemust scent out the truth; dig in the earth for it, and seize it. Then itgives you exquisite joys. Then you grow strong, and you laugh. I am squareon the bottom, I am. Immortality, Bishop, is a chance, a waiting for deadmen&rsquo;s shoes. Ah! what a charming promise! trust to it, if you like! What afine lot Adam has! We are souls, and we shall be angels, with blue wingson our shoulder-blades. Do come to my assistance: is it not Tertullian whosays that the blessed shall travel from star to star? Very well. We shallbe the grasshoppers of the stars. And then, besides, we shall see God. Ta,ta, ta! What twaddle all these paradises are! God is a nonsensicalmonster. I would not say that in the <i>Moniteur</i>, egad! but I maywhisper it among friends. <i>Inter pocula</i>. To sacrifice the world toparadise is to let slip the prey for the shadow. Be the dupe of theinfinite! I&rsquo;m not such a fool. I am a nought. I call myself Monsieur leComte Nought, senator. Did I exist before my birth? No. Shall I existafter death? No. What am I? A little dust collected in an organism. Whatam I to do on this earth? The choice rests with me: suffer or enjoy.Whither will suffering lead me? To nothingness; but I shall have suffered.Whither will enjoyment lead me? To nothingness; but I shall have enjoyedmyself. My choice is made. One must eat or be eaten. I shall eat. It isbetter to be the tooth than the grass. Such is my wisdom. After which, gowhither I push thee, the grave-digger is there; the Pantheon for some ofus: all falls into the great hole. End. <i>Finis</i>. Total liquidation.This is the vanishing-point. Death is death, believe me. I laugh at theidea of there being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject.Fables of nurses; bugaboo for children; Jehovah for men. No; our to-morrowis the night. Beyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness. Youhave been Sardanapalus, you have been Vincent de Paul&mdash;it makes nodifference. That is the truth. Then live your life, above all things. Makeuse of your <i>I</i> while you have it. In truth, Bishop, I tell you thatI have a philosophy of my own, and I have my philosophers. I don&rsquo;t letmyself be taken in with that nonsense. Of course, there must be somethingfor those who are down,&mdash;for the barefooted beggars, knife-grinders,and miserable wretches. Legends, chimæras, the soul, immortality,paradise, the stars, are provided for them to swallow. They gobble itdown. They spread it on their dry bread. He who has nothing else has thegood God. That is the least he can have. I oppose no objection to that;but I reserve Monsieur Naigeon for myself. The good God is good for thepopulace.&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop clapped his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s talking!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What an excellent and really marvellousthing is this materialism! Not every one who wants it can have it. Ah!when one does have it, one is no longer a dupe, one does not stupidlyallow one&rsquo;s self to be exiled like Cato, nor stoned like Stephen, norburned alive like Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc. Those who have succeeded in procuring thisadmirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible,and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness,&mdash;places,sinecures, dignities, power, whether well or ill acquired, lucrativerecantations, useful treacheries, savory capitulations of conscience,&mdash;andthat they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished. Howagreeable that is! I do not say that with reference to you, senator.Nevertheless, it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you.You great lords have, so you say, a philosophy of your own, and foryourselves, which is exquisite, refined, accessible to the rich alone,good for all sauces, and which seasons the voluptuousness of lifeadmirably. This philosophy has been extracted from the depths, andunearthed by special seekers. But you are good-natured princes, and you donot think it a bad thing that belief in the good God should constitute thephilosophy of the people, very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts isthe truffled turkey of the poor.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0009" id="link2HCH0009"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE BROTHER AS DEPICTED BY THE SISTER</h3><p>In order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the Bishop ofD&mdash;&mdash;, and of the manner in which those two sainted womensubordinated their actions, their thoughts, their feminine instincts even,which are easily alarmed, to the habits and purposes of the Bishop,without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them,we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter fromMademoiselle Baptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron, the friendof her childhood. This letter is in our possession.</p><p class="right">D&mdash;&mdash;, Dec. 16, 18&mdash;.</p><p class="letter">M<small>Y</small> G<small>OOD</small> M<small>ADAM</small>: Not a day passeswithout our speaking of you. It is our established custom; but there is anotherreason besides. Just imagine, while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls,Madam Magloire has made some discoveries; now our two chambers hung withantique paper whitewashed over, would not discredit a château in the style ofyours. Madam Magloire has pulled off all the paper. There were things beneath.My drawing-room, which contains no furniture, and which we use for spreadingout the linen after washing, is fifteen feet in height, eighteen square, with aceiling which was formerly painted and gilded, and with beams, as in yours.This was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital. And the woodwork wasof the era of our grandmothers. But my room is the one you ought to see. MadamMagloire has discovered, under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top,some paintings, which without being good are very tolerable. The subject isTelemachus being knighted by Minerva in some gardens, the name of which escapesme. In short, where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night. What shall Isay to you? I have Romans, and Roman ladies [here occurs an illegible word],and the whole train. Madam Magloire has cleaned it all off; this summer she isgoing to have some small injuries repaired, and the whole revarnished, and mychamber will be a regular museum. She has also found in a corner of the attictwo wooden pier-tables of ancient fashion. They asked us two crowns of sixfrancs each to regild them, but it is much better to give the money to thepoor; and they are very ugly besides, and I should much prefer a round table ofmahogany.<br/>    I am always very happy. My brother is so good. He gives all he has tothe poor and sick. We are very much cramped. The country is trying inthe winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need.We are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these aregreat treats.<br/>    My brother has ways of his own. When he talks, he says that a bishopought to be so. Just imagine! the door of our house is never fastened.Whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother&rsquo;s room. Hefears nothing, even at night. That is his sort of bravery, he says.<br/>    He does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him. He exposeshimself to all sorts of dangers, and he does not like to have us evenseem to notice it. One must know how to understand him.<br/>    He goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels in winter. Hefears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, nor night.<br/>    Last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers. He wouldnot take us. He was absent for a fortnight. On his return nothing hadhappened to him; he was thought to be dead, but was perfectly well, andsaid, &ldquo;This is the way I have been robbed!&rdquo; And then he opened a trunkfull of jewels, all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun, which thethieves had given him.<br/>    When he returned on that occasion, I could not refrain from scolding hima little, taking care, however, not to speak except when the carriagewas making a noise, so that no one might hear me.<br/>    At first I used to say to myself, &ldquo;There are no dangers which will stophim; he is terrible.&rdquo; Now I have ended by getting used to it. I make asign to Madam Magloire that she is not to oppose him. He risks himselfas he sees fit. I carry off Madam Magloire, I enter my chamber, I prayfor him and fall asleep. I am at ease, because I know that if anythingwere to happen to him, it would be the end of me. I should go to thegood God with my brother and my bishop. It has cost Madam Magloiremore trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms hisimprudences. But now the habit has been acquired. We pray together, wetremble together, and we fall asleep. If the devil were to enter thishouse, he would be allowed to do so. After all, what is there for usto fear in this house? There is always some one with us who is strongerthan we. The devil may pass through it, but the good God dwells here.<br/>    This suffices me. My brother has no longer any need of saying a word tome. I understand him without his speaking, and we abandon ourselves tothe care of Providence. That is the way one has to do with a man whopossesses grandeur of soul.<br/>    I have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which youdesire on the subject of the Faux family. You are aware that he knowseverything, and that he has memories, because he is still a verygood royalist. They really are a very ancient Norman family of thegeneralship of Caen. Five hundred years ago there was a Raoul de Faux, aJean de Faux, and a Thomas de Faux, who were gentlemen, and one of whomwas a seigneur de Rochefort. The last was Guy-Étienne-Alexandre, and wascommander of a regiment, and something in the light horse of Bretagne.His daughter, Marie-Louise, married Adrien-Charles de Gramont, son ofthe Duke Louis de Gramont, peer of France, colonel of the French guards,and lieutenant-general of the army. It is written Faux, Fauq, andFaoucq.<br/>    Good Madame, recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative,Monsieur the Cardinal. As for your dear Sylvanie, she has done well innot wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me.She is well, works as you would wish, and loves me.<br/>    That is all that I desire. The souvenir which she sent through youreached me safely, and it makes me very happy. My health is not so verybad, and yet I grow thinner every day. Farewell; my paper is at an end,and this forces me to leave you. A thousand good wishes.</p><p class="right">B<small>APTISTINE</small>.</p><p class="letter">P.S. Your grand nephew is charming. Do you know that he will soon befive years old? Yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback whohad on knee-caps, and he said, &ldquo;What has he got on his knees?&rdquo; He is acharming child! His little brother is dragging an old broom about theroom, like a carriage, and saying, &ldquo;Hu!&rdquo;</p><p>As will be perceived from this letter, these two women understood how tomould themselves to the Bishop&rsquo;s ways with that special feminine geniuswhich comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself. The Bishopof D&mdash;&mdash;, in spite of the gentle and candid air which neverdeserted him, sometimes did things that were grand, bold, and magnificent,without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact. They trembled, butthey let him alone. Sometimes Madame Magloire essayed a remonstrance inadvance, but never at the time, nor afterwards. They never interfered withhim by so much as a word or sign, in any action once entered upon. Atcertain moments, without his having occasion to mention it, when he wasnot even conscious of it himself in all probability, so perfect was hissimplicity, they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop; then theywere nothing more than two shadows in the house. They served himpassively; and if obedience consisted in disappearing, they disappeared.They understood, with an admirable delicacy of instinct, that certaincares may be put under constraint. Thus, even when believing him to be inperil, they understood, I will not say his thought, but his nature, tosuch a degree that they no longer watched over him. They confided him toGod.</p><p>Moreover, Baptistine said, as we have just read, that her brother&rsquo;s endwould prove her own. Madame Magloire did not say this, but she knew it.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0010" id="link2HCH0010"></a>CHAPTER X&mdash;THE BISHOP IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNKNOWN LIGHT</h3><p>At an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in thepreceding pages, he did a thing which, if the whole town was to bebelieved, was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountainsinfested with bandits.</p><p>In the country near D&mdash;&mdash; a man lived quite alone. This man, wewill state at once, was a former member of the Convention. His name was G&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>Member of the Convention, G&mdash;&mdash; was mentioned with a sort ofhorror in the little world of D&mdash;&mdash; A member of the Convention&mdash;canyou imagine such a thing? That existed from the time when people calledeach other <i>thou</i>, and when they said &ldquo;citizen.&rdquo; This man was almosta monster. He had not voted for the death of the king, but almost. He wasa quasi-regicide. He had been a terrible man. How did it happen that sucha man had not been brought before a provost&rsquo;s court, on the return of thelegitimate princes? They need not have cut off his head, if you please;clemency must be exercised, agreed; but a good banishment for life. Anexample, in short, etc. Besides, he was an atheist, like all the rest ofthose people. Gossip of the geese about the vulture.</p><p>Was G&mdash;&mdash; a vulture after all? Yes; if he were to be judged bythe element of ferocity in this solitude of his. As he had not voted forthe death of the king, he had not been included in the decrees of exile,and had been able to remain in France.</p><p>He dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, farfrom any hamlet, far from any road, in some hidden turn of a very wildvalley, no one knew exactly where. He had there, it was said, a sort offield, a hole, a lair. There were no neighbors, not even passers-by. Sincehe had dwelt in that valley, the path which led thither had disappearedunder a growth of grass. The locality was spoken of as though it had beenthe dwelling of a hangman.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Bishop meditated on the subject, and from time to timehe gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked thevalley of the former member of the Convention, and he said, &ldquo;There is asoul yonder which is lonely.&rdquo;</p><p>And he added, deep in his own mind, &ldquo;I owe him a visit.&rdquo;</p><p>But, let us avow it, this idea, which seemed natural at the first blush,appeared to him after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, as strange, impossible, andalmost repulsive. For, at bottom, he shared the general impression, andthe old member of the Convention inspired him, without his being clearlyconscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment which borders on hate,and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement.</p><p>Still, should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil? No. Butwhat a sheep!</p><p>The good Bishop was perplexed. Sometimes he set out in that direction;then he returned.</p><p>Finally, the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of youngshepherd, who served the member of the Convention in his hovel, had comein quest of a doctor; that the old wretch was dying, that paralysis wasgaining on him, and that he would not live over night.&mdash;&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; some added.</p><p>The Bishop took his staff, put on his cloak, on account of his toothreadbare cassock, as we have mentioned, and because of the eveningbreeze which was sure to rise soon, and set out.</p><p>The sun was setting, and had almost touched the horizon when the Bishoparrived at the excommunicated spot. With a certain beating of the heart,he recognized the fact that he was near the lair. He strode over a ditch,leaped a hedge, made his way through a fence of dead boughs, entered aneglected paddock, took a few steps with a good deal of boldness, andsuddenly, at the extremity of the waste land, and behind lofty brambles,he caught sight of the cavern.</p><p>It was a very low hut, poor, small, and clean, with a vine nailed againstthe outside.</p><p>Near the door, in an old wheel-chair, the armchair of the peasants, therewas a white-haired man, smiling at the sun.</p><p>Near the seated man stood a young boy, the shepherd lad. He was offeringthe old man a jar of milk.</p><p>While the Bishop was watching him, the old man spoke: &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; hesaid, &ldquo;I need nothing.&rdquo; And his smile quitted the sun to rest upon thechild.</p><p>The Bishop stepped forward. At the sound which he made in walking, the oldman turned his head, and his face expressed the sum total of the surprisewhich a man can still feel after a long life.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the first time since I have been here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that any onehas entered here. Who are you, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop answered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Bienvenu Myriel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bienvenu Myriel? I have heard that name. Are you the man whom the peoplecall Monseigneur Welcome?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p><p>The old man resumed with a half-smile</p><p>&ldquo;In that case, you are my bishop?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something of that sort.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Enter, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>The member of the Convention extended his hand to the Bishop, but theBishop did not take it. The Bishop confined himself to the remark:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am pleased to see that I have been misinformed. You certainly do notseem to me to be ill.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the old man, &ldquo;I am going to recover.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused, and then said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall die three hours hence.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am something of a doctor; I know in what fashion the last hour drawson. Yesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill has ascended tomy knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the heart, Ishall stop. The sun is beautiful, is it not? I had myself wheeled out hereto take a last look at things. You can talk to me; it does not fatigue me.You have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death.It is well that there should be witnesses at that moment. One has one&rsquo;scaprices; I should have liked to last until the dawn, but I know that Ishall hardly live three hours. It will be night then. What does it matter,after all? Dying is a simple affair. One has no need of the light forthat. So be it. I shall die by starlight.&rdquo;</p><p>The old man turned to the shepherd lad:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Go to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired.&rdquo;</p><p>The child entered the hut.</p><p>The old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as though speaking tohimself:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall die while he sleeps. The two slumbers may be good neighbors.&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He didnot think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the whole,for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like therest: he, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at &ldquo;His Grace,&rdquo; wasrather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he was almosttempted to retort &ldquo;citizen.&rdquo; He was assailed by a fancy for peevishfamiliarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but which was nothabitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the Convention,this representative of the people, had been one of the powerful ones ofthe earth; for the first time in his life, probably, the Bishop felt in amood to be severe.</p><p>Meanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with amodest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly, thathumility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning todust.</p><p>The Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his curiosity,which, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could not refrain fromexamining the member of the Convention with an attention which, as it didnot have its course in sympathy, would have served his conscience as amatter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A member of theConvention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the paleof the law, even of the law of charity. G&mdash;&mdash;, calm, his bodyalmost upright, his voice vibrating, was one of those octogenarians whoform the subject of astonishment to the physiologist. The Revolution hadmany of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In this old man one wasconscious of a man put to the proof. Though so near to his end, hepreserved all the gestures of health. In his clear glance, in his firmtone, in the robust movement of his shoulders, there was somethingcalculated to disconcert death. Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of thesepulchre, would have turned back, and thought that he had mistaken thedoor. G&mdash;&mdash; seemed to be dying because he willed it so. Therewas freedom in his agony. His legs alone were motionless. It was therethat the shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and dead, but his headsurvived with all the power of life, and seemed full of light. G&mdash;&mdash;,at this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale of the Orient whowas flesh above and marble below.</p><p>There was a stone there. The Bishop sat down. The exordium was abrupt.</p><p>&ldquo;I congratulate you,&rdquo; said he, in the tone which one uses for a reprimand.&ldquo;You did not vote for the death of the king, after all.&rdquo;</p><p>The old member of the Convention did not appear to notice the bittermeaning underlying the words &ldquo;after all.&rdquo; He replied. The smile had quitedisappeared from his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Do not congratulate me too much, sir. I did vote for the death of thetyrant.&rdquo;</p><p>It was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean to say?&rdquo; resumed the Bishop.</p><p>&ldquo;I mean to say that man has a tyrant,&mdash;ignorance. I voted for thedeath of that tyrant. That tyrant engendered royalty, which is authorityfalsely understood, while science is authority rightly understood. Manshould be governed only by science.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And conscience,&rdquo; added the Bishop.</p><p>&ldquo;It is the same thing. Conscience is the quantity of innate science whichwe have within us.&rdquo;</p><p>Monseigneur Bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language, whichwas very new to him.</p><p>The member of the Convention resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;So far as Louis XVI. was concerned, I said &lsquo;no.&rsquo; I did not think that Ihad the right to kill a man; but I felt it my duty to exterminate evil. Ivoted the end of the tyrant, that is to say, the end of prostitution forwoman, the end of slavery for man, the end of night for the child. Invoting for the Republic, I voted for that. I voted for fraternity,concord, the dawn. I have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors.The crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light. We have causedthe fall of the old world, and the old world, that vase of miseries, hasbecome, through its upsetting upon the human race, an urn of joy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mixed joy,&rdquo; said the Bishop.</p><p>&ldquo;You may say troubled joy, and to-day, after that fatal return of thepast, which is called 1814, joy which has disappeared! Alas! The work wasincomplete, I admit: we demolished the ancient regime in deeds; we werenot able to suppress it entirely in ideas. To destroy abuses is notsufficient; customs must be modified. The mill is there no longer; thewind is still there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have demolished. It may be of use to demolish, but I distrust ademolition complicated with wrath.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Right has its wrath, Bishop; and the wrath of right is an element ofprogress. In any case, and in spite of whatever may be said, the FrenchRevolution is the most important step of the human race since the adventof Christ. Incomplete, it may be, but sublime. It set free all the unknownsocial quantities; it softened spirits, it calmed, appeased, enlightened;it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth. It was a goodthing. The French Revolution is the consecration of humanity.&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop could not refrain from murmuring:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes? &rsquo;93!&rdquo;</p><p>The member of the Convention straightened himself up in his chair with analmost lugubrious solemnity, and exclaimed, so far as a dying man iscapable of exclamation:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, there you go; &rsquo;93! I was expecting that word. A cloud had beenforming for the space of fifteen hundred years; at the end of fifteenhundred years it burst. You are putting the thunderbolt on its trial.&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop felt, without, perhaps, confessing it, that something withinhim had suffered extinction. Nevertheless, he put a good face on thematter. He replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The judge speaks in the name of justice; the priest speaks in the name ofpity, which is nothing but a more lofty justice. A thunderbolt shouldcommit no error.&rdquo; And he added, regarding the member of the Conventionsteadily the while, &ldquo;Louis XVII.?&rdquo;</p><p>The conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the Bishop&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Louis XVII.! let us see. For whom do you mourn? is it for the innocentchild? very good; in that case I mourn with you. Is it for the royalchild? I demand time for reflection. To me, the brother of Cartouche, aninnocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the Place de Grève, untildeath ensued, for the sole crime of having been the brother of Cartouche,is no less painful than the grandson of Louis XV., an innocent child,martyred in the tower of the Temple, for the sole crime of having beengrandson of Louis XV.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;I like not this conjunction of names.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cartouche? Louis XV.? To which of the two do you object?&rdquo;</p><p>A momentary silence ensued. The Bishop almost regretted having come, andyet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken.</p><p>The conventionary resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Monsieur Priest, you love not the crudities of the true. Christ lovedthem. He seized a rod and cleared out the Temple. His scourge, full oflightnings, was a harsh speaker of truths. When he cried, <i>&lsquo;Siniteparvulos,&rsquo;</i> he made no distinction between the little children. Itwould not have embarrassed him to bring together the Dauphin of Barabbasand the Dauphin of Herod. Innocence, Monsieur, is its own crown. Innocencehas no need to be a highness. It is as august in rags as in fleurs delys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the Bishop in a low voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I persist,&rdquo; continued the conventionary G&mdash;&mdash; &ldquo;You havementioned Louis XVII. to me. Let us come to an understanding. Shall weweep for all the innocent, all martyrs, all children, the lowly as well asthe exalted? I agree to that. But in that case, as I have told you, wemust go back further than &rsquo;93, and our tears must begin before Louis XVII.I will weep with you over the children of kings, provided that you willweep with me over the children of the people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I weep for all,&rdquo; said the Bishop.</p><p>&ldquo;Equally!&rdquo; exclaimed conventionary G&mdash;&mdash;; &ldquo;and if the balancemust incline, let it be on the side of the people. They have beensuffering longer.&rdquo;</p><p>Another silence ensued. The conventionary was the first to break it. Heraised himself on one elbow, took a bit of his cheek between his thumb andhis forefinger, as one does mechanically when one interrogates and judges,and appealed to the Bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of the deathagony. It was almost an explosion.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, the people have been suffering a long while. And hold! that isnot all, either; why have you just questioned me and talked to me aboutLouis XVII.? I know you not. Ever since I have been in these parts I havedwelt in this enclosure alone, never setting foot outside, and seeing noone but that child who helps me. Your name has reached me in a confusedmanner, it is true, and very badly pronounced, I must admit; but thatsignifies nothing: clever men have so many ways of imposing on that honestgoodman, the people. By the way, I did not hear the sound of yourcarriage; you have left it yonder, behind the coppice at the fork of theroads, no doubt. I do not know you, I tell you. You have told me that youare the Bishop; but that affords me no information as to your moralpersonality. In short, I repeat my question. Who are you? You are abishop; that is to say, a prince of the church, one of those gilded menwith heraldic bearings and revenues, who have vast prebends,&mdash;thebishopric of D&mdash;&mdash; fifteen thousand francs settled income, tenthousand in perquisites; total, twenty-five thousand francs,&mdash;whohave kitchens, who have liveries, who make good cheer, who eat moor-henson Friday, who strut about, a lackey before, a lackey behind, in a galacoach, and who have palaces, and who roll in their carriages in the nameof Jesus Christ who went barefoot! You are a prelate,&mdash;revenues,palace, horses, servants, good table, all the sensualities of life; youhave this like the rest, and like the rest, you enjoy it; it is well; butthis says either too much or too little; this does not enlighten me uponthe intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probableintention of bringing wisdom to me. To whom do I speak? Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop hung his head and replied, <i>&ldquo;Vermis sum</i>&mdash;I am aworm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A worm of the earth in a carriage?&rdquo; growled the conventionary.</p><p>It was the conventionary&rsquo;s turn to be arrogant, and the Bishop&rsquo;s to behumble.</p><p>The Bishop resumed mildly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;So be it, sir. But explain to me how my carriage, which is a few pacesoff behind the trees yonder, how my good table and the moor-hens which Ieat on Friday, how my twenty-five thousand francs income, how my palaceand my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty, and that &rsquo;93 was notinexorable.&rdquo;</p><p>The conventionary passed his hand across his brow, as though to sweep awaya cloud.</p><p>&ldquo;Before replying to you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I beseech you to pardon me. I havejust committed a wrong, sir. You are at my house, you are my guest, I oweyou courtesy. You discuss my ideas, and it becomes me to confine myself tocombating your arguments. Your riches and your pleasures are advantageswhich I hold over you in the debate; but good taste dictates that I shallnot make use of them. I promise you to make no use of them in the future.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said the Bishop.</p><p>G&mdash;&mdash; resumed.</p><p>&ldquo;Let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me. Where werewe? What were you saying to me? That &rsquo;93 was inexorable?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Inexorable; yes,&rdquo; said the Bishop. &ldquo;What think you of Marat clapping hishands at the guillotine?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What think you of Bossuet chanting the <i>Te Deum</i> over thedragonnades?&rdquo;</p><p>The retort was a harsh one, but it attained its mark with the directnessof a point of steel. The Bishop quivered under it; no reply occurred tohim; but he was offended by this mode of alluding to Bossuet. The best ofminds will have their fetiches, and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded bythe want of respect of logic.</p><p>The conventionary began to pant; the asthma of the agony which is mingledwith the last breaths interrupted his voice; still, there was a perfectlucidity of soul in his eyes. He went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me say a few words more in this and that direction; I am willing.Apart from the Revolution, which, taken as a whole, is an immense humanaffirmation, &rsquo;93 is, alas! a rejoinder. You think it inexorable, sir; butwhat of the whole monarchy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; but what name do yougive to Montrevel? Fouquier-Tainville is a rascal; but what is youropinion as to Lamoignon-Bâville? Maillard is terrible; but Saulx-Tavannes,if you please? Duchêne senior is ferocious; but what epithet will youallow me for the elder Letellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tetê is a monster; but notso great a one as M. the Marquis de Louvois. Sir, sir, I am sorry forMarie Antoinette, archduchess and queen; but I am also sorry for that poorHuguenot woman, who, in 1685, under Louis the Great, sir, while with anursing infant, was bound, naked to the waist, to a stake, and the childkept at a distance; her breast swelled with milk and her heart withanguish; the little one, hungry and pale, beheld that breast and cried andagonized; the executioner said to the woman, a mother and a nurse,‘Abjure!&rsquo; giving her her choice between the death of her infant and thedeath of her conscience. What say you to that torture of Tantalus asapplied to a mother? Bear this well in mind sir: the French Revolution hadits reasons for existence; its wrath will be absolved by the future; itsresult is the world made better. From its most terrible blows there comesforth a caress for the human race. I abridge, I stop, I have too much theadvantage; moreover, I am dying.&rdquo;</p><p>And ceasing to gaze at the Bishop, the conventionary concluded histhoughts in these tranquil words:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, the brutalities of progress are called revolutions. When they areover, this fact is recognized,&mdash;that the human race has been treatedharshly, but that it has progressed.&rdquo;</p><p>The conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all theinmost intrenchments of the Bishop. One remained, however, and from thisintrenchment, the last resource of Monseigneur Bienvenu&rsquo;s resistance, cameforth this reply, wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of thebeginning:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Progress should believe in God. Good cannot have an impious servitor. Hewho is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race.&rdquo;</p><p>The former representative of the people made no reply. He was seized witha fit of trembling. He looked towards heaven, and in his glance a teargathered slowly. When the eyelid was full, the tear trickled down hislivid cheek, and he said, almost in a stammer, quite low, and to himself,while his eyes were plunged in the depths:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;O thou! O ideal! Thou alone existest!&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop experienced an indescribable shock.</p><p>After a pause, the old man raised a finger heavenward and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The infinite is. He is there. If the infinite had no person, person wouldbe without limit; it would not be infinite; in other words, it would notexist. There is, then, an <i>I</i>. That <i>I</i> of the infinite is God.&rdquo;</p><p>The dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice, and withthe shiver of ecstasy, as though he beheld some one. When he had spoken,his eyes closed. The effort had exhausted him. It was evident that he hadjust lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him.That which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death. Thesupreme moment was approaching.</p><p>The Bishop understood this; time pressed; it was as a priest that he hadcome: from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion;he gazed at those closed eyes, he took that wrinkled, aged and ice-coldhand in his, and bent over the dying man.</p><p>&ldquo;This hour is the hour of God. Do you not think that it would beregrettable if we had met in vain?&rdquo;</p><p>The conventionary opened his eyes again. A gravity mingled with gloom wasimprinted on his countenance.</p><p>&ldquo;Bishop,&rdquo; said he, with a slowness which probably arose more from hisdignity of soul than from the failing of his strength, &ldquo;I have passed mylife in meditation, study, and contemplation. I was sixty years of agewhen my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with itsaffairs. I obeyed. Abuses existed, I combated them; tyrannies existed, Idestroyed them; rights and principles existed, I proclaimed and confessedthem. Our territory was invaded, I defended it; France was menaced, Ioffered my breast. I was not rich; I am poor. I have been one of themasters of the state; the vaults of the treasury were encumbered withspecie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls, whichwere on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and silver; Idined in Dead Tree Street, at twenty-two sous. I have succored theoppressed, I have comforted the suffering. I tore the cloth from thealtar, it is true; but it was to bind up the wounds of my country. I havealways upheld the march forward of the human race, forward towards thelight, and I have sometimes resisted progress without pity. I have, whenthe occasion offered, protected my own adversaries, men of yourprofession. And there is at Peteghem, in Flanders, at the very spot wherethe Merovingian kings had their summer palace, a convent of Urbanists, theAbbey of Sainte Claire en Beaulieu, which I saved in 1793. I have done myduty according to my powers, and all the good that I was able. Afterwhich, I was hunted down, pursued, persecuted, blackened, jeered at,scorned, cursed, proscribed. For many years past, I with my white hairhave been conscious that many people think they have the right to despiseme; to the poor ignorant masses I present the visage of one damned. And Iaccept this isolation of hatred, without hating any one myself. Now I ameighty-six years old; I am on the point of death. What is it that you havecome to ask of me?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Your blessing,&rdquo;</i> said the Bishop.</p><p>And he knelt down.</p><p>When the Bishop raised his head again, the face of the conventionary hadbecome august. He had just expired.</p><p>The Bishop returned home, deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot beknown to us. He passed the whole night in prayer. On the following morningsome bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about member ofthe Convention G&mdash;&mdash;; he contented himself with pointingheavenward.</p><p>From that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towardsall children and sufferers.</p><p>Any allusion to &ldquo;that old wretch of a G&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; caused him to fallinto a singular preoccupation. No one could say that the passage of thatsoul before his, and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his, didnot count for something in his approach to perfection.</p><p>This &ldquo;pastoral visit&rdquo; naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur ofcomment in all the little local coteries.</p><p>&ldquo;Was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for abishop? There was evidently no conversion to be expected. All thoserevolutionists are backsliders. Then why go there? What was there to beseen there? He must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carriedoff by the devil.&rdquo;</p><p>One day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself spiritual,addressed this sally to him, &ldquo;Monseigneur, people are inquiring when YourGreatness will receive the red cap!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! oh! that&rsquo;s a coarsecolor,&rdquo; replied the Bishop. &ldquo;It is lucky that those who despise it in acap revere it in a hat.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0011" id="link2HCH0011"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;A RESTRICTION</h3><p>We should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves, were we to concludefrom this that Monseigneur Welcome was &ldquo;a philosophical bishop,&rdquo; or a&ldquo;patriotic curé.&rdquo; His meeting, which may almost be designated as hisunion, with conventionary G&mdash;&mdash;, left behind it in his mind asort of astonishment, which rendered him still more gentle. That is all.</p><p>Although Monseigneur Bienvenu was far from being a politician, this is,perhaps, the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in theevents of that epoch, supposing that Monseigneur Bienvenu ever dreamed ofhaving an attitude.</p><p>Let us, then, go back a few years.</p><p>Some time after the elevation of M. Myriel to the episcopate, the Emperorhad made him a baron of the Empire, in company with many other bishops.The arrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, on the night of the5th to the 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, M. Myriel was summoned byNapoleon to the synod of the bishops of France and Italy convened atParis. This synod was held at Notre-Dame, and assembled for the first timeon the 15th of June, 1811, under the presidency of Cardinal Fesch. M.Myriel was one of the ninety-five bishops who attended it. But he waspresent only at one sitting and at three or four private conferences.Bishop of a mountain diocese, living so very close to nature, in rusticityand deprivation, it appeared that he imported among these eminentpersonages, ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly. He verysoon returned to D&mdash;&mdash; He was interrogated as to this speedyreturn, and he replied: <i>&ldquo;I embarrassed them. The outside air penetratedto them through me. I produced on them the effect of an open door.&rdquo;</i></p><p>On another occasion he said, <i>&ldquo;What would you have? Those gentlemen areprinces. I am only a poor peasant bishop.&rdquo;</i></p><p>The fact is that he displeased them. Among other strange things, it issaid that he chanced to remark one evening, when he found himself at thehouse of one of his most notable colleagues: &ldquo;What beautiful clocks! Whatbeautiful carpets! What beautiful liveries! They must be a great trouble.I would not have all those superfluities, crying incessantly in my ears:‘There are people who are hungry! There are people who are cold! There arepoor people! There are poor people!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Let us remark, by the way, that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligenthatred. This hatred would involve the hatred of the arts. Nevertheless, inchurchmen, luxury is wrong, except in connection with representations andceremonies. It seems to reveal habits which have very little that ischaritable about them. An opulent priest is a contradiction. The priestmust keep close to the poor. Now, can one come in contact incessantlynight and day with all this distress, all these misfortunes, and thispoverty, without having about one&rsquo;s own person a little of that misery,like the dust of labor? Is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier whois not warm? Can one imagine a workman who is working near a furnace, andwho has neither a singed hair, nor blackened nails, nor a drop of sweat,nor a speck of ashes on his face? The first proof of charity in thepriest, in the bishop especially, is poverty.</p><p>This is, no doubt, what the Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash; thought.</p><p>It must not be supposed, however, that he shared what we call the &ldquo;ideasof the century&rdquo; on certain delicate points. He took very little part inthe theological quarrels of the moment, and maintained silence onquestions in which Church and State were implicated; but if he had beenstrongly pressed, it seems that he would have been found to be anultramontane rather than a gallican. Since we are making a portrait, andsince we do not wish to conceal anything, we are forced to add that he wasglacial towards Napoleon in his decline. Beginning with 1813, he gave inhis adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations. He refused tosee him, as he passed through on his return from the island of Elba, andhe abstained from ordering public prayers for the Emperor in his dioceseduring the Hundred Days.</p><p>Besides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, one ageneral, the other a prefect. He wrote to both with tolerable frequency.He was harsh for a time towards the former, because, holding a command inProvence at the epoch of the disembarkation at Cannes, the general had puthimself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the Emperor asthough the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing toescape. His correspondence with the other brother, the ex-prefect, a fine,worthy man who lived in retirement at Paris, Rue Cassette, remained moreaffectionate.</p><p>Thus Monseigneur Bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit, his hour ofbitterness, his cloud. The shadow of the passions of the moment traversedthis grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things. Certainly, sucha man would have done well not to entertain any political opinions. Letthere be no mistake as to our meaning: we are not confounding what iscalled &ldquo;political opinions&rdquo; with the grand aspiration for progress, withthe sublime faith, patriotic, democratic, humane, which in our day shouldbe the very foundation of every generous intellect. Without going deeplyinto questions which are only indirectly connected with the subject ofthis book, we will simply say this: It would have been well if MonseigneurBienvenu had not been a Royalist, and if his glance had never been, for asingle instant, turned away from that serene contemplation in which isdistinctly discernible, above the fictions and the hatreds of this world,above the stormy vicissitudes of human things, the beaming of those threepure radiances, truth, justice, and charity.</p><p>While admitting that it was not for a political office that God createdMonseigneur Welcome, we should have understood and admired his protest inthe name of right and liberty, his proud opposition, his just but perilousresistance to the all-powerful Napoleon. But that which pleases us inpeople who are rising pleases us less in the case of people who arefalling. We only love the fray so long as there is danger, and in anycase, the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be theexterminators of the last. He who has not been a stubborn accuser inprosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin. The denunciator ofsuccess is the only legitimate executioner of the fall. As for us, whenProvidence intervenes and strikes, we let it work. 1812 commenced todisarm us. In 1813 the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturnlegislative body, emboldened by catastrophe, possessed only traits whicharoused indignation. And it was a crime to applaud, in 1814, in thepresence of those marshals who betrayed; in the presence of that senatewhich passed from one dunghill to another, insulting after having deified;in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing andspitting on its idol,&mdash;it was a duty to turn aside the head. In 1815,when the supreme disasters filled the air, when France was seized with ashiver at their sinister approach, when Waterloo could be dimly discernedopening before Napoleon, the mournful acclamation of the army and thepeople to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it, and, aftermaking all allowance for the despot, a heart like that of the Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;,ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touchingfeatures presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on thebrink of the abyss.</p><p>With this exception, he was in all things just, true, equitable,intelligent, humble and dignified, beneficent and kindly, which is onlyanother sort of benevolence. He was a priest, a sage, and a man. It mustbe admitted, that even in the political views with which we have justreproached him, and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity,he was tolerant and easy, more so, perhaps, than we who are speaking here.The porter of the town-hall had been placed there by the Emperor. He wasan old non-commissioned officer of the old guard, a member of the Legionof Honor at Austerlitz, as much of a Bonapartist as the eagle. This poorfellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks, which the law thenstigmatized as <i>seditious speeches</i>. After the imperial profiledisappeared from the Legion of Honor, he never dressed himself in hisregimentals, as he said, so that he should not be obliged to wear hiscross. He had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the crosswhich Napoleon had given him; this made a hole, and he would not putanything in its place. <i>&ldquo;I will die,&rdquo;</i> he said, <i>&ldquo;rather than wearthe three frogs upon my heart!&rdquo;</i> He liked to scoff aloud at LouisXVIII. &ldquo;The gouty old creature in English gaiters!&rdquo; he said; <i>&ldquo;let himtake himself off to Prussia with that queue of his.&rdquo;</i> He was happy tocombine in the same imprecation the two things which he most detested,Prussia and England. He did it so often that he lost his place. There hewas, turned out of the house, with his wife and children, and withoutbread. The Bishop sent for him, reproved him gently, and appointed himbeadle in the cathedral.</p><p>In the course of nine years Monseigneur Bienvenu had, by dint of holydeeds and gentle manners, filled the town of D&mdash;&mdash;with a sort oftender and filial reverence. Even his conduct towards Napoleon had beenaccepted and tacitly pardoned, as it were, by the people, the good andweakly flock who adored their emperor, but loved their bishop.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0012" id="link2HCH0012"></a>CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE SOLITUDE OF MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME</h3><p>A bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little abbés,just as a general is by a covey of young officers. This is what thatcharming Saint François de Sales calls somewhere &ldquo;les prêtresblancs-becs,&rdquo; callow priests. Every career has its aspirants, who form atrain for those who have attained eminence in it. There is no power whichhas not its dependents. There is no fortune which has not its court. Theseekers of the future eddy around the splendid present. Every metropolishas its staff of officials. Every bishop who possesses the least influencehas about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary, which goes theround, and maintains good order in the episcopal palace, and mounts guardover monseigneur&rsquo;s smile. To please a bishop is equivalent to gettingone&rsquo;s foot in the stirrup for a sub-diaconate. It is necessary to walkone&rsquo;s path discreetly; the apostleship does not disdain the canonship.</p><p>Just as there are bigwigs elsewhere, there are big mitres in the Church.These are the bishops who stand well at Court, who are rich, well endowed,skilful, accepted by the world, who know how to pray, no doubt, but whoknow also how to beg, who feel little scruple at making a whole diocesedance attendance in their person, who are connecting links between thesacristy and diplomacy, who are abbés rather than priests, prelates ratherthan bishops. Happy those who approach them! Being persons of influence,they create a shower about them, upon the assiduous and the favored, andupon all the young men who understand the art of pleasing, of largeparishes, prebends, archidiaconates, chaplaincies, and cathedral posts,while awaiting episcopal honors. As they advance themselves, they causetheir satellites to progress also; it is a whole solar system on themarch. Their radiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite. Theirprosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes, into nice little promotions.The larger the diocese of the patron, the fatter the curacy for thefavorite. And then, there is Rome. A bishop who understands how to becomean archbishop, an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal, carriesyou with him as conclavist; you enter a court of papal jurisdiction, youreceive the pallium, and behold! you are an auditor, then a papalchamberlain, then monsignor, and from a Grace to an Eminence is only astep, and between the Eminence and the Holiness there is but the smoke ofa ballot. Every skull-cap may dream of the tiara. The priest is nowadaysthe only man who can become a king in a regular manner; and what a king!the supreme king. Then what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary! Howmany blushing choristers, how many youthful abbés bear on their headsPerrette&rsquo;s pot of milk! Who knows how easy it is for ambition to callitself vocation? in good faith, perchance, and deceiving itself, devoteethat it is.</p><p>Monseigneur Bienvenu, poor, humble, retiring, was not accounted among thebig mitres. This was plain from the complete absence of young priestsabout him. We have seen that he &ldquo;did not take&rdquo; in Paris. Not a singlefuture dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man. Not a singlesprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in hisshadow. His canons and grand-vicars were good old men, rather vulgar likehimself, walled up like him in this diocese, without exit to acardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, with this difference, thatthey were finished and he was completed. The impossibility of growinggreat under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well understood, that no soonerhad the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they gotthemselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix or of Auch, and went offin a great hurry. For, in short, we repeat it, men wish to be pushed. Asaint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor; hemight communicate to you, by contagion, an incurable poverty, ananchylosis of the joints, which are useful in advancement, and in short,more renunciation than you desire; and this infectious virtue is avoided.Hence the isolation of Monseigneur Bienvenu. We live in the midst of agloomy society. Success; that is the lesson which falls drop by drop fromthe slope of corruption.</p><p>Be it said in passing, that success is a very hideous thing. Its falseresemblance to merit deceives men. For the masses, success has almost thesame profile as supremacy. Success, that Menæchmus of talent, has onedupe,&mdash;history. Juvenal and Tacitus alone grumble at it. In our day,a philosophy which is almost official has entered into its service, wearsthe livery of success, and performs the service of its antechamber.Succeed: theory. Prosperity argues capacity. Win in the lottery, andbehold! you are a clever man. He who triumphs is venerated. Be born with asilver spoon in your mouth! everything lies in that. Be lucky, and youwill have all the rest; be happy, and people will think you great. Outsideof five or six immense exceptions, which compose the splendor of acentury, contemporary admiration is nothing but short-sightedness. Gildingis gold. It does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance, so longas you do arrive. The common herd is an old Narcissus who adores himself,and who applauds the vulgar herd. That enormous ability by virtue of whichone is Moses, Æschylus, Dante, Michael Angelo, or Napoleon, the multitudeawards on the spot, and by acclamation, to whomsoever attains his object,in whatsoever it may consist. Let a notary transfigure himself into adeputy: let a false Corneille compose <i>Tiridate;</i> let a eunuch cometo possess a harem; let a military Prudhomme accidentally win the decisivebattle of an epoch; let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles for thearmy of the Sambre-and-Meuse, and construct for himself, out of thiscardboard, sold as leather, four hundred thousand francs of income; let apork-packer espouse usury, and cause it to bring forth seven or eightmillions, of which he is the father and of which it is the mother; let apreacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; let the steward of afine family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made ministerof finances,&mdash;and men call that Genius, just as they call the face ofMousqueton <i>Beauty</i>, and the mien of Claude <i>Majesty</i>. With theconstellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which aremade in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0013" id="link2HCH0013"></a>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;WHAT HE BELIEVED</h3><p>We are not obliged to sound the Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash; on the score oforthodoxy. In the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood butrespect. The conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word.Moreover, certain natures being given, we admit the possible developmentof all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own.</p><p>What did he think of this dogma, or of that mystery? These secrets of theinner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb, where soulsenter naked. The point on which we are certain is, that the difficultiesof faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case. No decay ispossible to the diamond. He believed to the extent of his powers. <i>&ldquo;Credoin Patrem,&rdquo;</i> he often exclaimed. Moreover, he drew from good works thatamount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience, and whichwhispers to a man, &ldquo;Thou art with God!&rdquo;</p><p>The point which we consider it our duty to note is, that outside of andbeyond his faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess of love. Itwas in that quarter, <i>quia multum amavit</i>,&mdash;because he lovedmuch&mdash;that he was regarded as vulnerable by &ldquo;serious men,&rdquo; &ldquo;gravepersons&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable people&rdquo;; favorite locutions of our sad worldwhere egotism takes its word of command from pedantry. What was thisexcess of love? It was a serene benevolence which overflowed men, as wehave already pointed out, and which, on occasion, extended even to things.He lived without disdain. He was indulgent towards God&rsquo;s creation. Everyman, even the best, has within him a thoughtless harshness which hereserves for animals. The Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash; had none of thatharshness, which is peculiar to many priests, nevertheless. He did not goas far as the Brahmin, but he seemed to have weighed this saying ofEcclesiastes: &ldquo;Who knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth?&rdquo; Hideousness of aspect, deformity of instinct, troubled him not, and didnot arouse his indignation. He was touched, almost softened by them. Itseemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds oflife which is apparent, the cause, the explanation, or the excuse forthem. He seemed at times to be asking God to commute these penalties. Heexamined without wrath, and with the eye of a linguist who is decipheringa palimpsest, that portion of chaos which still exists in nature. Thisreverie sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings. One morning he was inhis garden, and thought himself alone, but his sister was walking behindhim, unseen by him: suddenly he paused and gazed at something on theground; it was a large, black, hairy, frightful spider. His sister heardhim say:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Poor beast! It is not its fault!&rdquo;</p><p>Why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness?Puerile they may be; but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to SaintFrancis d&rsquo;Assisi and of Marcus Aurelius. One day he sprained his ankle inhis effort to avoid stepping on an ant. Thus lived this just man.Sometimes he fell asleep in his garden, and then there was nothing morevenerable possible.</p><p>Monseigneur Bienvenu had formerly been, if the stories anent his youth,and even in regard to his manhood, were to be believed, a passionate, and,possibly, a violent man. His universal suavity was less an instinct ofnature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into hisheart through the medium of life, and had trickled there slowly, thoughtby thought; for, in a character, as in a rock, there may exist aperturesmade by drops of water. These hollows are uneffaceable; these formationsare indestructible.</p><p>In 1815, as we think we have already said, he reached his seventy-fifthbirthday, but he did not appear to be more than sixty. He was not tall; hewas rather plump; and, in order to combat this tendency, he was fond oftaking long strolls on foot; his step was firm, and his form was butslightly bent, a detail from which we do not pretend to draw anyconclusion. Gregory XVI., at the age of eighty, held himself erect andsmiling, which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop. MonseigneurWelcome had what the people term a &ldquo;fine head,&rdquo; but so amiable was he thatthey forgot that it was fine.</p><p>When he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms,and of which we have already spoken, people felt at their ease with him,and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person. His fresh and ruddycomplexion, his very white teeth, all of which he had preserved, and whichwere displayed by his smile, gave him that open and easy air which causethe remark to be made of a man, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good fellow&rdquo;; and of an old man,&ldquo;He is a fine man.&rdquo; That, it will be recalled, was the effect which heproduced upon Napoleon. On the first encounter, and to one who saw him forthe first time, he was nothing, in fact, but a fine man. But if oneremained near him for a few hours, and beheld him in the least degreepensive, the fine man became gradually transfigured, and took on someimposing quality, I know not what; his broad and serious brow, renderedaugust by his white locks, became august also by virtue of meditation;majesty radiated from his goodness, though his goodness ceased not to beradiant; one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel onbeholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings, without ceasing tosmile. Respect, an unutterable respect, penetrated you by degrees andmounted to your heart, and one felt that one had before him one of thosestrong, thoroughly tried, and indulgent souls where thought is so grandthat it can no longer be anything but gentle.</p><p>As we have seen, prayer, the celebration of the offices of religion,alms-giving, the consolation of the afflicted, the cultivation of a bit ofland, fraternity, frugality, hospitality, renunciation, confidence, study,work, filled every day of his life. <i>Filled</i> is exactly the word;certainly the Bishop&rsquo;s day was quite full to the brim, of good words andgood deeds. Nevertheless, it was not complete if cold or rainy weatherprevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed,and after the two women had retired. It seemed to be a sort of rite withhim, to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of thegrand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens. Sometimes, if the two old womenwere not asleep, they heard him pacing slowly along the walks at a veryadvanced hour of the night. He was there alone, communing with himself,peaceful, adoring, comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenityof the ether, moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of theconstellations and the invisible splendor of God, opening his heart to thethoughts which fall from the Unknown. At such moments, while he offeredhis heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume,illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night, as he poured himself out inecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation, he could nothave told himself, probably, what was passing in his spirit; he feltsomething take its flight from him, and something descend into him.Mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of theuniverse!</p><p>He thought of the grandeur and presence of God; of the future eternity,that strange mystery; of the eternity past, a mystery still more strange;of all the infinities, which pierced their way into all his senses,beneath his eyes; and, without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible,he gazed upon it. He did not study God; he was dazzled by him. Heconsidered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms, which communicateaspects to matter, reveal forces by verifying them, create individualitiesin unity, proportions in extent, the innumerable in the infinite, and,through light, produce beauty. These conjunctions are formed and dissolvedincessantly; hence life and death.</p><p>He seated himself on a wooden bench, with his back against a decrepitvine; he gazed at the stars, past the puny and stunted silhouettes of hisfruit-trees. This quarter of an acre, so poorly planted, so encumberedwith mean buildings and sheds, was dear to him, and satisfied his wants.</p><p>What more was needed by this old man, who divided the leisure of his life,where there was so little leisure, between gardening in the daytime andcontemplation at night? Was not this narrow enclosure, with the heavensfor a ceiling, sufficient to enable him to adore God in his most divineworks, in turn? Does not this comprehend all, in fact? and what is thereleft to desire beyond it? A little garden in which to walk, and immensityin which to dream. At one&rsquo;s feet that which can be cultivated and plucked;over head that which one can study and meditate upon: some flowers onearth, and all the stars in the sky.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0014" id="link2HCH0014"></a>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;WHAT HE THOUGHT</h3><p>One last word.</p><p>Since this sort of details might, particularly at the present moment, andto use an expression now in fashion, give to the Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;a certain &ldquo;pantheistical&rdquo; physiognomy, and induce the belief, either tohis credit or discredit, that he entertained one of those personalphilosophies which are peculiar to our century, which sometimes spring upin solitary spirits, and there take on a form and grow until they usurpthe place of religion, we insist upon it, that not one of those personswho knew Monseigneur Welcome would have thought himself authorized tothink anything of the sort. That which enlightened this man was his heart.His wisdom was made of the light which comes from there.</p><p>No systems; many works. Abstruse speculations contain vertigo; no, thereis nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses. The apostlemay be daring, but the bishop must be timid. He would probably have felt ascruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems which are, in amanner, reserved for terrible great minds. There is a sacred horrorbeneath the porches of the enigma; those gloomy openings stand yawningthere, but something tells you, you, a passer-by in life, that you mustnot enter. Woe to him who penetrates thither!</p><p>Geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation,situated, so to speak, above all dogmas, propose their ideas to God. Theirprayer audaciously offers discussion. Their adoration interrogates. Thisis direct religion, which is full of anxiety and responsibility for himwho attempts its steep cliffs.</p><p>Human meditation has no limits. At his own risk and peril, it analyzes anddigs deep into its own bedazzlement. One might almost say, that by a sortof splendid reaction, it with it dazzles nature; the mysterious worldwhich surrounds us renders back what it has received; it is probable thatthe contemplators are contemplated. However that may be, there are onearth men who&mdash;are they men?&mdash;perceive distinctly at the vergeof the horizons of reverie the heights of the absolute, and who have theterrible vision of the infinite mountain. Monseigneur Welcome was one ofthese men; Monseigneur Welcome was not a genius. He would have fearedthose sublimities whence some very great men even, like Swedenborg andPascal, have slipped into insanity. Certainly, these powerful reverieshave their moral utility, and by these arduous paths one approaches toideal perfection. As for him, he took the path which shortens,&mdash;theGospel&rsquo;s.</p><p>He did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of Elijah&rsquo;s mantle;he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of events; he didnot see to condense in flame the light of things; he had nothing of theprophet and nothing of the magician about him. This humble soul loved, andthat was all.</p><p>That he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration isprobable: but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much;and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts, Saint Theresa and SaintJerome would be heretics.</p><p>He inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates. The universeappeared to him like an immense malady; everywhere he felt fever,everywhere he heard the sound of suffering, and, without seeking to solvethe enigma, he strove to dress the wound. The terrible spectacle ofcreated things developed tenderness in him; he was occupied only infinding for himself, and in inspiring others with the best way tocompassionate and relieve. That which exists was for this good and rarepriest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation.</p><p>There are men who toil at extracting gold; he toiled at the extraction ofpity. Universal misery was his mine. The sadness which reigned everywherewas but an excuse for unfailing kindness. <i>Love each other;</i> hedeclared this to be complete, desired nothing further, and that was thewhole of his doctrine. One day, that man who believed himself to be a&ldquo;philosopher,&rdquo; the senator who has already been alluded to, said to theBishop: &ldquo;Just survey the spectacle of the world: all war against all; thestrongest has the most wit. Your <i>love each other</i> is nonsense.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;</i>replied Monseigneur Welcome, without contesting the point, <i>&ldquo;if it isnonsense, the soul should shut itself up in it, as the pearl in theoyster.&rdquo;</i> Thus he shut himself up, he lived there, he was absolutelysatisfied with it, leaving on one side the prodigious questions whichattract and terrify, the fathomless perspectives of abstraction, theprecipices of metaphysics&mdash;all those profundities which converge, forthe apostle in God, for the atheist in nothingness; destiny, good andevil, the way of being against being, the conscience of man, thethoughtful somnambulism of the animal, the transformation in death, therecapitulation of existences which the tomb contains, the incomprehensiblegrafting of successive loves on the persistent <i>I</i>, the essence, thesubstance, the Nile, and the Ens, the soul, nature, liberty, necessity;perpendicular problems, sinister obscurities, where lean the giganticarchangels of the human mind; formidable abysses, which Lucretius, Manou,Saint Paul, Dante, contemplate with eyes flashing lightning, which seemsby its steady gaze on the infinite to cause stars to blaze forth there.</p><p>Monseigneur Bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior ofmysterious questions without scrutinizing them, and without troubling hisown mind with them, and who cherished in his own soul a grave respect fordarkness.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0020" id="link2H_4_0020"></a>BOOK SECOND&mdash;THE FALL</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0015" id="link2HCH0015"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE EVENING OF A DAY OF WALKING</h3><p>Early in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, a manwho was travelling on foot entered the little town of D&mdash;&mdash; Thefew inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at themoment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness. It wasdifficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance. He was aman of medium stature, thickset and robust, in the prime of life. He mighthave been forty-six or forty-eight years old. A cap with a droopingleather visor partly concealed his face, burned and tanned by sun andwind, and dripping with perspiration. His shirt of coarse yellow linen,fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted a view of hishairy breast: he had a cravat twisted into a string; trousers of bluedrilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee and torn on the other; anold gray, tattered blouse, patched on one of the elbows with a bit ofgreen cloth sewed on with twine; a tightly packed soldier knapsack, wellbuckled and perfectly new, on his back; an enormous, knotty stick in hishand; iron-shod shoes on his stockingless feet; a shaved head and a longbeard.</p><p>The sweat, the heat, the journey on foot, the dust, added I know not whatsordid quality to this dilapidated whole. His hair was closely cut, yetbristling, for it had begun to grow a little, and did not seem to havebeen cut for some time.</p><p>No one knew him. He was evidently only a chance passer-by. Whence came he?From the south; from the seashore, perhaps, for he made his entrance intoD&mdash;&mdash; by the same street which, seven months previously, hadwitnessed the passage of the Emperor Napoleon on his way from Cannes toParis. This man must have been walking all day. He seemed very muchfatigued. Some women of the ancient market town which is situated belowthe city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard Gassendi,and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade. Hemust have been very thirsty: for the children who followed him saw himstop again for a drink, two hundred paces further on, at the fountain inthe market-place.</p><p>On arriving at the corner of the Rue Poichevert, he turned to the left,and directed his steps toward the town-hall. He entered, then came out aquarter of an hour later. A gendarme was seated near the door, on thestone bench which General Drouot had mounted on the 4th of March to readto the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D&mdash;&mdash; theproclamation of the Gulf Juan. The man pulled off his cap and humblysaluted the gendarme.</p><p>The gendarme, without replying to his salute, stared attentively at him,followed him for a while with his eyes, and then entered the town-hall.</p><p>There then existed at D&mdash;&mdash; a fine inn at the sign of the <i>Crossof Colbas</i>. This inn had for a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre, aman of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to anotherLabarre, who kept the inn of the <i>Three Dauphins</i> in Grenoble, andhad served in the Guides. At the time of the Emperor&rsquo;s landing, manyrumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn ofthe <i>Three Dauphins</i>. It was said that General Bertrand, disguised asa carter, had made frequent trips thither in the month of January, andthat he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls ofgold to the citizens. The truth is, that when the Emperor entered Grenoblehe had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture; he hadthanked the mayor, saying, <i>&ldquo;I am going to the house of a brave man ofmy acquaintance&rdquo;;</i> and he had betaken himself to the <i>Three Dauphins</i>.This glory of the Labarre of the <i>Three Dauphins</i> was reflected uponthe Labarre of the <i>Cross of Colbas</i>, at a distance of five andtwenty leagues. It was said of him in the town, <i>&ldquo;That is the cousin ofthe man of Grenoble.&rdquo;</i></p><p>The man bent his steps towards this inn, which was the best in thecountry-side. He entered the kitchen, which opened on a level with thestreet. All the stoves were lighted; a huge fire blazed gayly in thefireplace. The host, who was also the chief cook, was going from onestew-pan to another, very busily superintending an excellent dinnerdesigned for the wagoners, whose loud talking, conversation, and laughterwere audible from an adjoining apartment. Any one who has travelled knowsthat there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoners. A fatmarmot, flanked by white partridges and heather-cocks, was turning on along spit before the fire; on the stove, two huge carps from Lake Lauzetand a trout from Lake Alloz were cooking.</p><p>The host, hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter, said, withoutraising his eyes from his stoves:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you wish, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Food and lodging,&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing easier,&rdquo; replied the host. At that moment he turned his head,took in the traveller&rsquo;s appearance with a single glance, and added, &ldquo;Bypaying for it.&rdquo;</p><p>The man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse, andanswered, &ldquo;I have money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case, we are at your service,&rdquo; said the host.</p><p>The man put his purse back in his pocket, removed his knapsack from hisback, put it on the ground near the door, retained his stick in his hand,and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire. D&mdash;&mdash; is inthe mountains. The evenings are cold there in October.</p><p>But as the host went back and forth, he scrutinized the traveller.</p><p>&ldquo;Will dinner be ready soon?&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>&ldquo;Immediately,&rdquo; replied the landlord.</p><p>While the newcomer was warming himself before the fire, with his backturned, the worthy host, Jacquin Labarre, drew a pencil from his pocket,then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a smalltable near the window. On the white margin he wrote a line or two, foldedit without sealing, and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child whoseemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey. Thelandlord whispered a word in the scullion&rsquo;s ear, and the child set off ona run in the direction of the town-hall.</p><p>The traveller saw nothing of all this.</p><p>Once more he inquired, &ldquo;Will dinner be ready soon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Immediately,&rdquo; responded the host.</p><p>The child returned. He brought back the paper. The host unfolded iteagerly, like a person who is expecting a reply. He seemed to read itattentively, then tossed his head, and remained thoughtful for a moment.Then he took a step in the direction of the traveller, who appeared to beimmersed in reflections which were not very serene.</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot receive you, sir,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>The man half rose.</p><p>&ldquo;What! Are you afraid that I will not pay you? Do you want me to pay youin advance? I have money, I tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is not that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have money&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said the host, &ldquo;have no room.&rdquo;</p><p>The man resumed tranquilly, &ldquo;Put me in the stable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The horses take up all the space.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; retorted the man; &ldquo;a corner of the loft then, a truss ofstraw. We will see about that after dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot give you any dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>This declaration, made in a measured but firm tone, struck the stranger asgrave. He rose.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! bah! But I am dying of hunger. I have been walking since sunrise. Ihave travelled twelve leagues. I pay. I wish to eat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have nothing,&rdquo; said the landlord.</p><p>The man burst out laughing, and turned towards the fireplace and thestoves: &ldquo;Nothing! and all that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All that is engaged.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By messieurs the wagoners.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How many are there of them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Twelve.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is enough food there for twenty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance.&rdquo;</p><p>The man seated himself again, and said, without raising his voice, &ldquo;I amat an inn; I am hungry, and I shall remain.&rdquo;</p><p>Then the host bent down to his ear, and said in a tone which made himstart, &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brandsinto the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff; he turned quicklyround, and as he opened his mouth to reply, the host gazed steadily at himand added, still in a low voice: &ldquo;Stop! there&rsquo;s enough of that sort oftalk. Do you want me to tell you your name? Your name is Jean Valjean. Nowdo you want me to tell you who you are? When I saw you come in I suspectedsomething; I sent to the town-hall, and this was the reply that was sentto me. Can you read?&rdquo;</p><p>So saying, he held out to the stranger, fully unfolded, the paper whichhad just travelled from the inn to the town-hall, and from the town-hallto the inn. The man cast a glance upon it. The landlord resumed after apause.</p><p>&ldquo;I am in the habit of being polite to every one. Go away!&rdquo;</p><p>The man dropped his head, picked up the knapsack which he had deposited onthe ground, and took his departure.</p><p>He chose the principal street. He walked straight on at a venture, keepingclose to the houses like a sad and humiliated man. He did not turn round asingle time. Had he done so, he would have seen the host of the <i>Crossof Colbas</i> standing on his threshold, surrounded by all the guests ofhis inn, and all the passers-by in the street, talking vivaciously, andpointing him out with his finger; and, from the glances of terror anddistrust cast by the group, he might have divined that his arrival wouldspeedily become an event for the whole town.</p><p>He saw nothing of all this. People who are crushed do not look behindthem. They know but too well the evil fate which follows them.</p><p>Thus he proceeded for some time, walking on without ceasing, traversing atrandom streets of which he knew nothing, forgetful of his fatigue, as isoften the case when a man is sad. All at once he felt the pangs of hungersharply. Night was drawing near. He glanced about him, to see whether hecould not discover some shelter.</p><p>The fine hostelry was closed to him; he was seeking some very humblepublic house, some hovel, however lowly.</p><p>Just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets; a pine branchsuspended from a cross-beam of iron was outlined against the white sky ofthe twilight. He proceeded thither.</p><p>It proved to be, in fact, a public house. The public house which is in theRue de Chaffaut.</p><p>The wayfarer halted for a moment, and peeped through the window into theinterior of the low-studded room of the public house, illuminated by asmall lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth. Some men wereengaged in drinking there. The landlord was warming himself. An iron pot,suspended from a crane, bubbled over the flame.</p><p>The entrance to this public house, which is also a sort of an inn, is bytwo doors. One opens on the street, the other upon a small yard filledwith manure. The traveller dare not enter by the street door. He slippedinto the yard, halted again, then raised the latch timidly and opened thedoor.</p><p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; said the master.</p><p>&ldquo;Some one who wants supper and bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good. We furnish supper and bed here.&rdquo;</p><p>He entered. All the men who were drinking turned round. The lampilluminated him on one side, the firelight on the other. They examined himfor some time while he was taking off his knapsack.</p><p>The host said to him, &ldquo;There is the fire. The supper is cooking in thepot. Come and warm yourself, comrade.&rdquo;</p><p>He approached and seated himself near the hearth. He stretched out hisfeet, which were exhausted with fatigue, to the fire; a fine odor wasemitted by the pot. All that could be distinguished of his face, beneathhis cap, which was well pulled down, assumed a vague appearance ofcomfort, mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual sufferingbestows.</p><p>It was, moreover, a firm, energetic, and melancholy profile. Thisphysiognomy was strangely composed; it began by seeming humble, and endedby seeming severe. The eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire beneathbrushwood.</p><p>One of the men seated at the table, however, was a fishmonger who, beforeentering the public house of the Rue de Chaffaut, had been to stable hishorse at Labarre&rsquo;s. It chanced that he had that very morning encounteredthis unprepossessing stranger on the road between Bras d&rsquo;Asse and&mdash;Ihave forgotten the name. I think it was Escoublon. Now, when he met him,the man, who then seemed already extremely weary, had requested him totake him on his crupper; to which the fishmonger had made no reply exceptby redoubling his gait. This fishmonger had been a member half an hourpreviously of the group which surrounded Jacquin Labarre, and had himselfrelated his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the <i>Crossof Colbas</i>. From where he sat he made an imperceptible sign to thetavern-keeper. The tavern-keeper went to him. They exchanged a few wordsin a low tone. The man had again become absorbed in his reflections.</p><p>The tavern-keeper returned to the fireplace, laid his hand abruptly on theshoulder of the man, and said to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You are going to get out of here.&rdquo;</p><p>The stranger turned round and replied gently, &ldquo;Ah! You know?&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was sent away from the other inn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you are to be turned out of this one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where would you have me go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Elsewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>The man took his stick and his knapsack and departed.</p><p>As he went out, some children who had followed him from the <i>Cross ofColbas</i>, and who seemed to be lying in wait for him, threw stones athim. He retraced his steps in anger, and threatened them with his stick:the children dispersed like a flock of birds.</p><p>He passed before the prison. At the door hung an iron chain attached to abell. He rang.</p><p>The wicket opened.</p><p>&ldquo;Turnkey,&rdquo; said he, removing his cap politely, &ldquo;will you have the kindnessto admit me, and give me a lodging for the night?&rdquo;</p><p>A voice replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The prison is not an inn. Get yourself arrested, and you will beadmitted.&rdquo;</p><p>The wicket closed again.</p><p>He entered a little street in which there were many gardens. Some of themare enclosed only by hedges, which lends a cheerful aspect to the street.In the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a small houseof a single story, the window of which was lighted up. He peered throughthe pane as he had done at the public house. Within was a largewhitewashed room, with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff, and a cradlein one corner, a few wooden chairs, and a double-barrelled gun hanging onthe wall. A table was spread in the centre of the room. A copper lampilluminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the pewter jug shininglike silver, and filled with wine, and the brown, smoking soup-tureen. Atthis table sat a man of about forty, with a merry and open countenance,who was dandling a little child on his knees. Close by a very young womanwas nursing another child. The father was laughing, the child waslaughing, the mother was smiling.</p><p>The stranger paused a moment in reverie before this tender and calmingspectacle. What was taking place within him? He alone could have told. Itis probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable,and that, in a place where he beheld so much happiness, he would findperhaps a little pity.</p><p>He tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock.</p><p>They did not hear him.</p><p>He tapped again.</p><p>He heard the woman say, &ldquo;It seems to me, husband, that some one isknocking.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the husband.</p><p>He tapped a third time.</p><p>The husband rose, took the lamp, and went to the door, which he opened.</p><p>He was a man of lofty stature, half peasant, half artisan. He wore a hugeleather apron, which reached to his left shoulder, and which a hammer, ared handkerchief, a powder-horn, and all sorts of objects which wereupheld by the girdle, as in a pocket, caused to bulge out. He carried hishead thrown backwards; his shirt, widely opened and turned back, displayedhis bull neck, white and bare. He had thick eyelashes, enormous blackwhiskers, prominent eyes, the lower part of his face like a snout; andbesides all this, that air of being on his own ground, which isindescribable.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon me, sir,&rdquo; said the wayfarer, &ldquo;Could you, in consideration ofpayment, give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in thegarden, in which to sleep? Tell me; can you? For money?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded the master of the house.</p><p>The man replied: &ldquo;I have just come from Puy-Moisson. I have walked all daylong. I have travelled twelve leagues. Can you?&mdash;if I pay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would not refuse,&rdquo; said the peasant, &ldquo;to lodge any respectable man whowould pay me. But why do you not go to the inn?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bah! Impossible. This is neither a fair nor a market day. Have you beento Labarre?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>The traveller replied with embarrassment: &ldquo;I do not know. He did notreceive me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you been to What&rsquo;s-his-name&rsquo;s, in the Rue Chaffaut?&rdquo;</p><p>The stranger&rsquo;s embarrassment increased; he stammered, &ldquo;He did not receiveme either.&rdquo;</p><p>The peasant&rsquo;s countenance assumed an expression of distrust; he surveyedthe newcomer from head to feet, and suddenly exclaimed, with a sort ofshudder:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you the man?&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>He cast a fresh glance upon the stranger, took three steps backwards,placed the lamp on the table, and took his gun down from the wall.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the words, <i>Are you the man?</i> the woman had risen, hadclasped her two children in her arms, and had taken refuge precipitatelybehind her husband, staring in terror at the stranger, with her bosomuncovered, and with frightened eyes, as she murmured in a low tone, <i>&ldquo;Tso-maraude.&rdquo;</i><ahref="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1" id="linknoteref-1">1</a></p><p>All this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to one&rsquo;sself. After having scrutinized the man for several moments, as onescrutinizes a viper, the master of the house returned to the door andsaid:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Clear out!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake, a glass of water,&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>&ldquo;A shot from my gun!&rdquo; said the peasant.</p><p>Then he closed the door violently, and the man heard him shoot two largebolts. A moment later, the window-shutter was closed, and the sound of abar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside.</p><p>Night continued to fall. A cold wind from the Alps was blowing. By thelight of the expiring day the stranger perceived, in one of the gardenswhich bordered the street, a sort of hut, which seemed to him to be builtof sods. He climbed over the wooden fence resolutely, and found himself inthe garden. He approached the hut; its door consisted of a very low andnarrow aperture, and it resembled those buildings which road-laborersconstruct for themselves along the roads. He thought without doubt, thatit was, in fact, the dwelling of a road-laborer; he was suffering fromcold and hunger, but this was, at least, a shelter from the cold. Thissort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night. He threw himself flaton his face, and crawled into the hut. It was warm there, and he found atolerably good bed of straw. He lay, for a moment, stretched out on thisbed, without the power to make a movement, so fatigued was he. Then, asthe knapsack on his back was in his way, and as it furnished, moreover, apillow ready to his hand, he set about unbuckling one of the straps. Atthat moment, a ferocious growl became audible. He raised his eyes. Thehead of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance ofthe hut.</p><p>It was a dog&rsquo;s kennel.</p><p>He was himself vigorous and formidable; he armed himself with his staff,made a shield of his knapsack, and made his way out of the kennel in thebest way he could, not without enlarging the rents in his rags.</p><p>He left the garden in the same manner, but backwards, being obliged, inorder to keep the dog respectful, to have recourse to that manœuvrewith his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as <i>larose couverte</i>.</p><p>When he had, not without difficulty, repassed the fence, and found himselfonce more in the street, alone, without refuge, without shelter, without aroof over his head, chased even from that bed of straw and from thatmiserable kennel, he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone, and itappears that a passer-by heard him exclaim, &ldquo;I am not even a dog!&rdquo;</p><p>He soon rose again and resumed his march. He went out of the town, hopingto find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford himshelter.</p><p>He walked thus for some time, with his head still drooping. When he felthimself far from every human habitation, he raised his eyes and gazedsearchingly about him. He was in a field. Before him was one of those lowhills covered with close-cut stubble, which, after the harvest, resembleshaved heads.</p><p>The horizon was perfectly black. This was not alone the obscurity ofnight; it was caused by very low-hanging clouds which seemed to rest uponthe hill itself, and which were mounting and filling the whole sky.Meanwhile, as the moon was about to rise, and as there was still floatingin the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight, these clouds formedat the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch, whence a gleam of lightfell upon the earth.</p><p>The earth was thus better lighted than the sky, which produces aparticularly sinister effect, and the hill, whose contour was poor andmean, was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon. The wholeeffect was hideous, petty, lugubrious, and narrow.</p><p>There was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree,which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer.</p><p>This man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits ofintelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysteriousaspects of things; nevertheless, there was something in that sky, in thathill, in that plain, in that tree, which was so profoundly desolate, thatafter a moment of immobility and reverie he turned back abruptly. There areinstants when nature seems hostile.</p><p>He retraced his steps; the gates of D&mdash;&mdash; were closed. D&mdash;&mdash;,which had sustained sieges during the wars of religion, was stillsurrounded in 1815 by ancient walls flanked by square towers which havebeen demolished since. He passed through a breach and entered the townagain.</p><p>It might have been eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening. As he was not acquaintedwith the streets, he recommenced his walk at random.</p><p>In this way he came to the prefecture, then to the seminary. As he passedthrough the Cathedral Square, he shook his fist at the church.</p><p>At the corner of this square there is a printing establishment. It isthere that the proclamations of the Emperor and of the Imperial Guard tothe army, brought from the Island of Elba and dictated by Napoleonhimself, were printed for the first time.</p><p>Worn out with fatigue, and no longer entertaining any hope, he lay down ona stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office.</p><p>At that moment an old woman came out of the church. She saw the manstretched out in the shadow. &ldquo;What are you doing there, my friend?&rdquo; saidshe.</p><p>He answered harshly and angrily: &ldquo;As you see, my good woman, I amsleeping.&rdquo; The good woman, who was well worthy the name, in fact, was theMarquise de R&mdash;&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;On this bench?&rdquo; she went on.</p><p>&ldquo;I have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;to-dayI have a mattress of stone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have been a soldier?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my good woman, a soldier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you not go to the inn?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I have no money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Madame de R&mdash;&mdash;, &ldquo;I have only four sous in mypurse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give it to me all the same.&rdquo;</p><p>The man took the four sous. Madame de R&mdash;&mdash; continued: &ldquo;Youcannot obtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum. But have you tried?It is impossible for you to pass the night thus. You are cold and hungry,no doubt. Some one might have given you a lodging out of charity.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have knocked at all doors.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have been driven away everywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>The &ldquo;good woman&rdquo; touched the man&rsquo;s arm, and pointed out to him on theother side of the street a small, low house, which stood beside theBishop&rsquo;s palace.</p><p>&ldquo;You have knocked at all doors?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you knocked at that one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Knock there.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0016" id="link2HCH0016"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;PRUDENCE COUNSELLED TO WISDOM.</h3><p>That evening, the Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;, after his promenade throughthe town, remained shut up rather late in his room. He was busy over agreat work on <i>Duties</i>, which was never completed, unfortunately. Hewas carefully compiling everything that the Fathers and the doctors havesaid on this important subject. His book was divided into two parts:firstly, the duties of all; secondly, the duties of each individual,according to the class to which he belongs. The duties of all are thegreat duties. There are four of these. Saint Matthew points them out:duties towards God (<i>Matt.</i> vi.); duties towards one&rsquo;s self (<i>Matt.</i>v. 29, 30); duties towards one&rsquo;s neighbor (<i>Matt.</i> vii. 12); dutiestowards animals (<i>Matt.</i> vi. 20, 25). As for the other duties theBishop found them pointed out and prescribed elsewhere: to sovereigns andsubjects, in the Epistle to the Romans; to magistrates, to wives, tomothers, to young men, by Saint Peter; to husbands, fathers, children andservants, in the Epistle to the Ephesians; to the faithful, in the Epistleto the Hebrews; to virgins, in the Epistle to the Corinthians. Out ofthese precepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole, whichhe desired to present to souls.</p><p>At eight o&rsquo;clock he was still at work, writing with a good deal ofinconvenience upon little squares of paper, with a big book open on hisknees, when Madame Magloire entered, according to her wont, to get thesilver-ware from the cupboard near his bed. A moment later, the Bishop,knowing that the table was set, and that his sister was probably waitingfor him, shut his book, rose from his table, and entered the dining-room.</p><p>The dining-room was an oblong apartment, with a fireplace, which had adoor opening on the street (as we have said), and a window opening on thegarden.</p><p>Madame Magloire was, in fact, just putting the last touches to the table.</p><p>As she performed this service, she was conversing with MademoiselleBaptistine.</p><p>A lamp stood on the table; the table was near the fireplace. A wood firewas burning there.</p><p>One can easily picture to one&rsquo;s self these two women, both of whom wereover sixty years of age. Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious;Mademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller than herbrother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of 1806,which she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had lasted eversince. To borrow vulgar phrases, which possess the merit of givingutterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardlysuffice to express, Madame Magloire had the air of a <i>peasant</i>, andMademoiselle Baptistine that of a <i>lady</i>. Madame Magloire wore awhite quilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon herneck, the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a verywhite fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff, withlarge, short sleeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks,knotted round the waist with a green ribbon, with a stomacher of the sameattached by two pins at the upper corners, coarse shoes on her feet, andyellow stockings, like the women of Marseilles. Mademoiselle Baptistine&rsquo;sgown was cut on the patterns of 1806, with a short waist, a narrow,sheath-like skirt, puffed sleeves, with flaps and buttons. She concealedher gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the <i>baby</i> wig. MadameMagloire had an intelligent, vivacious, and kindly air; the two corners ofher mouth unequally raised, and her upper lip, which was larger than thelower, imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious look. So long asMonseigneur held his peace, she talked to him resolutely with a mixture ofrespect and freedom; but as soon as Monseigneur began to speak, as we haveseen, she obeyed passively like her mistress. Mademoiselle Baptistine didnot even speak. She confined herself to obeying and pleasing him. She hadnever been pretty, even when she was young; she had large, blue, prominenteyes, and a long arched nose; but her whole visage, her whole person,breathed forth an ineffable goodness, as we stated in the beginning. Shehad always been predestined to gentleness; but faith, charity, hope, thosethree virtues which mildly warm the soul, had gradually elevated thatgentleness to sanctity. Nature had made her a lamb, religion had made heran angel. Poor sainted virgin! Sweet memory which has vanished!</p><p>Mademoiselle Baptistine has so often narrated what passed at the episcopalresidence that evening, that there are many people now living who stillrecall the most minute details.</p><p>At the moment when the Bishop entered, Madame Magloire was talking withconsiderable vivacity. She was haranguing Mademoiselle Baptistine on asubject which was familiar to her and to which the Bishop was alsoaccustomed. The question concerned the lock upon the entrance door.</p><p>It appears that while procuring some provisions for supper, MadameMagloire had heard things in divers places. People had spoken of a prowlerof evil appearance; a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must besomewhere about the town, and those who should take it into their heads toreturn home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant encounters.The police was very badly organized, moreover, because there was no lovelost between the Prefect and the Mayor, who sought to injure each other bymaking things happen. It behooved wise people to play the part of theirown police, and to guard themselves well, and care must be taken to dulyclose, bar and barricade their houses, and to <i>fasten the doors well</i>.</p><p>Madame Magloire emphasized these last words; but the Bishop had just comefrom his room, where it was rather cold. He seated himself in front of thefire, and warmed himself, and then fell to thinking of other things. Hedid not take up the remark dropped with design by Madame Magloire. Sherepeated it. Then Mademoiselle Baptistine, desirous of satisfying MadameMagloire without displeasing her brother, ventured to say timidly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you hear what Madame Magloire is saying, brother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have heard something of it in a vague way,&rdquo; replied the Bishop. Thenhalf-turning in his chair, placing his hands on his knees, and raisingtowards the old servant woman his cordial face, which so easily grewjoyous, and which was illuminated from below by the firelight,&mdash;&ldquo;Come,what is the matter? What is the matter? Are we in any great danger?&rdquo;</p><p>Then Madame Magloire began the whole story afresh, exaggerating it alittle without being aware of the fact. It appeared that a Bohemian, abare-footed vagabond, a sort of dangerous mendicant, was at that moment inthe town. He had presented himself at Jacquin Labarre&rsquo;s to obtainlodgings, but the latter had not been willing to take him in. He had beenseen to arrive by the way of the boulevard Gassendi and roam about thestreets in the gloaming. A gallows-bird with a terrible face.</p><p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said the Bishop.</p><p>This willingness to interrogate encouraged Madame Magloire; it seemed toher to indicate that the Bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed; shepursued triumphantly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Monseigneur. That is how it is. There will be some sort ofcatastrophe in this town to-night. Every one says so. And withal, thepolice is so badly regulated&rdquo; (a useful repetition). &ldquo;The idea of livingin a mountainous country, and not even having lights in the streets atnight! One goes out. Black as ovens, indeed! And I say, Monseigneur, andMademoiselle there says with me&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; interrupted his sister, &ldquo;say nothing. What my brother does is welldone.&rdquo;</p><p>Madame Magloire continued as though there had been no protest:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;We say that this house is not safe at all; that if Monseigneur willpermit, I will go and tell Paulin Musebois, the locksmith, to come andreplace the ancient locks on the doors; we have them, and it is only thework of a moment; for I say that nothing is more terrible than a doorwhich can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first passer-by;and I say that we need bolts, Monseigneur, if only for this night;moreover, Monseigneur has the habit of always saying &lsquo;come in&rsquo;; andbesides, even in the middle of the night, O mon Dieu! there is no need toask permission.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the Bishop.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0017" id="link2HCH0017"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE HEROISM OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE.</h3><p>The door opened.</p><p>It opened wide with a rapid movement, as though some one had given it anenergetic and resolute push.</p><p>A man entered.</p><p>We already know the man. It was the wayfarer whom we have seen wanderingabout in search of shelter.</p><p>He entered, advanced a step, and halted, leaving the door open behind him.He had his knapsack on his shoulders, his cudgel in his hand, a rough,audacious, weary, and violent expression in his eyes. The fire on thehearth lighted him up. He was hideous. It was a sinister apparition.</p><p>Madame Magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry. She trembled,and stood with her mouth wide open.</p><p>Mademoiselle Baptistine turned round, beheld the man entering, and halfstarted up in terror; then, turning her head by degrees towards thefireplace again, she began to observe her brother, and her face becameonce more profoundly calm and serene.</p><p>The Bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man.</p><p>As he opened his mouth, doubtless to ask the newcomer what he desired,the man rested both hands on his staff, directed his gaze at the old manand the two women, and without waiting for the Bishop to speak, he said,in a loud voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;See here. My name is Jean Valjean. I am a convict from the galleys. Ihave passed nineteen years in the galleys. I was liberated four days ago,and am on my way to Pontarlier, which is my destination. I have beenwalking for four days since I left Toulon. I have travelled a dozenleagues to-day on foot. This evening, when I arrived in these parts, Iwent to an inn, and they turned me out, because of my yellow passport,which I had shown at the town-hall. I had to do it. I went to an inn. Theysaid to me, &lsquo;Be off,&rsquo; at both places. No one would take me. I went to theprison; the jailer would not admit me. I went into a dog&rsquo;s kennel; the dogbit me and chased me off, as though he had been a man. One would have saidthat he knew who I was. I went into the fields, intending to sleep in theopen air, beneath the stars. There were no stars. I thought it was goingto rain, and I re-entered the town, to seek the recess of a doorway.Yonder, in the square, I meant to sleep on a stone bench. A good womanpointed out your house to me, and said to me, &lsquo;Knock there!&rsquo; I haveknocked. What is this place? Do you keep an inn? I have money&mdash;savings.One hundred and nine francs fifteen sous, which I earned in the galleys bymy labor, in the course of nineteen years. I will pay. What is that to me?I have money. I am very weary; twelve leagues on foot; I am very hungry.Are you willing that I should remain?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Madame Magloire,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;you will set another place.&rdquo;</p><p>The man advanced three paces, and approached the lamp which was on thetable. &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; he resumed, as though he had not quite understood; &ldquo;that&rsquo;snot it. Did you hear? I am a galley-slave; a convict. I come from thegalleys.&rdquo; He drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow paper, which heunfolded. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my passport. Yellow, as you see. This serves to expel mefrom every place where I go. Will you read it? I know how to read. Ilearned in the galleys. There is a school there for those who choose tolearn. Hold, this is what they put on this passport: &lsquo;Jean Valjean,discharged convict, native of&rsquo;&mdash;that is nothing to you&mdash;&lsquo;hasbeen nineteen years in the galleys: five years for house-breaking andburglary; fourteen years for having attempted to escape on four occasions.He is a very dangerous man.&rsquo; There! Every one has cast me out. Are youwilling to receive me? Is this an inn? Will you give me something to eatand a bed? Have you a stable?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Madame Magloire,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;you will put white sheets on the bedin the alcove.&rdquo; We have already explained the character of the two women&rsquo;sobedience.</p><p>Madame Magloire retired to execute these orders.</p><p>The Bishop turned to the man.</p><p>&ldquo;Sit down, sir, and warm yourself. We are going to sup in a few moments,and your bed will be prepared while you are supping.&rdquo;</p><p>At this point the man suddenly comprehended. The expression of his face,up to that time sombre and harsh, bore the imprint of stupefaction, ofdoubt, of joy, and became extraordinary. He began stammering like a crazyman:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Really? What! You will keep me? You do not drive me forth? A convict! Youcall me <i>sir!</i> You do not address me as <i>thou?</i> &lsquo;Get out ofhere, you dog!&rsquo; is what people always say to me. I felt sure that youwould expel me, so I told you at once who I am. Oh, what a good woman thatwas who directed me hither! I am going to sup! A bed with a mattress andsheets, like the rest of the world! a bed! It is nineteen years since Ihave slept in a bed! You actually do not want me to go! You are goodpeople. Besides, I have money. I will pay well. Pardon me, monsieur theinn-keeper, but what is your name? I will pay anything you ask. You are afine man. You are an inn-keeper, are you not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied the Bishop, &ldquo;a priest who lives here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A priest!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Oh, what a fine priest! Then you are not goingto demand any money of me? You are the curé, are you not? the curé of thisbig church? Well! I am a fool, truly! I had not perceived your skull-cap.&rdquo;</p><p>As he spoke, he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner,replaced his passport in his pocket, and seated himself. MademoiselleBaptistine gazed mildly at him. He continued:</p><p>&ldquo;You are humane, Monsieur le Curé; you have not scorned me. A good priestis a very good thing. Then you do not require me to pay?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Bishop; &ldquo;keep your money. How much have you? Did you nottell me one hundred and nine francs?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And fifteen sous,&rdquo; added the man.</p><p>&ldquo;One hundred and nine francs fifteen sous. And how long did it take you toearn that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nineteen years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nineteen years!&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop sighed deeply.</p><p>The man continued: &ldquo;I have still the whole of my money. In four days Ihave spent only twenty-five sous, which I earned by helping unload somewagons at Grasse. Since you are an abbé, I will tell you that we had achaplain in the galleys. And one day I saw a bishop there. Monseigneur iswhat they call him. He was the Bishop of Majore at Marseilles. He is thecuré who rules over the other curés, you understand. Pardon me, I say thatvery badly; but it is such a far-off thing to me! You understand what weare! He said mass in the middle of the galleys, on an altar. He had apointed thing, made of gold, on his head; it glittered in the bright lightof midday. We were all ranged in lines on the three sides, with cannonswith lighted matches facing us. We could not see very well. He spoke; buthe was too far off, and we did not hear. That is what a bishop is like.&rdquo;</p><p>While he was speaking, the Bishop had gone and shut the door, which hadremained wide open.</p><p>Madame Magloire returned. She brought a silver fork and spoon, which sheplaced on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Madame Magloire,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;place those things as near the fireas possible.&rdquo; And turning to his guest: &ldquo;The night wind is harsh on theAlps. You must be cold, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>Each time that he uttered the word <i>sir</i>, in his voice which was sogently grave and polished, the man&rsquo;s face lighted up. <i>Monsieur</i> to aconvict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the <i>Medusa</i>.Ignominy thirsts for consideration.</p><p>&ldquo;This lamp gives a very bad light,&rdquo; said the Bishop.</p><p>Madame Magloire understood him, and went to get the two silvercandlesticks from the chimney-piece in Monseigneur&rsquo;s bed-chamber, andplaced them, lighted, on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Curé,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;you are good; you do not despise me.You receive me into your house. You light your candles for me. Yet I havenot concealed from you whence I come and that I am an unfortunate man.&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop, who was sitting close to him, gently touched his hand. &ldquo;Youcould not help telling me who you were. This is not my house; it is thehouse of Jesus Christ. This door does not demand of him who enters whetherhe has a name, but whether he has a grief. You suffer, you are hungry andthirsty; you are welcome. And do not thank me; do not say that I receiveyou in my house. No one is at home here, except the man who needs arefuge. I say to you, who are passing by, that you are much more at homehere than I am myself. Everything here is yours. What need have I to knowyour name? Besides, before you told me you had one which I knew.&rdquo;</p><p>The man opened his eyes in astonishment.</p><p>&ldquo;Really? You knew what I was called?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Bishop, &ldquo;you are called my brother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop, Monsieur le Curé,&rdquo; exclaimed the man. &ldquo;I was very hungry when Ientered here; but you are so good, that I no longer know what has happenedto me.&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop looked at him, and said,&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You have suffered much?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, the red coat, the ball on the ankle, a plank to sleep on, heat, cold,toil, the convicts, the thrashings, the double chain for nothing, the cellfor one word; even sick and in bed, still the chain! Dogs, dogs arehappier! Nineteen years! I am forty-six. Now there is the yellow passport.That is what it is like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resumed the Bishop, &ldquo;you have come from a very sad place. Listen.There will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face of a repentantsinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men. If you emerge fromthat sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind, youare deserving of pity; if you emerge with thoughts of good-will and ofpeace, you are more worthy than any one of us.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, Madame Magloire had served supper: soup, made with water,oil, bread, and salt; a little bacon, a bit of mutton, figs, a freshcheese, and a large loaf of rye bread. She had, of her own accord, addedto the Bishop&rsquo;s ordinary fare a bottle of his old Mauves wine.</p><p>The Bishop&rsquo;s face at once assumed that expression of gayety which ispeculiar to hospitable natures. &ldquo;To table!&rdquo; he cried vivaciously. As washis custom when a stranger supped with him, he made the man sit on hisright. Mademoiselle Baptistine, perfectly peaceable and natural, took herseat at his left.</p><p>The Bishop asked a blessing; then helped the soup himself, according tohis custom. The man began to eat with avidity.</p><p>All at once the Bishop said: &ldquo;It strikes me there is something missing onthis table.&rdquo;</p><p>Madame Magloire had, in fact, only placed the three sets of forks andspoons which were absolutely necessary. Now, it was the usage of thehouse, when the Bishop had any one to supper, to lay out the whole sixsets of silver on the table-cloth&mdash;an innocent ostentation. Thisgraceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child&rsquo;s play, which was full ofcharm in that gentle and severe household, which raised poverty intodignity.</p><p>Madame Magloire understood the remark, went out without saying a word, anda moment later the three sets of silver forks and spoons demanded by theBishop were glittering upon the cloth, symmetrically arranged before thethree persons seated at the table.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0018" id="link2HCH0018"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;DETAILS CONCERNING THE CHEESE-DAIRIES OF PONTARLIER.</h3><p>Now, in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table, we cannot dobetter than to transcribe here a passage from one of MademoiselleBaptistine&rsquo;s letters to Madame Boischevron, wherein the conversationbetween the convict and the Bishop is described with ingenious minuteness.</p><p>&ldquo;. . . This man paid no attention to any one. He ate with the voracity ofa starving man. However, after supper he said:</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Monsieur le Curé of the good God, all this is far too good for me; but Imust say that the carters who would not allow me to eat with them keep abetter table than you do.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Between ourselves, the remark rather shocked me. My brother replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They are more fatigued than I.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; returned the man, &lsquo;they have more money. You are poor; I see thatplainly. You cannot be even a curate. Are you really a curé? Ah, if thegood God were but just, you certainly ought to be a curé!&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The good God is more than just,&rsquo; said my brother.</p><p>&ldquo;A moment later he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Monsieur Jean Valjean, is it to Pontarlier that you are going?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With my road marked out for me.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think that is what the man said. Then he went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I must be on my way by daybreak to-morrow. Travelling is hard. If thenights are cold, the days are hot.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are going to a good country,&rsquo; said my brother. &lsquo;During theRevolution my family was ruined. I took refuge in Franche-Comté at first,and there I lived for some time by the toil of my hands. My will was good.I found plenty to occupy me. One has only to choose. There are papermills, tanneries, distilleries, oil factories, watch factories on a largescale, steel mills, copper works, twenty iron foundries at least, four ofwhich, situated at Lods, at Châtillon, at Audincourt, and at Beure, aretolerably large.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think I am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which mybrother mentioned. Then he interrupted himself and addressed me:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Have we not some relatives in those parts, my dear sister?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I replied,&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We did have some; among others, M. de Lucenet, who was captain of thegates at Pontarlier under the old régime.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; resumed my brother; &lsquo;but in &rsquo;93, one had no longer any relatives,one had only one&rsquo;s arms. I worked. They have, in the country ofPontarlier, whither you are going, Monsieur Valjean, a truly patriarchaland truly charming industry, my sister. It is their cheese-dairies, whichthey call <i>fruitières</i>.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then my brother, while urging the man to eat, explained to him, withgreat minuteness, what these <i>fruitières</i> of Pontarlier were; thatthey were divided into two classes: the <i>big barns</i> which belong tothe rich, and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from sevento eight thousand cheeses each summer, and the <i>associated fruitières</i>,which belong to the poor; these are the peasants of mid-mountain, who holdtheir cows in common, and share the proceeds. &lsquo;They engage the services ofa cheese-maker, whom they call the <i>grurin</i>; the <i>grurin</i>receives the milk of the associates three times a day, and marks thequantity on a double tally. It is towards the end of April that the workof the cheese-dairies begins; it is towards the middle of June that thecheese-makers drive their cows to the mountains.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The man recovered his animation as he ate. My brother made him drink thatgood Mauves wine, which he does not drink himself, because he says thatwine is expensive. My brother imparted all these details with that easygayety of his with which you are acquainted, interspersing his words withgraceful attentions to me. He recurred frequently to that comfortabletrade of <i>grurin</i>, as though he wished the man to understand, withoutadvising him directly and harshly, that this would afford him a refuge.One thing struck me. This man was what I have told you. Well, neitherduring supper, nor during the entire evening, did my brother utter asingle word, with the exception of a few words about Jesus when heentered, which could remind the man of what he was, nor of what my brotherwas. To all appearances, it was an occasion for preaching him a littlesermon, and of impressing the Bishop on the convict, so that a mark of thepassage might remain behind. This might have appeared to any one else whohad this, unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish hissoul as well as his body, and to bestow upon him some reproach, seasonedwith moralizing and advice, or a little commiseration, with an exhortationto conduct himself better in the future. My brother did not even ask himfrom what country he came, nor what was his history. For in his historythere is a fault, and my brother seemed to avoid everything which couldremind him of it. To such a point did he carry it, that at one time, whenmy brother was speaking of the mountaineers of Pontarlier, <i>who exercisea gentle labor near heaven, and who</i>, he added, <i>are happy becausethey are innocent</i>, he stopped short, fearing lest in this remark theremight have escaped him something which might wound the man. By dint ofreflection, I think I have comprehended what was passing in my brother&rsquo;sheart. He was thinking, no doubt, that this man, whose name is JeanValjean, had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind; that thebest thing was to divert him from it, and to make him believe, if onlymomentarily, that he was a person like any other, by treating him just inhis ordinary way. Is not this indeed, to understand charity well? Is therenot, dear Madame, something truly evangelical in this delicacy whichabstains from sermon, from moralizing, from allusions? and is not thetruest pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch it at all? It hasseemed to me that this might have been my brother&rsquo;s private thought. Inany case, what I can say is that, if he entertained all these ideas, hegave no sign of them; from beginning to end, even to me he was the same ashe is every evening, and he supped with this Jean Valjean with the sameair and in the same manner in which he would have supped with M. Gédéon lePrévost, or with the curate of the parish.</p><p>&ldquo;Towards the end, when he had reached the figs, there came a knock at thedoor. It was Mother Gerbaud, with her little one in her arms. My brotherkissed the child on the brow, and borrowed fifteen sous which I had aboutme to give to Mother Gerbaud. The man was not paying much heed to anythingthen. He was no longer talking, and he seemed very much fatigued. Afterpoor old Gerbaud had taken her departure, my brother said grace; then heturned to the man and said to him, &lsquo;You must be in great need of yourbed.&rsquo; Madame Magloire cleared the table very promptly. I understood thatwe must retire, in order to allow this traveller to go to sleep, and weboth went upstairs. Nevertheless, I sent Madame Magloire down a momentlater, to carry to the man&rsquo;s bed a goat skin from the Black Forest, whichwas in my room. The nights are frigid, and that keeps one warm. It is apity that this skin is old; all the hair is falling out. My brother boughtit while he was in Germany, at Tottlingen, near the sources of the Danube,as well as the little ivory-handled knife which I use at table.</p><p>&ldquo;Madame Magloire returned immediately. We said our prayers in thedrawing-room, where we hang up the linen, and then we each retired to ourown chambers, without saying a word to each other.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0019" id="link2HCH0019"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;TRANQUILLITY</h3><p>After bidding his sister good night, Monseigneur Bienvenu took one of thetwo silver candlesticks from the table, handed the other to his guest, andsaid to him,&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur, I will conduct you to your room.&rdquo;</p><p>The man followed him.</p><p>As might have been observed from what has been said above, the house wasso arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove wassituated, or to get out of it, it was necessary to traverse the Bishop&rsquo;sbedroom.</p><p>At the moment when he was crossing this apartment, Madame Magloire wasputting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed. Thiswas her last care every evening before she went to bed.</p><p>The Bishop installed his guest in the alcove. A fresh white bed had beenprepared there. The man set the candle down on a small table.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;may you pass a good night. To-morrow morning,before you set out, you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abbé,&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>Hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace, when all of a sudden,and without transition, he made a strange movement, which would havefrozen the two sainted women with horror, had they witnessed it. Even atthis day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at thatmoment. Did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace? Was hesimply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure even tohimself? He turned abruptly to the old man, folded his arms, and bendingupon his host a savage gaze, he exclaimed in a hoarse voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! really! You lodge me in your house, close to yourself like this?&rdquo;</p><p>He broke off, and added with a laugh in which there lurked somethingmonstrous:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you really reflected well? How do you know that I have not been anassassin?&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the concern of the good God.&rdquo;</p><p>Then gravely, and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking tohimself, he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed hisbenediction on the man, who did not bow, and without turning his head orlooking behind him, he returned to his bedroom.</p><p>When the alcove was in use, a large serge curtain drawn from wall to wallconcealed the altar. The Bishop knelt before this curtain as he passed andsaid a brief prayer. A moment later he was in his garden, walking,meditating, contemplating, his heart and soul wholly absorbed in thosegrand and mysterious things which God shows at night to the eyes whichremain open.</p><p>As for the man, he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit bythe nice white sheets. Snuffing out his candle with his nostrils after themanner of convicts, he dropped, all dressed as he was, upon the bed, wherehe immediately fell into a profound sleep.</p><p>Midnight struck as the Bishop returned from his garden to his apartment.</p><p>A few minutes later all were asleep in the little house.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0020" id="link2HCH0020"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;JEAN VALJEAN</h3><p>Towards the middle of the night Jean Valjean woke.</p><p>Jean Valjean came from a poor peasant family of Brie. He had not learnedto read in his childhood. When he reached man&rsquo;s estate, he became atree-pruner at Faverolles. His mother was named Jeanne Mathieu; his fatherwas called Jean Valjean or Vlajean, probably a sobriquet, and acontraction of <i>voilà</i> Jean, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s Jean.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition whichconstitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures. On the whole,however, there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant aboutJean Valjean in appearance, at least. He had lost his father and mother ata very early age. His mother had died of a milk fever, which had not beenproperly attended to. His father, a tree-pruner, like himself, had beenkilled by a fall from a tree. All that remained to Jean Valjean was asister older than himself,&mdash;a widow with seven children, boys andgirls. This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, and so long as she had ahusband she lodged and fed her young brother.</p><p>The husband died. The eldest of the seven children was eight years old.The youngest, one.</p><p>Jean Valjean had just attained his twenty-fifth year. He took the father&rsquo;splace, and, in his turn, supported the sister who had brought him up. Thiswas done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly on the part of JeanValjean. Thus his youth had been spent in rude and ill-paid toil. He hadnever known a &ldquo;kind woman friend&rdquo; in his native parts. He had not had thetime to fall in love.</p><p>He returned at night weary, and ate his broth without uttering a word. Hissister, mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast from hisbowl while he was eating,&mdash;a bit of meat, a slice of bacon, the heartof the cabbage,&mdash;to give to one of her children. As he went oneating, with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup, hislong hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes, he had the airof perceiving nothing and allowing it. There was at Faverolles, not farfrom the Valjean thatched cottage, on the other side of the lane, afarmer&rsquo;s wife named Marie-Claude; the Valjean children, habituallyfamished, sometimes went to borrow from Marie-Claude a pint of milk, intheir mother&rsquo;s name, which they drank behind a hedge or in some alleycorner, snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little girlsspilled it on their aprons and down their necks. If their mother had knownof this marauding, she would have punished the delinquents severely. JeanValjean gruffly and grumblingly paid Marie-Claude for the pint of milkbehind their mother&rsquo;s back, and the children were not punished.</p><p>In pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day; then he hired out as ahay-maker, as laborer, as neat-herd on a farm, as a drudge. He didwhatever he could. His sister worked also but what could she do with sevenlittle children? It was a sad group enveloped in misery, which was beinggradually annihilated. A very hard winter came. Jean had no work. Thefamily had no bread. No bread literally. Seven children!</p><p>One Sunday evening, Maubert Isabeau, the baker on the Church Square atFaverolles, was preparing to go to bed, when he heard a violent blow onthe grated front of his shop. He arrived in time to see an arm passedthrough a hole made by a blow from a fist, through the grating and theglass. The arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off. Isabeau ran outin haste; the robber fled at the full speed of his legs. Isabeau ran afterhim and stopped him. The thief had flung away the loaf, but his arm wasstill bleeding. It was Jean Valjean.</p><p>This took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunals ofthe time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at night.He had a gun which he used better than any one else in the world, he was abit of a poacher, and this injured his case. There exists a legitimateprejudice against poachers. The poacher, like the smuggler, smacks toostrongly of the brigand. Nevertheless, we will remark cursorily, there isstill an abyss between these races of men and the hideous assassin of thetowns. The poacher lives in the forest, the smuggler lives in themountains or on the sea. The cities make ferocious men because they makecorrupt men. The mountain, the sea, the forest, make savage men; theydevelop the fierce side, but often without destroying the humane side.</p><p>Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty. The terms of the Code were explicit.There occur formidable hours in our civilization; there are moments whenthe penal laws decree a shipwreck. What an ominous minute is that in whichsociety draws back and consummates the irreparable abandonment of asentient being! Jean Valjean was condemned to five years in the galleys.</p><p>On the 22d of April, 1796, the victory of Montenotte, won by thegeneral-in-chief of the army of Italy, whom the message of the Directoryto the Five Hundred, of the 2d of Floréal, year IV., calls Buona-Parte,was announced in Paris; on that same day a great gang of galley-slaves wasput in chains at Bicêtre. Jean Valjean formed a part of that gang. An oldturnkey of the prison, who is now nearly eighty years old, still recallsperfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of the fourthline, in the north angle of the courtyard. He was seated on the groundlike the others. He did not seem to comprehend his position, except thatit was horrible. It is probable that he, also, was disentangling from amidthe vague ideas of a poor man, ignorant of everything, somethingexcessive. While the bolt of his iron collar was being riveted behind hishead with heavy blows from the hammer, he wept, his tears stifled him,they impeded his speech; he only managed to say from time to time, &ldquo;I wasa tree-pruner at Faverolles.&rdquo; Then still sobbing, he raised his right handand lowered it gradually seven times, as though he were touching insuccession seven heads of unequal heights, and from this gesture it wasdivined that the thing which he had done, whatever it was, he had done forthe sake of clothing and nourishing seven little children.</p><p>He set out for Toulon. He arrived there, after a journey of twenty-sevendays, on a cart, with a chain on his neck. At Toulon he was clothed in thered cassock. All that had constituted his life, even to his name, waseffaced; he was no longer even Jean Valjean; he was number 24,601. Whatbecame of his sister? What became of the seven children? Who troubledhimself about that? What becomes of the handful of leaves from the youngtree which is sawed off at the root?</p><p>It is always the same story. These poor living beings, these creatures ofGod, henceforth without support, without guide, without refuge, wanderedaway at random,&mdash;who even knows?&mdash;each in his own directionperhaps, and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist whichengulfs solitary destinies; gloomy shades, into which disappear insuccession so many unlucky heads, in the sombre march of the human race.They quitted the country. The clock-tower of what had been their villageforgot them; the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them;after a few years&rsquo; residence in the galleys, Jean Valjean himself forgotthem. In that heart, where there had been a wound, there was a scar. Thatis all. Only once, during all the time which he spent at Toulon, did hehear his sister mentioned. This happened, I think, towards the end of thefourth year of his captivity. I know not through what channels the newsreached him. Some one who had known them in their own country had seen hissister. She was in Paris. She lived in a poor street near Saint-Sulpice,in the Rue du Gindre. She had with her only one child, a little boy, theyoungest. Where were the other six? Perhaps she did not know herself.Every morning she went to a printing office, No. 3 Rue du Sabot, where shewas a folder and stitcher. She was obliged to be there at six o&rsquo;clock inthe morning&mdash;long before daylight in winter. In the same buildingwith the printing office there was a school, and to this school she tookher little boy, who was seven years old. But as she entered the printingoffice at six, and the school only opened at seven, the child had to waitin the courtyard, for the school to open, for an hour&mdash;one hour of awinter night in the open air! They would not allow the child to come intothe printing office, because he was in the way, they said. When theworkmen passed in the morning, they beheld this poor little being seatedon the pavement, overcome with drowsiness, and often fast asleep in theshadow, crouched down and doubled up over his basket. When it rained, anold woman, the portress, took pity on him; she took him into her den,where there was a pallet, a spinning-wheel, and two wooden chairs, and thelittle one slumbered in a corner, pressing himself close to the cat thathe might suffer less from cold. At seven o&rsquo;clock the school opened, and heentered. That is what was told to Jean Valjean.</p><p>They talked to him about it for one day; it was a moment, a flash, asthough a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those thingswhom he had loved; then all closed again. He heard nothing more forever.Nothing from them ever reached him again; he never beheld them; he nevermet them again; and in the continuation of this mournful history they willnot be met with any more.</p><p>Towards the end of this fourth year Jean Valjean&rsquo;s turn to escape arrived.His comrades assisted him, as is the custom in that sad place. He escaped.He wandered for two days in the fields at liberty, if being at liberty isto be hunted, to turn the head every instant, to quake at the slightestnoise, to be afraid of everything,&mdash;of a smoking roof, of a passingman, of a barking dog, of a galloping horse, of a striking clock, of theday because one can see, of the night because one cannot see, of thehighway, of the path, of a bush, of sleep. On the evening of the secondday he was captured. He had neither eaten nor slept for thirty-six hours.The maritime tribunal condemned him, for this crime, to a prolongation ofhis term for three years, which made eight years. In the sixth year histurn to escape occurred again; he availed himself of it, but could notaccomplish his flight fully. He was missing at roll-call. The cannon werefired, and at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vesselin process of construction; he resisted the galley guards who seized him.Escape and rebellion. This case, provided for by a special code, waspunished by an addition of five years, two of them in the double chain.Thirteen years. In the tenth year his turn came round again; he againprofited by it; he succeeded no better. Three years for this freshattempt. Sixteen years. Finally, I think it was during his thirteenthyear, he made a last attempt, and only succeeded in getting retaken at theend of four hours of absence. Three years for those four hours. Nineteenyears. In October, 1815, he was released; he had entered there in 1796,for having broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread.</p><p>Room for a brief parenthesis. This is the second time, during his studieson the penal question and damnation by law, that the author of this bookhas come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of departure forthe disaster of a destiny. Claude Gaux had stolen a loaf; Jean Valjean hadstolen a loaf. English statistics prove the fact that four thefts out offive in London have hunger for their immediate cause.</p><p>Jean Valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering; he emergedimpassive. He had entered in despair; he emerged gloomy.</p><p>What had taken place in that soul?</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0021" id="link2HCH0021"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE INTERIOR OF DESPAIR</h3><p>Let us try to say it.</p><p>It is necessary that society should look at these things, because it isitself which creates them.</p><p>He was, as we have said, an ignorant man, but he was not a fool. The lightof nature was ignited in him. Unhappiness, which also possesses aclearness of vision of its own, augmented the small amount of daylightwhich existed in this mind. Beneath the cudgel, beneath the chain, in thecell, in hardship, beneath the burning sun of the galleys, upon the plankbed of the convict, he withdrew into his own consciousness and meditated.</p><p>He constituted himself the tribunal.</p><p>He began by putting himself on trial.</p><p>He recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished.He admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy act; thatthat loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to him had heasked for it; that, in any case, it would have been better to wait untilhe could get it through compassion or through work; that it is not anunanswerable argument to say, &ldquo;Can one wait when one is hungry?&rdquo; That, inthe first place, it is very rare for any one to die of hunger, literally;and next, that, fortunately or unfortunately, man is so constituted thathe can suffer long and much, both morally and physically, without dying;that it is therefore necessary to have patience; that that would even havebeen better for those poor little children; that it had been an act ofmadness for him, a miserable, unfortunate wretch, to take society at largeviolently by the collar, and to imagine that one can escape from miserythrough theft; that that is in any case a poor door through which toescape from misery through which infamy enters; in short, that he was inthe wrong.</p><p>Then he asked himself:&mdash;</p><p>Whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history. Whether itwas not a serious thing, that he, a laborer, out of work, that he, anindustrious man, should have lacked bread. And whether, the fault oncecommitted and confessed, the chastisement had not been ferocious anddisproportioned. Whether there had not been more abuse on the part of thelaw, in respect to the penalty, than there had been on the part of theculprit in respect to his fault. Whether there had not been an excess ofweights in one balance of the scale, in the one which contains expiation.Whether the over-weight of the penalty was not equivalent to theannihilation of the crime, and did not result in reversing the situation,of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the repression,of converting the guilty man into the victim, and the debtor into thecreditor, and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the man who hadviolated it.</p><p>Whether this penalty, complicated by successive aggravations for attemptsat escape, had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage perpetrated by thestronger upon the feebler, a crime of society against the individual, acrime which was being committed afresh every day, a crime which had lastednineteen years.</p><p>He asked himself whether human society could have the right to force itsmembers to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack offoresight, and in the other case for its pitiless foresight; and to seizea poor man forever between a defect and an excess, a default of work andan excess of punishment.</p><p>Whether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely those ofits members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods madeby chance, and consequently the most deserving of consideration.</p><p>These questions put and answered, he judged society and condemned it.</p><p>He condemned it to his hatred.</p><p>He made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering, and he said tohimself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call it toaccount. He declared to himself that there was no equilibrium between theharm which he had caused and the harm which was being done to him; hefinally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was not, in truth,unjust, but that it most assuredly was iniquitous.</p><p>Anger may be both foolish and absurd; one can be irritated wrongfully; oneis exasperated only when there is some show of right on one&rsquo;s side atbottom. Jean Valjean felt himself exasperated.</p><p>And besides, human society had done him nothing but harm; he had neverseen anything of it save that angry face which it calls Justice, and whichit shows to those whom it strikes. Men had only touched him to bruise him.Every contact with them had been a blow. Never, since his infancy, sincethe days of his mother, of his sister, had he ever encountered a friendlyword and a kindly glance. From suffering to suffering, he had graduallyarrived at the conviction that life is a war; and that in this war he wasthe conquered. He had no other weapon than his hate. He resolved to whetit in the galleys and to bear it away with him when he departed.</p><p>There was at Toulon a school for the convicts, kept by the Ignorantinfriars, where the most necessary branches were taught to those of theunfortunate men who had a mind for them. He was of the number who had amind. He went to school at the age of forty, and learned to read, towrite, to cipher. He felt that to fortify his intelligence was to fortifyhis hate. In certain cases, education and enlightenment can serve to ekeout evil.</p><p>This is a sad thing to say; after having judged society, which had causedhis unhappiness, he judged Providence, which had made society, and hecondemned it also.</p><p>Thus during nineteen years of torture and slavery, this soul mounted andat the same time fell. Light entered it on one side, and darkness on theother.</p><p>Jean Valjean had not, as we have seen, an evil nature. He was still goodwhen he arrived at the galleys. He there condemned society, and felt thathe was becoming wicked; he there condemned Providence, and was consciousthat he was becoming impious.</p><p>It is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point.</p><p>Does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom? Can the mancreated good by God be rendered wicked by man? Can the soul be completelymade over by fate, and become evil, fate being evil? Can the heart becomemisshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under theoppression of a disproportionate unhappiness, as the vertebral columnbeneath too low a vault? Is there not in every human soul, was there notin the soul of Jean Valjean in particular, a first spark, a divineelement, incorruptible in this world, immortal in the other, which goodcan develop, fan, ignite, and make to glow with splendor, and which evilcan never wholly extinguish?</p><p>Grave and obscure questions, to the last of which every physiologist wouldprobably have responded no, and that without hesitation, had he beheld atToulon, during the hours of repose, which were for Jean Valjean hours ofreverie, this gloomy galley-slave, seated with folded arms upon the bar ofsome capstan, with the end of his chain thrust into his pocket to preventits dragging, serious, silent, and thoughtful, a pariah of the laws whichregarded the man with wrath, condemned by civilization, and regardingheaven with severity.</p><p>Certainly,&mdash;and we make no attempt to dissimulate the fact,&mdash;theobserving physiologist would have beheld an irremediable misery; he would,perchance, have pitied this sick man, of the law&rsquo;s making; but he wouldnot have even essayed any treatment; he would have turned aside his gazefrom the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpse within this soul,and, like Dante at the portals of hell, he would have effaced from thisexistence the word which the finger of God has, nevertheless, inscribedupon the brow of every man,&mdash;hope.</p><p>Was this state of his soul, which we have attempted to analyze, asperfectly clear to Jean Valjean as we have tried to render it for thosewho read us? Did Jean Valjean distinctly perceive, after their formation,and had he seen distinctly during the process of their formation, all theelements of which his moral misery was composed? Had this rough andunlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception of the succession ofideas through which he had, by degrees, mounted and descended to thelugubrious aspects which had, for so many years, formed the inner horizonof his spirit? Was he conscious of all that passed within him, and of allthat was working there? That is something which we do not presume tostate; it is something which we do not even believe. There was too muchignorance in Jean Valjean, even after his misfortune, to prevent muchvagueness from still lingering there. At times he did not rightly knowhimself what he felt. Jean Valjean was in the shadows; he suffered in theshadows; he hated in the shadows; one might have said that he hated inadvance of himself. He dwelt habitually in this shadow, feeling his waylike a blind man and a dreamer. Only, at intervals, there suddenly came tohim, from without and from within, an access of wrath, a surcharge ofsuffering, a livid and rapid flash which illuminated his whole soul, andcaused to appear abruptly all around him, in front, behind, amid thegleams of a frightful light, the hideous precipices and the sombreperspective of his destiny.</p><p>The flash passed, the night closed in again; and where was he? He nolonger knew. The peculiarity of pains of this nature, in which that whichis pitiless&mdash;that is to say, that which is brutalizing&mdash;predominates,is to transform a man, little by little, by a sort of stupidtransfiguration, into a wild beast; sometimes into a ferocious beast.</p><p>Jean Valjean&rsquo;s successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alonesuffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul. JeanValjean would have renewed these attempts, utterly useless and foolish asthey were, as often as the opportunity had presented itself, withoutreflecting for an instant on the result, nor on the experiences which hehad already gone through. He escaped impetuously, like the wolf who findshis cage open. Instinct said to him, &ldquo;Flee!&rdquo; Reason would have said,&ldquo;Remain!&rdquo; But in the presence of so violent a temptation, reason vanished;nothing remained but instinct. The beast alone acted. When he wasrecaptured, the fresh severities inflicted on him only served to renderhim still more wild.</p><p>One detail, which we must not omit, is that he possessed a physicalstrength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of thegalleys. At work, at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan, JeanValjean was worth four men. He sometimes lifted and sustained enormousweights on his back; and when the occasion demanded it, he replaced thatimplement which is called a jack-screw, and was formerly called <i>orgueil</i>[pride], whence, we may remark in passing, is derived the name of the RueMontorgueil, near the Halles [Fishmarket] in Paris. His comrades hadnicknamed him Jean the Jack-screw. Once, when they were repairing thebalcony of the town-hall at Toulon, one of those admirable caryatids ofPuget, which support the balcony, became loosened, and was on the point offalling. Jean Valjean, who was present, supported the caryatid with hisshoulder, and gave the workmen time to arrive.</p><p>His suppleness even exceeded his strength. Certain convicts who wereforever dreaming of escape, ended by making a veritable science of forceand skill combined. It is the science of muscles. An entire system ofmysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners, men who are foreverenvious of the flies and birds. To climb a vertical surface, and to findpoints of support where hardly a projection was visible, was play to JeanValjean. An angle of the wall being given, with the tension of his backand legs, with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness of thestone, he raised himself as if by magic to the third story. He sometimesmounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison.</p><p>He spoke but little. He laughed not at all. An excessive emotion wasrequired to wring from him, once or twice a year, that lugubrious laugh ofthe convict, which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon. To allappearance, he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation ofsomething terrible.</p><p>He was absorbed, in fact.</p><p>Athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushedintelligence, he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing wasresting on him. In that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled,each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance, heperceived with terror, mingled with rage, a sort of frightful accumulationof things, collecting and mounting above him, beyond the range of hisvision,&mdash;laws, prejudices, men, and deeds,&mdash;whose outlinesescaped him, whose mass terrified him, and which was nothing else thanthat prodigious pyramid which we call civilization. He distinguished, hereand there in that swarming and formless mass, now near him, now afar offand on inaccessible table-lands, some group, some detail, vividlyilluminated; here the galley-sergeant and his cudgel; there the gendarmeand his sword; yonder the mitred archbishop; away at the top, like a sortof sun, the Emperor, crowned and dazzling. It seemed to him that thesedistant splendors, far from dissipating his night, rendered it morefunereal and more black. All this&mdash;laws, prejudices, deeds, men,things&mdash;went and came above him, over his head, in accordance withthe complicated and mysterious movement which God imparts to civilization,walking over him and crushing him with I know not what peacefulness in itscruelty and inexorability in its indifference. Souls which have fallen tothe bottom of all possible misfortune, unhappy men lost in the lowest ofthose limbos at which no one any longer looks, the reproved of the law,feel the whole weight of this human society, so formidable for him who iswithout, so frightful for him who is beneath, resting upon their heads.</p><p>In this situation Jean Valjean meditated; and what could be the nature ofhis meditation?</p><p>If the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts, it would,doubtless, think that same thing which Jean Valjean thought.</p><p>All these things, realities full of spectres, phantasmagories full ofrealities, had eventually created for him a sort of interior state whichis almost indescribable.</p><p>At times, amid his convict toil, he paused. He fell to thinking. Hisreason, at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore,rose in revolt. Everything which had happened to him seemed to him absurd;everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible. He said tohimself, &ldquo;It is a dream.&rdquo; He gazed at the galley-sergeant standing a fewpaces from him; the galley-sergeant seemed a phantom to him. All of asudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel.</p><p>Visible nature hardly existed for him. It would almost be true to say thatthere existed for Jean Valjean neither sun, nor fine summer days, norradiant sky, nor fresh April dawns. I know not what vent-hole daylighthabitually illumined his soul.</p><p>To sum up, in conclusion, that which can be summed up and translated intopositive results in all that we have just pointed out, we will confineourselves to the statement that, in the course of nineteen years, JeanValjean, the inoffensive tree-pruner of Faverolles, the formidable convictof Toulon, had become capable, thanks to the manner in which the galleyshad moulded him, of two sorts of evil action: firstly, of evil actionwhich was rapid, unpremeditated, dashing, entirely instinctive, in thenature of reprisals for the evil which he had undergone; secondly, of evilaction which was serious, grave, consciously argued out and premeditated,with the false ideas which such a misfortune can furnish. His deliberatedeeds passed through three successive phases, which natures of a certainstamp can alone traverse,&mdash;reasoning, will, perseverance. He had formoving causes his habitual wrath, bitterness of soul, a profound sense ofindignities suffered, the reaction even against the good, the innocent,and the just, if there are any such. The point of departure, like thepoint of arrival, for all his thoughts, was hatred of human law; thathatred which, if it be not arrested in its development by someprovidential incident, becomes, within a given time, the hatred ofsociety, then the hatred of the human race, then the hatred of creation,and which manifests itself by a vague, incessant, and brutal desire to doharm to some living being, no matter whom. It will be perceived that itwas not without reason that Jean Valjean&rsquo;s passport described him as <i>avery dangerous man</i>.</p><p>From year to year this soul had dried away slowly, but with fatalsureness. When the heart is dry, the eye is dry. On his departure from thegalleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0022" id="link2HCH0022"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;BILLOWS AND SHADOWS</h3><p>A man overboard!</p><p>What matters it?

But it wasnot long before this ray paled. Jean Valjean had been dazzled by the ideaof liberty. He had believed in a new life. He very speedily perceived whatsort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is provided.</p><p>And this was encompassed with much bitterness. He had calculated that hisearnings, during his sojourn in the galleys, ought to amount to a hundredand seventy-one francs. It is but just to add that he had forgotten toinclude in his calculations the forced repose of Sundays and festival daysduring nineteen years, which entailed a diminution of about eighty francs.At all events, his hoard had been reduced by various local levies to thesum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous, which had been countedout to him on his departure. He had understood nothing of this, and hadthought himself wronged. Let us say the word&mdash;robbed.</p><p>On the day following his liberation, he saw, at Grasse, in front of anorange-flower distillery, some men engaged in unloading bales. He offeredhis services. Business was pressing; they were accepted. He set to work.He was intelligent, robust, adroit; he did his best; the master seemedpleased. While he was at work, a gendarme passed, observed him, anddemanded his papers. It was necessary to show him the yellow passport.That done, Jean Valjean resumed his labor. A little while before he hadquestioned one of the workmen as to the amount which they earned each dayat this occupation; he had been told <i>thirty sous</i>. When eveningarrived, as he was forced to set out again on the following day, hepresented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be paid.The owner did not utter a word, but handed him fifteen sous. He objected.He was told, <i>&ldquo;That is enough for thee.&rdquo;</i> He persisted.

It was nearly twenty yearssince he had slept in a bed, and, although he had not undressed, thesensation was too novel not to disturb his slumbers.</p><p>He had slept more than four hours. His fatigue had passed away. He wasaccustomed not to devote many hours to repose.</p><p>He opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him; then heclosed them again, with the intention of going to sleep once more.</p><p>When many varied sensations have agitated the day, when various matterspreoccupy the mind, one falls asleep once, but not a second time. Sleepcomes more easily than it returns. This is what happened to Jean Valjean.He could not get to sleep again, and he fell to thinking.</p><p>He was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one&rsquo;smind are troubled. There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain. Hismemories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated therepell-mell and mingled confusedly, losing their proper forms, becomingdisproportionately large, then suddenly disappearing, as in a muddy andperturbed pool. Many thoughts occurred to him; but there was one whichkept constantly presenting itself afresh, and which drove away all others.We will mention this thought at once: he had observed the six sets ofsilver forks and spoons and the ladle which Madame Magloire had placed onthe table.</p><p>Those six sets of silver haunted him.&mdash;They were there.&mdash;A fewpaces distant.&mdash;Just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reachthe one in which he then was, the old servant-woman had been in the act ofplacing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed.&mdash;He hadtaken careful note of this cupboard.&mdash;On the right, as you enteredfrom the dining-room.&mdash;They were solid.&mdash;And old silver.&mdash;Fromthe ladle one could get at least two hundred francs.&mdash;Double what hehad earned in nineteen years.&mdash;It is true that he would have earnedmore if &ldquo;the <i>administration</i> had not <i>robbed him</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>His mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there wascertainly mingled some struggle. Three o&rsquo;clock struck. He opened his eyesagain, drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture, stretched out hisarm and felt of his knapsack, which he had thrown down on a corner of thealcove; then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed, and placed hisfeet on the floor, and thus found himself, almost without knowing it,seated on his bed.</p><p>He remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude, which would havebeen suggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen him thus inthe dark, the only person awake in that house where all were sleeping. Allof a sudden he stooped down, removed his shoes and placed them softly onthe mat beside the bed; then he resumed his thoughtful attitude, andbecame motionless once more.</p><p>Throughout this hideous meditation, the thoughts which we have aboveindicated moved incessantly through his brain; entered, withdrew,re-entered, and in a manner oppressed him; and then he thought, also,without knowing why, and with the mechanical persistence of reverie, of aconvict named Brevet, whom he had known in the galleys, and whose trousershad been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton. The checkeredpattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind.</p><p>He remained in this situation, and would have so remained indefinitely,even until daybreak, had not the clock struck one&mdash;the half orquarter hour. It seemed to him that that stroke said to him, &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p><p>He rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, and listened; all wasquiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, with short steps, tothe window, of which he caught a glimpse. The night was not very dark;there was a full moon, across which coursed large clouds driven by thewind. This created, outdoors, alternate shadow and gleams of light,eclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors a sort oftwilight. This twilight, sufficient to enable a person to see his way,intermittent on account of the clouds, resembled the sort of livid lightwhich falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before which the passers-bycome and go. On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean examined it. It hadno grating; it opened in the garden and was fastened, according to thefashion of the country, only by a small pin. He opened it; but as a rushof cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly, he closed it againimmediately. He scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze whichstudies rather than looks. The garden was enclosed by a tolerably lowwhite wall, easy to climb. Far away, at the extremity, he perceived topsof trees, spaced at regular intervals, which indicated that the wallseparated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees.</p><p>Having taken this survey, he executed a movement like that of a man whohas made up his mind, strode to his alcove, grasped his knapsack, openedit, fumbled in it, pulled out of it something which he placed on the bed,put his shoes into one of his pockets, shut the whole thing up again,threw the knapsack on his shoulders, put on his cap, drew the visor downover his eyes, felt for his cudgel, went and placed it in the angle of thewindow; then returned to the bed, and resolutely seized the object whichhe had deposited there. It resembled a short bar of iron, pointed like apike at one end. It would have been difficult to distinguish in thatdarkness for what employment that bit of iron could have been designed.Perhaps it was a lever; possibly it was a club.</p><p>In the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing morethan a miner&rsquo;s candlestick. Convicts were, at that period, sometimesemployed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which environ Toulon, andit was not rare for them to have miners&rsquo; tools at their command. Theseminers&rsquo; candlesticks are of massive iron, terminated at the lowerextremity by a point, by means of which they are stuck into the rock.</p><p>He took the candlestick in his right hand; holding his breath and tryingto deaden the sound of his tread, he directed his steps to the door of theadjoining room, occupied by the Bishop, as we already know.</p><p>On arriving at this door, he found it ajar. The Bishop had not closed it.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0025" id="link2HCH0025"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;WHAT HE DOES</h3><p>Jean Valjean listened. Not a sound.</p><p>He gave the door a push.</p><p>He pushed it gently with the tip of his finger, lightly, with the furtiveand uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering.</p><p>The door yielded to this pressure, and made an imperceptible and silentmovement, which enlarged the opening a little.</p><p>He waited a moment; then gave the door a second and a bolder push.</p><p>It continued to yield in silence. The opening was now large enough toallow him to pass. But near the door there stood a little table, whichformed an embarrassing angle with it, and barred the entrance.</p><p>Jean Valjean recognized the difficulty. It was necessary, at any cost, toenlarge the aperture still further.</p><p>He decided on his course of action, and gave the door a third push, moreenergetic than the two preceding. This time a badly oiled hinge suddenlyemitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry.</p><p>Jean Valjean shuddered. The noise of the hinge rang in his ears withsomething of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the Day ofJudgment.</p><p>In the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined thatthat hinge had just become animated, and had suddenly assumed a terriblelife, and that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one, and warn andto wake those who were asleep. He halted, shuddering, bewildered, and fellback from the tips of his toes upon his heels. He heard the arteries inhis temples beating like two forge hammers, and it seemed to him that hisbreath issued from his breast with the roar of the wind issuing from acavern. It seemed impossible to him that the horrible clamor of thatirritated hinge should not have disturbed the entire household, like theshock of an earthquake; the door, pushed by him, had taken the alarm, andhad shouted; the old man would rise at once; the two old women wouldshriek out; people would come to their assistance; in less than a quarterof an hour the town would be in an uproar, and the gendarmerie on hand.For a moment he thought himself lost.</p><p>He remained where he was, petrified like the statue of salt, not daring tomake a movement. Several minutes elapsed. The door had fallen wide open.He ventured to peep into the next room. Nothing had stirred there. He lentan ear. Nothing was moving in the house. The noise made by the rusty hingehad not awakened any one.</p><p>This first danger was past; but there still reigned a frightful tumultwithin him. Nevertheless, he did not retreat. Even when he had thoughthimself lost, he had not drawn back. His only thought now was to finish assoon as possible. He took a step and entered the room.</p><p>This room was in a state of perfect calm. Here and there vague andconfused forms were distinguishable, which in the daylight were papersscattered on a table, open folios, volumes piled upon a stool, anarmchair heaped with clothing, a prie-Dieu, and which at that hour wereonly shadowy corners and whitish spots. Jean Valjean advanced withprecaution, taking care not to knock against the furniture. He could hear,at the extremity of the room, the even and tranquil breathing of thesleeping Bishop.</p><p>He suddenly came to a halt. He was near the bed. He had arrived theresooner than he had thought for.</p><p>Nature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with our actionswith sombre and intelligent appropriateness, as though she desired to makeus reflect. For the last half-hour a large cloud had covered the heavens.At the moment when Jean Valjean paused in front of the bed, this cloudparted, as though on purpose, and a ray of light, traversing the longwindow, suddenly illuminated the Bishop&rsquo;s pale face. He was sleepingpeacefully. He lay in his bed almost completely dressed, on account of thecold of the Basses-Alps, in a garment of brown wool, which covered hisarms to the wrists. His head was thrown back on the pillow, in thecareless attitude of repose; his hand, adorned with the pastoral ring, andwhence had fallen so many good deeds and so many holy actions, was hangingover the edge of the bed. His whole face was illumined with a vagueexpression of satisfaction, of hope, and of felicity. It was more than asmile, and almost a radiance. He bore upon his brow the indescribablereflection of a light which was invisible. The soul of the justcontemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven.</p><p>A reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop.</p><p>It was, at the same time, a luminous transparency, for that heaven waswithin him. That heaven was his conscience.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0008" id="linkimage-0008"></a><img alt="The Fall" src="images/1b2-10-the-fall.jpg" width="100%" /></div><p>At the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself, so to speak,upon that inward radiance, the sleeping Bishop seemed as in a glory. Itremained, however, gentle and veiled in an ineffable half-light. That moonin the sky, that slumbering nature, that garden without a quiver, thathouse which was so calm, the hour, the moment, the silence, added somesolemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man, andenveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white hair, thoseclosed eyes, that face in which all was hope and all was confidence, thathead of an old man, and that slumber of an infant.</p><p>There was something almost divine in this man, who was thus august,without being himself aware of it.</p><p>Jean Valjean was in the shadow, and stood motionless, with his ironcandlestick in his hand, frightened by this luminous old man. Never had hebeheld anything like this. This confidence terrified him. The moral worldhas no grander spectacle than this: a troubled and uneasy conscience,which has arrived on the brink of an evil action, contemplating theslumber of the just.</p><p>That slumber in that isolation, and with a neighbor like himself, hadabout it something sublime, of which he was vaguely but imperiouslyconscious.</p><p>No one could have told what was passing within him, not even himself. Inorder to attempt to form an idea of it, it is necessary to think of themost violent of things in the presence of the most gentle. Even on hisvisage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything withcertainty. It was a sort of haggard astonishment. He gazed at it, and thatwas all. But what was his thought? It would have been impossible to divineit. What was evident was, that he was touched and astounded. But what wasthe nature of this emotion?</p><p>His eye never quitted the old man. The only thing which was clearly to beinferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange indecision.One would have said that he was hesitating between the two abysses,&mdash;theone in which one loses one&rsquo;s self and that in which one saves one&rsquo;s self.He seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss that hand.</p><p>At the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards hisbrow, and he took off his cap; then his arm fell back with the samedeliberation, and Jean Valjean fell to meditating once more, his cap inhis left hand, his club in his right hand, his hair bristling all over hissavage head.</p><p>The Bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifyinggaze.</p><p>The gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over thechimney-piece, which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them, witha benediction for one and pardon for the other.</p><p>Suddenly Jean Valjean replaced his cap on his brow; then stepped rapidlypast the bed, without glancing at the Bishop, straight to the cupboard,which he saw near the head; he raised his iron candlestick as though toforce the lock; the key was there; he opened it; the first thing whichpresented itself to him was the basket of silverware; he seized it,traversed the chamber with long strides, without taking any precautionsand without troubling himself about the noise, gained the door, re-enteredthe oratory, opened the window, seized his cudgel, bestrode thewindow-sill of the ground floor, put the silver into his knapsack, threwaway the basket, crossed the garden, leaped over the wall like a tiger,and fled.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0026" id="link2HCH0026"></a>CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE BISHOP WORKS</h3><p>The next morning at sunrise Monseigneur Bienvenu was strolling in hisgarden. Madame Magloire ran up to him in utter consternation.</p><p>&ldquo;Monseigneur, Monseigneur!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;does your Grace know where thebasket of silver is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Bishop.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus the Lord be blessed!&rdquo; she resumed; &ldquo;I did not know what had becomeof it.&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower-bed. He presented itto Madame Magloire.</p><p>&ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Nothing in it! And the silver?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; returned the Bishop, &ldquo;so it is the silver which troubles you? Idon&rsquo;t know where it is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Great, good God! It is stolen! That man who was here last night hasstolen it.&rdquo;</p><p>In a twinkling, with all the vivacity of an alert old woman, MadameMagloire had rushed to the oratory, entered the alcove, and returned tothe Bishop. The Bishop had just bent down, and was sighing as he examineda plant of cochlearia des Guillons, which the basket had broken as it fellacross the bed. He rose up at Madame Magloire&rsquo;s cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Monseigneur, the man is gone! The silver has been stolen!&rdquo;</p><p>As she uttered this exclamation, her eyes fell upon a corner of thegarden, where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible. Thecoping of the wall had been torn away.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay! yonder is the way he went. He jumped over into Cochefilet Lane. Ah,the abomination! He has stolen our silver!&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he raised his grave eyes,and said gently to Madame Magloire:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And, in the first place, was that silver ours?&rdquo;</p><p>Madame Magloire was speechless. Another silence ensued; then the Bishopwent on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Madame Magloire, I have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully.It belonged to the poor. Who was that man? A poor man, evidently.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alas! Jesus!&rdquo; returned Madame Magloire. &ldquo;It is not for my sake, nor forMademoiselle&rsquo;s. It makes no difference to us. But it is for the sake ofMonseigneur. What is Monseigneur to eat with now?&rdquo;</p><p>The Bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, come! Are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons?&rdquo;</p><p>Madame Magloire shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;Pewter has an odor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Iron forks and spoons, then.&rdquo;</p><p>Madame Magloire made an expressive grimace.</p><p>&ldquo;Iron has a taste.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Bishop; &ldquo;wooden ones then.&rdquo;</p><p>A few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which JeanValjean had sat on the previous evening. As he ate his breakfast,Monseigneur Welcome remarked gayly to his sister, who said nothing, and toMadame Magloire, who was grumbling under her breath, that one really doesnot need either fork or spoon, even of wood, in order to dip a bit ofbread in a cup of milk.</p><p>&ldquo;A pretty idea, truly,&rdquo; said Madame Magloire to herself, as she went andcame, &ldquo;to take in a man like that! and to lodge him close to one&rsquo;s self!And how fortunate that he did nothing but steal! Ah, mon Dieu! it makesone shudder to think of it!&rdquo;</p><p>As the brother and sister were about to rise from the table, there came aknock at the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the Bishop.</p><p>The door opened. A singular and violent group made its appearance on thethreshold. Three men were holding a fourth man by the collar. The threemen were gendarmes; the other was Jean Valjean.</p><p>A brigadier of gendarmes, who seemed to be in command of the group, wasstanding near the door. He entered and advanced to the Bishop, making amilitary salute.</p><p>&ldquo;Monseigneur&mdash;&rdquo; said he.</p><p>At this word, Jean Valjean, who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed,raised his head with an air of stupefaction.</p><p>&ldquo;Monseigneur!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;So he is not the curé?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said the gendarme. &ldquo;He is Monseigneur the Bishop.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, Monseigneur Bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his greatage permitted.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! here you are!&rdquo; he exclaimed, looking at Jean Valjean. &ldquo;I am glad tosee you. Well, but how is this? I gave you the candlesticks too, which areof silver like the rest, and for which you can certainly get two hundredfrancs. Why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean opened his eyes wide, and stared at the venerable Bishop withan expression which no human tongue can render any account of.</p><p>&ldquo;Monseigneur,&rdquo; said the brigadier of gendarmes, &ldquo;so what this man said istrue, then? We came across him. He was walking like a man who is runningaway. We stopped him to look into the matter. He had this silver&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And he told you,&rdquo; interposed the Bishop with a smile, &ldquo;that it had beengiven to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed thenight? I see how the matter stands. And you have brought him back here? Itis a mistake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; replied the brigadier, &ldquo;we can let him go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the Bishop.</p><p>The gendarmes released Jean Valjean, who recoiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it true that I am to be released?&rdquo; he said, in an almost inarticulatevoice, and as though he were talking in his sleep.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, thou art released; dost thou not understand?&rdquo; said one of thegendarmes.</p><p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; resumed the Bishop, &ldquo;before you go, here are yourcandlesticks. Take them.&rdquo;</p><p>He stepped to the chimney-piece, took the two silver candlesticks, andbrought them to Jean Valjean. The two women looked on without uttering aword, without a gesture, without a look which could disconcert the Bishop.</p><p>Jean Valjean was trembling in every limb. He took the two candlesticksmechanically, and with a bewildered air.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Bishop, &ldquo;go in peace. By the way, when you return, myfriend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden. You can alwaysenter and depart through the street door. It is never fastened withanything but a latch, either by day or by night.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, turning to the gendarmes:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You may retire, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p><p>The gendarmes retired.</p><p>Jean Valjean was like a man on the point of fainting.</p><p>The Bishop drew near to him, and said in a low voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do not forget, never forget, that you have promised to use this money inbecoming an honest man.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean, who had no recollection of ever having promised anything,remained speechless. The Bishop had emphasized the words when he utteredthem. He resumed with solemnity:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. Itis your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts andthe spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0027" id="link2HCH0027"></a>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;LITTLE GERVAIS</h3><p>Jean Valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it. He set outat a very hasty pace through the fields, taking whatever roads and pathspresented themselves to him, without perceiving that he was incessantlyretracing his steps. He wandered thus the whole morning, without havingeaten anything and without feeling hungry. He was the prey of a throng ofnovel sensations. He was conscious of a sort of rage; he did not knowagainst whom it was directed. He could not have told whether he wastouched or humiliated. There came over him at moments a strange emotionwhich he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during thelast twenty years of his life. This state of mind fatigued him. Heperceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the injusticeof his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within him. Heasked himself what would replace this. At times he would have actuallypreferred to be in prison with the gendarmes, and that things should nothave happened in this way; it would have agitated him less. Although theseason was tolerably far advanced, there were still a few late flowers inthe hedge-rows here and there, whose odor as he passed through them in hismarch recalled to him memories of his childhood. These memories werealmost intolerable to him, it was so long since they had recurred to him.</p><p>Unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long.</p><p>As the sun declined to its setting, casting long shadows athwart the soilfrom every pebble, Jean Valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large ruddyplain, which was absolutely deserted. There was nothing on the horizonexcept the Alps. Not even the spire of a distant village. Jean Valjeanmight have been three leagues distant from D&mdash;&mdash; A path whichintersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush.</p><p>In the middle of this meditation, which would have contributed not alittle to render his rags terrifying to any one who might have encounteredhim, a joyous sound became audible.</p><p>He turned his head and saw a little Savoyard, about ten years of age,coming up the path and singing, his hurdy-gurdy on his hip, and hismarmot-box on his back.</p><p>One of those gay and gentle children, who go from land to land affording aview of their knees through the holes in their trousers.</p><p>Without stopping his song, the lad halted in his march from time to time,and played at knuckle-bones with some coins which he had in his hand&mdash;hiswhole fortune, probably.</p><p>Among this money there was one forty-sou piece.</p><p>The child halted beside the bush, without perceiving Jean Valjean, andtossed up his handful of sous, which, up to that time, he had caught witha good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand.</p><p>This time the forty-sou piece escaped him, and went rolling towards thebrushwood until it reached Jean Valjean.</p><p>Jean Valjean set his foot upon it.</p><p>In the meantime, the child had looked after his coin and had caught sightof him.</p><p>He showed no astonishment, but walked straight up to the man.</p><p>The spot was absolutely solitary. As far as the eye could see there wasnot a person on the plain or on the path. The only sound was the tiny,feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage, which was traversing theheavens at an immense height. The child was standing with his back to thesun, which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with itsblood-red gleam the savage face of Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the little Savoyard, with that childish confidence which iscomposed of ignorance and innocence, &ldquo;my money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;Little Gervais, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; resumed the child, &ldquo;give me back my money.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean dropped his head, and made no reply.</p><p>The child began again, &ldquo;My money, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean&rsquo;s eyes remained fixed on the earth.</p><p>&ldquo;My piece of money!&rdquo; cried the child, &ldquo;my white piece! my silver!&rdquo;</p><p>It seemed as though Jean Valjean did not hear him. The child grasped himby the collar of his blouse and shook him. At the same time he made aneffort to displace the big iron-shod shoe which rested on his treasure.</p><p>&ldquo;I want my piece of money! my piece of forty sous!&rdquo;</p><p>The child wept. Jean Valjean raised his head. He still remained seated.His eyes were troubled. He gazed at the child, in a sort of amazement,then he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a terriblevoice, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I, sir,&rdquo; replied the child. &ldquo;Little Gervais! I! Give me back my fortysous, if you please! Take your foot away, sir, if you please!&rdquo;</p><p>Then irritated, though he was so small, and becoming almost menacing:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Come now, will you take your foot away? Take your foot away, or we&rsquo;llsee!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! It&rsquo;s still you!&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, and rising abruptly to his feet,his foot still resting on the silver piece, he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you take yourself off!&rdquo;</p><p>The frightened child looked at him, then began to tremble from head tofoot, and after a few moments of stupor he set out, running at the top ofhis speed, without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry.</p><p>Nevertheless, lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain distance,and Jean Valjean heard him sobbing, in the midst of his own reverie.</p><p>At the end of a few moments the child had disappeared.</p><p>The sun had set.</p><p>The shadows were descending around Jean Valjean. He had eaten nothing allday; it is probable that he was feverish.</p><p>He had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after thechild&rsquo;s flight. The breath heaved his chest at long and irregularintervals. His gaze, fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him, seemed tobe scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient fragmentof blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass. All at once heshivered; he had just begun to feel the chill of evening.</p><p>He settled his cap more firmly on his brow, sought mechanically to crossand button his blouse, advanced a step and stopped to pick up his cudgel.</p><p>At that moment he caught sight of the forty-sou piece, which his foot hadhalf ground into the earth, and which was shining among the pebbles. Itwas as though he had received a galvanic shock. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; hemuttered between his teeth. He recoiled three paces, then halted, withoutbeing able to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had trodden butan instant before, as though the thing which lay glittering there in thegloom had been an open eye riveted upon him.</p><p>At the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards thesilver coin, seized it, and straightened himself up again and began togaze afar off over the plain, at the same time casting his eyes towardsall points of the horizon, as he stood there erect and shivering, like aterrified wild animal which is seeking refuge.</p><p>He saw nothing. Night was falling, the plain was cold and vague, greatbanks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight.</p><p>He said, &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child haddisappeared. After about thirty paces he paused, looked about him and sawnothing.</p><p>Then he shouted with all his might:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Little Gervais! Little Gervais!&rdquo;</p><p>He paused and waited.</p><p>There was no reply.</p><p>The landscape was gloomy and deserted. He was encompassed by space. Therewas nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was lost, and asilence which engulfed his voice.</p><p>An icy north wind was blowing, and imparted to things around him a sort oflugubrious life. The bushes shook their thin little arms with incrediblefury. One would have said that they were threatening and pursuing someone.</p><p>He set out on his march again, then he began to run; and from time to timehe halted and shouted into that solitude, with a voice which was the mostformidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to hear, &ldquo;LittleGervais! Little Gervais!&rdquo;</p><p>Assuredly, if the child had heard him, he would have been alarmed andwould have taken good care not to show himself. But the child was no doubtalready far away.</p><p>He encountered a priest on horseback. He stepped up to him and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Curé, have you seen a child pass?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the priest.</p><p>&ldquo;One named Little Gervais?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have seen no one.&rdquo;</p><p>He drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag and handed them to thepriest.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Curé, this is for your poor people. Monsieur le Curé, he wasa little lad, about ten years old, with a marmot, I think, and ahurdy-gurdy. One of those Savoyards, you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have not seen him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Little Gervais? There are no villages here? Can you tell me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If he is like what you say, my friend, he is a little stranger. Suchpersons pass through these parts. We know nothing of them.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence, andgave them to the priest.</p><p>&ldquo;For your poor,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Then he added, wildly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur l&rsquo;Abbé, have me arrested. I am a thief.&rdquo;</p><p>The priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste, much alarmed.</p><p>Jean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had first taken.</p><p>In this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, calling,shouting, but he met no one. Two or three times he ran across the plaintowards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human beingreclining or crouching down; it turned out to be nothing but brushwood orrocks nearly on a level with the earth. At length, at a spot where threepaths intersected each other, he stopped. The moon had risen. He sent hisgaze into the distance and shouted for the last time, &ldquo;Little Gervais!Little Gervais! Little Gervais!&rdquo; His shout died away in the mist, withouteven awakening an echo. He murmured yet once more, &ldquo;Little Gervais!&rdquo; butin a feeble and almost inarticulate voice. It was his last effort; hislegs gave way abruptly under him, as though an invisible power hadsuddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil conscience; he fellexhausted, on a large stone, his fists clenched in his hair and his faceon his knees, and he cried, &ldquo;I am a wretch!&rdquo;</p><p>Then his heart burst, and he began to cry. It was the first time that hehad wept in nineteen years.</p><p>When Jean Valjean left the Bishop&rsquo;s house, he was, as we have seen, quitethrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto. He could notyield to the evidence of what was going on within him. He hardened himselfagainst the angelic action and the gentle words of the old man. &ldquo;You havepromised me to become an honest man. I buy your soul. I take it away fromthe spirit of perversity; I give it to the good God.&rdquo;</p><p>This recurred to his mind unceasingly. To this celestial kindness heopposed pride, which is the fortress of evil within us. He wasindistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatestassault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet; that hisobduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency; that if heyielded, he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which theactions of other men had filled his soul through so many years, and whichpleased him; that this time it was necessary to conquer or to beconquered; and that a struggle, a colossal and final struggle, had beenbegun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man.</p><p>In the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who isintoxicated. As he walked thus with haggard eyes, did he have a distinctperception of what might result to him from his adventure at D&mdash;&mdash;?Did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune thespirit at certain moments of life? Did a voice whisper in his ear that hehad just passed the solemn hour of his destiny; that there no longerremained a middle course for him; that if he were not henceforth the bestof men, he would be the worst; that it behooved him now, so to speak, tomount higher than the Bishop, or fall lower than the convict; that if hewished to become good he must become an angel; that if he wished to remainevil, he must become a monster?</p><p>Here, again, some questions must be put, which we have already put toourselves elsewhere: did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought,in a confused way? Misfortune certainly, as we have said, does form theeducation of the intelligence; nevertheless, it is doubtful whether JeanValjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have here indicated.If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught glimpses of, rather than sawthem, and they only succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable andalmost painful state of emotion. On emerging from that black and deformedthing which is called the galleys, the Bishop had hurt his soul, as toovivid a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark. Thefuture life, the possible life which offered itself to him henceforth, allpure and radiant, filled him with tremors and anxiety. He no longer knewwhere he really was. Like an owl, who should suddenly see the sun rise,the convict had been dazzled and blinded, as it were, by virtue.</p><p>That which was certain, that which he did not doubt, was that he was nolonger the same man, that everything about him was changed, that it was nolonger in his power to make it as though the Bishop had not spoken to himand had not touched him.</p><p>In this state of mind he had encountered little Gervais, and had robbedhim of his forty sous. Why? He certainly could not have explained it; wasthis the last effect and the supreme effort, as it were, of the evilthoughts which he had brought away from the galleys,&mdash;a remnant ofimpulse, a result of what is called in statics, <i>acquired force?</i> Itwas that, and it was also, perhaps, even less than that. Let us say itsimply, it was not he who stole; it was not the man; it was the beast,who, by habit and instinct, had simply placed his foot upon that money,while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hithertounheard-of thoughts besetting it.</p><p>When intelligence reawakened and beheld that action of the brute, JeanValjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009"></a><img src="images/1b2-11-awakened.jpg" alt="Awakened" width="100%" /></div><p>It was because,&mdash;strange phenomenon, and one which was possible onlyin the situation in which he found himself,&mdash;in stealing the moneyfrom that child, he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable.</p><p>However that may be, this last evil action had a decisive effect on him;it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind, and dispersedit, placed on one side the thick obscurity, and on the other the light,and acted on his soul, in the state in which it then was, as certainchemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating one elementand clarifying the other.</p><p>First of all, even before examining himself and reflecting, allbewildered, like one who seeks to save himself, he tried to find the childin order to return his money to him; then, when he recognized the factthat this was impossible, he halted in despair. At the moment when heexclaimed &ldquo;I am a wretch!&rdquo; he had just perceived what he was, and he wasalready separated from himself to such a degree, that he seemed to himselfto be no longer anything more than a phantom, and as if he had, therebefore him, in flesh and blood, the hideous galley-convict, Jean Valjean,cudgel in hand, his blouse on his hips, his knapsack filled with stolenobjects on his back, with his resolute and gloomy visage, with histhoughts filled with abominable projects.</p><p>Excess of unhappiness had, as we have remarked, made him in some sort avisionary. This, then, was in the nature of a vision. He actually saw thatJean Valjean, that sinister face, before him. He had almost reached thepoint of asking himself who that man was, and he was horrified by him.</p><p>His brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calmmoments in which reverie is so profound that it absorbs reality. One nolonger beholds the object which one has before one, and one sees, asthough apart from one&rsquo;s self, the figures which one has in one&rsquo;s own mind.</p><p>Thus he contemplated himself, so to speak, face to face, and at the sametime, athwart this hallucination, he perceived in a mysterious depth asort of light which he at first took for a torch. On scrutinizing thislight which appeared to his conscience with more attention, he recognizedthe fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch was theBishop.</p><p>His conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it,&mdash;theBishop and Jean Valjean. Nothing less than the first was required tosoften the second. By one of those singular effects, which are peculiar tothis sort of ecstasies, in proportion as his reverie continued, as theBishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes, so did Jean Valjean growless and vanish. After a certain time he was no longer anything more thana shade. All at once he disappeared. The Bishop alone remained; he filledthe whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance.</p><p>Jean Valjean wept for a long time. He wept burning tears, he sobbed withmore weakness than a woman, with more fright than a child.</p><p>As he wept, daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul; anextraordinary light; a light at once ravishing and terrible. His pastlife, his first fault, his long expiation, his external brutishness, hisinternal hardness, his dismissal to liberty, rejoicing in manifold plansof vengeance, what had happened to him at the Bishop&rsquo;s, the last thingthat he had done, that theft of forty sous from a child, a crime all themore cowardly, and all the more monstrous since it had come after theBishop&rsquo;s pardon,&mdash;all this recurred to his mind and appeared clearlyto him, but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed. Heexamined his life, and it seemed horrible to him; his soul, and it seemedfrightful to him. In the meantime a gentle light rested over this life andthis soul. It seemed to him that he beheld Satan by the light of Paradise.</p><p>How many hours did he weep thus? What did he do after he had wept? Whitherdid he go! No one ever knew. The only thing which seems to beauthenticated is that that same night the carrier who served Grenoble atthat epoch, and who arrived at D&mdash;&mdash; about three o&rsquo;clock in themorning, saw, as he traversed the street in which the Bishop&rsquo;s residencewas situated, a man in the attitude of prayer, kneeling on the pavement inthe shadow, in front of the door of Monseigneur Welcome.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0034" id="link2H_4_0034"></a>BOOK THIRD&mdash;IN THE YEAR 1817</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0028" id="link2HCH0028"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE YEAR 1817</h3><p>1817 is the year which Louis XVIII., with a certain royal assurance whichwas not wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of his reign. It isthe year in which M. Bruguière de Sorsum was celebrated. All thehairdressers&rsquo; shops, hoping for powder and the return of the royal bird,were besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs-de-lys. It was the candidtime at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as church-warden in thechurch-warden&rsquo;s pew of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, in his costume of a peer ofFrance, with his red ribbon and his long nose and the majesty of profilepeculiar to a man who has performed a brilliant action. The brilliantaction performed by M. Lynch was this: being mayor of Bordeaux, on the12th of March, 1814, he had surrendered the city a little too promptly toM. the Duke d&rsquo;Angoulême. Hence his peerage. In 1817 fashion swallowed uplittle boys of from four to six years of age in vast caps of moroccoleather with ear-tabs resembling Esquimaux mitres. The French army wasdressed in white, after the mode of the Austrian; the regiments werecalled legions; instead of numbers they bore the names of departments;Napoleon was at St. Helena; and since England refused him green cloth, hewas having his old coats turned. In 1817 Pelligrini sang; MademoiselleBigottini danced; Potier reigned; Odry did not yet exist. Madame Saqui hadsucceeded to Forioso. There were still Prussians in France. M. Delalot wasa personage. Legitimacy had just asserted itself by cutting off the hand,then the head, of Pleignier, of Carbonneau, and of Tolleron. The Prince deTalleyrand, grand chamberlain, and the Abbé Louis, appointed minister offinance, laughed as they looked at each other, with the laugh of the twoaugurs; both of them had celebrated, on the 14th of July, 1790, the massof federation in the Champ de Mars; Talleyrand had said it as bishop,Louis had served it in the capacity of deacon. In 1817, in the side-alleysof this same Champ de Mars, two great cylinders of wood might have beenseen lying in the rain, rotting amid the grass, painted blue, with tracesof eagles and bees, from which the gilding was falling. These were thecolumns which two years before had upheld the Emperor&rsquo;s platform in theChamp de Mai. They were blackened here and there with the scorches of thebivouac of Austrians encamped near Gros-Caillou. Two or three of thesecolumns had disappeared in these bivouac fires, and had warmed the largehands of the Imperial troops. The Field of May had this remarkable point:that it had been held in the month of June and in the Field of March(Mars). In this year, 1817, two things were popular: the Voltaire-Touquetand the snuff-box <i>à la Charter</i>. The most recent Parisian sensationwas the crime of Dautun, who had thrown his brother&rsquo;s head into thefountain of the Flower-Market.</p><p>They had begun to feel anxious at the Naval Department, on account of thelack of news from that fatal frigate, <i>The Medusa</i>, which wasdestined to cover Chaumareix with infamy and Géricault with glory. ColonelSelves was going to Egypt to become Soliman-Pasha. The palace of Thermes,in the Rue de La Harpe, served as a shop for a cooper. On the platform ofthe octagonal tower of the Hotel de Cluny, the little shed of boards,which had served as an observatory to Messier, the naval astronomer underLouis XVI., was still to be seen. The Duchesse de Duras read to three orfour friends her unpublished <i>Ourika</i>, in her boudoir furnished by X.in sky-blue satin. The N&rsquo;s were scratched off the Louvre. The bridge ofAusterlitz had abdicated, and was entitled the bridge of the King&rsquo;s Garden[du Jardin du Roi], a double enigma, which disguised the bridge ofAusterlitz and the Jardin des Plantes at one stroke. Louis XVIII., muchpreoccupied while annotating Horace with the corner of his finger-nail,heroes who have become emperors, and makers of wooden shoes who havebecome dauphins, had two anxieties,&mdash;Napoleon and Mathurin Bruneau.The French Academy had given for its prize subject, <i>The Happinessprocured through Study</i>. M. Bellart was officially eloquent. In hisshadow could be seen germinating that future advocate-general of Broë,dedicated to the sarcasms of Paul-Louis Courier. There was a falseChateaubriand, named Marchangy, in the interim, until there should be afalse Marchangy, named d&rsquo;Arlincourt. <i>Claire d&rsquo;Albe</i> and <i>Malek-Adel</i>were masterpieces; Madame Cottin was proclaimed the chief writer of theepoch. The Institute had the academician, Napoleon Bonaparte, strickenfrom its list of members. A royal ordinance erected Angoulême into a navalschool; for the Duc d&rsquo;Angoulême, being lord high admiral, it was evidentthat the city of Angoulême had all the qualities of a seaport; otherwisethe monarchical principle would have received a wound. In the Council ofMinisters the question was agitated whether vignettes representingslack-rope performances, which adorned Franconi&rsquo;s advertising posters, andwhich attracted throngs of street urchins, should be tolerated. M. Paër,the author of <i>Agnese</i>, a good sort of fellow, with a square face anda wart on his cheek, directed the little private concerts of the Marquisede Sasenaye in the Rue Ville l&rsquo;Évêque. All the young girls were singingthe <i>Hermit of Saint-Avelle</i>, with words by Edmond Géraud. <i>TheYellow Dwarf</i> was transferred into <i>Mirror</i>. The Café Lemblinstood up for the Emperor, against the Café Valois, which upheld theBourbons. The Duc de Berri, already surveyed from the shadow by Louvel,had just been married to a princess of Sicily. Madame de Staël had died ayear previously. The body-guard hissed Mademoiselle Mars. The grandnewspapers were all very small. Their form was restricted, but theirliberty was great. The <i>Constitutionnel</i> was constitutional. <i>LaMinerve</i> called Chateaubriand <i>Chateaubriant</i>. That <i>t</i> madethe good middle-class people laugh heartily at the expense of the greatwriter. In journals which sold themselves, prostituted journalists,insulted the exiles of 1815. David had no longer any talent, Arnault hadno longer any wit, Carnot was no longer honest, Soult had won no battles;it is true that Napoleon had no longer any genius. No one is ignorant ofthe fact that letters sent to an exile by post very rarely reached him, asthe police made it their religious duty to intercept them. This is no newfact; Descartes complained of it in his exile. Now David, having, in aBelgian publication, shown some displeasure at not receiving letters whichhad been written to him, it struck the royalist journals as amusing; andthey derided the prescribed man well on this occasion. What separated twomen more than an abyss was to say, the <i>regicides</i>, or to say the <i>voters</i>;to say the <i>enemies</i>, or to say the <i>allies</i>; to say <i>Napoleon</i>,or to say <i>Buonaparte</i>. All sensible people were agreed that the eraof revolution had been closed forever by King Louis XVIII., surnamed &ldquo;TheImmortal Author of the Charter.&rdquo; On the platform of the Pont-Neuf, theword <i>Redivivus</i> was carved on the pedestal that awaited the statueof Henry IV. M. Piet, in the Rue Thérèse, No. 4, was making the roughdraft of his privy assembly to consolidate the monarchy. The leaders ofthe Right said at grave conjunctures, &ldquo;We must write to Bacot.&rdquo; MM.Canuel, O&rsquo;Mahoney, and De Chappedelaine were preparing the sketch, to someextent with Monsieur&rsquo;s approval, of what was to become later on &ldquo;TheConspiracy of the Bord de l&rsquo;Eau&rdquo;&mdash;of the waterside. L&rsquo;Épingle Noirewas already plotting in his own quarter. Delaverderie was conferring withTrogoff. M. Decazes, who was liberal to a degree, reigned. Chateaubriandstood every morning at his window at No. 27 Rue Saint-Dominique, clad infooted trousers, and slippers, with a madras kerchief knotted over hisgray hair, with his eyes fixed on a mirror, a complete set of dentist&rsquo;sinstruments spread out before him, cleaning his teeth, which werecharming, while he dictated <i>The Monarchy according to the Charter</i>to M. Pilorge, his secretary. Criticism, assuming an authoritative tone,preferred Lafon to Talma. M. de Féletez signed himself A.; M. Hoffmannsigned himself Z. Charles Nodier wrote <i>Thérèse Aubert</i>. Divorce wasabolished. Lyceums called themselves colleges. The collegians, decoratedon the collar with a golden fleur-de-lys, fought each other <i>apropos</i>of the King of Rome. The counter-police of the château had denounced toher Royal Highness Madame, the portrait, everywhere exhibited, of M. theDuc d&rsquo;Orléans, who made a better appearance in his uniform of acolonel-general of hussars than M. the Duc de Berri, in his uniform ofcolonel-general of dragoons&mdash;a serious inconvenience. The city ofParis was having the dome of the Invalides regilded at its own expense.Serious men asked themselves what M. de Trinquelague would do on such orsuch an occasion; M. Clausel de Montals differed on divers points from M.Clausel de Coussergues; M. de Salaberry was not satisfied. The comedianPicard, who belonged to the Academy, which the comedian Molière had notbeen able to do, had <i>The Two Philiberts</i> played at the Odéon, uponwhose pediment the removal of the letters still allowed THEATRE OF THEEMPRESS to be plainly read. People took part for or against Cugnet deMontarlot. Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was revolutionary. The Liberal,Pélicier, published an edition of Voltaire, with the following title: <i>Worksof Voltaire</i>, of the French Academy. &ldquo;That will attract purchasers,&rdquo; said the ingenious editor. The general opinion was that M. Charles Loysonwould be the genius of the century; envy was beginning to gnaw at him&mdash;asign of glory; and this verse was composed on him:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Even when Loyson steals, one feels that he has paws.&rdquo;</p><p>As Cardinal Fesch refused to resign, M. de Pins, Archbishop of Amasie,administered the diocese of Lyons. The quarrel over the valley of Dappeswas begun between Switzerland and France by a memoir from Captain,afterwards General Dufour. Saint-Simon, ignored, was erecting his sublimedream. There was a celebrated Fourier at the Academy of Science, whomposterity has forgotten; and in some garret an obscure Fourier, whom thefuture will recall. Lord Byron was beginning to make his mark; a note to apoem by Millevoye introduced him to France in these terms: <i>a certainLord Baron</i>. David d&rsquo;Angers was trying to work in marble. The AbbéCaron was speaking, in terms of praise, to a private gathering ofseminarists in the blind alley of Feuillantines, of an unknown priest,named Félicité-Robert, who, at a latter date, became Lamennais. A thingwhich smoked and clattered on the Seine with the noise of a swimming dogwent and came beneath the windows of the Tuileries, from the Pont Royal tothe Pont Louis XV.; it was a piece of mechanism which was not good formuch; a sort of plaything, the idle dream of a dream-ridden inventor; anutopia&mdash;a steamboat. The Parisians stared indifferently at thisuseless thing. M. de Vaublanc, the reformer of the Institute by a coupd&rsquo;état, the distinguished author of numerous academicians, ordinances, andbatches of members, after having created them, could not succeed inbecoming one himself. The Faubourg Saint-Germain and the pavilion deMarsan wished to have M. Delaveau for prefect of police, on account of hispiety. Dupuytren and Récamier entered into a quarrel in the amphitheatreof the School of Medicine, and threatened each other with their fists onthe subject of the divinity of Jesus Christ. Cuvier, with one eye onGenesis and the other on nature, tried to please bigoted reaction byreconciling fossils with texts and by making mastodons flatter Moses.</p><p>M. François de Neufchâteau, the praiseworthy cultivator of the memory ofParmentier, made a thousand efforts to have <i>pomme de terre</i> [potato]pronounced <i>parmentière</i>, and succeeded therein not at all. The AbbéGrégoire, ex-bishop, ex-conventionary, ex-senator, had passed, in theroyalist polemics, to the state of &ldquo;Infamous Grégoire.&rdquo; The locution ofwhich we have made use&mdash;<i>passed to the state of</i>&mdash;has beencondemned as a neologism by M. Royer Collard. Under the third arch of thePont de Jéna, the new stone with which, the two years previously, themining aperture made by Blücher to blow up the bridge had been stopped up,was still recognizable on account of its whiteness. Justice summoned toits bar a man who, on seeing the Comte d&rsquo;Artois enter Notre Dame, had saidaloud: <i>&ldquo;Sapristi! I regret the time when I saw Bonaparte and Talmaenter the Bel Sauvage, arm in arm.&rdquo;</i> A seditious utterance. Six monthsin prison. Traitors showed themselves unbuttoned; men who had gone over tothe enemy on the eve of battle made no secret of their recompense, andstrutted immodestly in the light of day, in the cynicism of riches anddignities; deserters from Ligny and Quatre-Bras, in the brazenness oftheir well-paid turpitude, exhibited their devotion to the monarchy in themost barefaced manner.</p><p>This is what floats up confusedly, pell-mell, for the year 1817, and isnow forgotten. History neglects nearly all these particulars, and cannotdo otherwise; the infinity would overwhelm it. Nevertheless, thesedetails, which are wrongly called trivial,&mdash;there are no trivialfacts in humanity, nor little leaves in vegetation,&mdash;are useful. Itis of the physiognomy of the years that the physiognomy of the centuriesis composed. In this year of 1817 four young Parisians arranged &ldquo;a finefarce.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0029" id="link2HCH0029"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;A DOUBLE QUARTETTE</h3><p>These Parisians came, one from Toulouse, another from Limoges, the thirdfrom Cahors, and the fourth from Montauban; but they were students; andwhen one says student, one says Parisian: to study in Paris is to be bornin Paris.</p><p>These young men were insignificant; every one has seen such faces; fourspecimens of humanity taken at random; neither good nor bad, neither wisenor ignorant, neither geniuses nor fools; handsome, with that charmingApril which is called twenty years. They were four Oscars; for, at thatepoch, Arthurs did not yet exist. <i>Burn for him the perfumes of Araby!</i>exclaimed romance. <i>Oscar advances. Oscar, I shall behold him!</i>People had just emerged from Ossian; elegance was Scandinavian andCaledonian; the pure English style was only to prevail later, and thefirst of the Arthurs, Wellington, had but just won the battle of Waterloo.</p><p>These Oscars bore the names, one of Félix Tholomyès, of Toulouse; thesecond, Listolier, of Cahors; the next, Fameuil, of Limoges; the last,Blachevelle, of Montauban. Naturally, each of them had his mistress.Blachevelle loved Favourite, so named because she had been in England;Listolier adored Dahlia, who had taken for her nickname the name of aflower; Fameuil idolized Zéphine, an abridgment of Joséphine; Tholomyèshad Fantine, called the Blonde, because of her beautiful, sunny hair.</p><p>Favourite, Dahlia, Zéphine, and Fantine were four ravishing young women,perfumed and radiant, still a little like working-women, and not yetentirely divorced from their needles; somewhat disturbed by intrigues, butstill retaining on their faces something of the serenity of toil, and intheir souls that flower of honesty which survives the first fall in woman.One of the four was called the young, because she was the youngest ofthem, and one was called the old; the old one was twenty-three. Not toconceal anything, the three first were more experienced, more heedless,and more emancipated into the tumult of life than Fantine the Blonde, whowas still in her first illusions.</p><p>Dahlia, Zéphine, and especially Favourite, could not have said as much.There had already been more than one episode in their romance, thoughhardly begun; and the lover who had borne the name of Adolph in the firstchapter had turned out to be Alphonse in the second, and Gustave in thethird. Poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors; one scolds and theother flatters, and the beautiful daughters of the people have both ofthem whispering in their ear, each on its own side. These badly guardedsouls listen. Hence the falls which they accomplish, and the stones whichare thrown at them. They are overwhelmed with splendor of all that isimmaculate and inaccessible. Alas! what if the Jungfrau were hungry?</p><p>Favourite having been in England, was admired by Dahlia and Zéphine. Shehad had an establishment of her own very early in life. Her father was anold unmarried professor of mathematics, a brutal man and a braggart, whowent out to give lessons in spite of his age. This professor, when he wasa young man, had one day seen a chambermaid&rsquo;s gown catch on a fender; hehad fallen in love in consequence of this accident. The result had beenFavourite. She met her father from time to time, and he bowed to her. Onemorning an old woman with the air of a devotee, had entered herapartments, and had said to her, &ldquo;You do not know me, Mamemoiselle?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am your mother.&rdquo; Then the old woman opened the sideboard, and ate anddrank, had a mattress which she owned brought in, and installed herself.This cross and pious old mother never spoke to Favourite, remained hourswithout uttering a word, breakfasted, dined, and supped for four, and wentdown to the porter&rsquo;s quarters for company, where she spoke ill of herdaughter.</p><p>It was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn Dahlia toListolier, to others perhaps, to idleness. How could she make such nailswork? She who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her hands.As for Zéphine, she had conquered Fameuil by her roguish and caressinglittle way of saying &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>The young men were comrades; the young girls were friends. Such loves arealways accompanied by such friendships.</p><p>Goodness and philosophy are two distinct things; the proof of this isthat, after making all due allowances for these little irregularhouseholds, Favourite, Zéphine, and Dahlia were philosophical young women,while Fantine was a good girl.</p><p>Good! some one will exclaim; and Tholomyès? Solomon would reply that loveforms a part of wisdom. We will confine ourselves to saying that the loveof Fantine was a first love, a sole love, a faithful love.</p><p>She alone, of all the four, was not called &ldquo;thou&rdquo; by a single one of them.</p><p>Fantine was one of those beings who blossom, so to speak, from the dregsof the people. Though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths ofsocial shadow, she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous and theunknown. She was born at M. sur M. Of what parents? Who can say? She hadnever known father or mother. She was called Fantine. Why Fantine? She hadnever borne any other name. At the epoch of her birth the Directory stillexisted. She had no family name; she had no family; no baptismal name; theChurch no longer existed. She bore the name which pleased the first randompasser-by, who had encountered her, when a very small child, runningbare-legged in the street. She received the name as she received the waterfrom the clouds upon her brow when it rained. She was called littleFantine. No one knew more than that. This human creature had entered lifein just this way. At the age of ten, Fantine quitted the town and went toservice with some farmers in the neighborhood. At fifteen she came toParis &ldquo;to seek her fortune.&rdquo; Fantine was beautiful, and remained pure aslong as she could. She was a lovely blonde, with fine teeth. She had goldand pearls for her dowry; but her gold was on her head, and her pearlswere in her mouth.</p><p>She worked for her living; then, still for the sake of her living,&mdash;forthe heart, also, has its hunger,&mdash;she loved.</p><p>She loved Tholomyès.</p><p>An amour for him; passion for her. The streets of the Latin quarter,filled with throngs of students and grisettes, saw the beginning of theirdream. Fantine had long evaded Tholomyès in the mazes of the hill of thePantheon, where so many adventurers twine and untwine, but in such a wayas constantly to encounter him again. There is a way of avoiding whichresembles seeking. In short, the eclogue took place.</p><p>Blachevelle, Listolier, and Fameuil formed a sort of group of whichTholomyès was the head. It was he who possessed the wit.</p><p>Tholomyès was the antique old student; he was rich; he had an income offour thousand francs; four thousand francs! a splendid scandal on MountSainte-Geneviève. Tholomyès was a fast man of thirty, and badly preserved.He was wrinkled and toothless, and he had the beginning of a bald spot, ofwhich he himself said with sadness, <i>the skull at thirty, the knee atforty</i>. His digestion was mediocre, and he had been attacked by awatering in one eye. But in proportion as his youth disappeared, gayetywas kindled; he replaced his teeth with buffooneries, his hair with mirth,his health with irony, his weeping eye laughed incessantly. He wasdilapidated but still in flower. His youth, which was packing up fordeparture long before its time, beat a retreat in good order, burstingwith laughter, and no one saw anything but fire. He had had a piecerejected at the Vaudeville. He made a few verses now and then. In additionto this he doubted everything to the last degree, which is a vast force inthe eyes of the weak. Being thus ironical and bald, he was the leader. <i>Iron</i>is an English word. Is it possible that irony is derived from it?</p><p>One day Tholomyès took the three others aside, with the gesture of anoracle, and said to them:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Fantine, Dahlia, Zéphine, and Favourite have been teasing us for nearly ayear to give them a surprise. We have promised them solemnly that wewould. They are forever talking about it to us, to me in particular, justas the old women in Naples cry to Saint Januarius, &lsquo;<i>Faccia gialluta, fao miracolo</i>, Yellow face, perform thy miracle,&rsquo; so our beauties say tome incessantly, &lsquo;Tholomyès, when will you bring forth your surprise?&rsquo; Atthe same time our parents keep writing to us. Pressure on both sides. Themoment has arrived, it seems to me; let us discuss the question.&rdquo;</p><p>Thereupon, Tholomyès lowered his voice and articulated something somirthful, that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four mouthssimultaneously, and Blachevelle exclaimed, &ldquo;That is an idea.&rdquo;</p><p>A smoky tap-room presented itself; they entered, and the remainder oftheir confidential colloquy was lost in shadow.</p><p>The result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which took placeon the following Sunday, the four young men inviting the four young girls.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0030" id="link2HCH0030"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;FOUR AND FOUR</h3><p>It is hard nowadays to picture to one&rsquo;s self what a pleasure-trip ofstudents and grisettes to the country was like, forty-five years ago. Thesuburbs of Paris are no longer the same; the physiognomy of what may becalled circumparisian life has changed completely in the lasthalf-century; where there was the cuckoo, there is the railway car; wherethere was a tender-boat, there is now the steamboat; people speak ofFécamp nowadays as they spoke of Saint-Cloud in those days. The Paris of1862 is a city which has France for its outskirts.</p><p>The four couples conscientiously went through with all the country folliespossible at that time. The vacation was beginning, and it was a warm,bright, summer day. On the preceding day, Favourite, the only one who knewhow to write, had written the following to Tholomyès in the name of thefour: &ldquo;It is a good hour to emerge from happiness.&rdquo; That is why they roseat five o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Then they went to Saint-Cloud by thecoach, looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed, &ldquo;This must be verybeautiful when there is water!&rdquo; They breakfasted at the <i>Tête-Noir</i>,where Castaing had not yet been; they treated themselves to a game ofring-throwing under the quincunx of trees of the grand fountain; theyascended Diogenes&rsquo; lantern, they gambled for macaroons at the rouletteestablishment of the Pont de Sèvres, picked bouquets at Pateaux, boughtreed-pipes at Neuilly, ate apple tarts everywhere, and were perfectlyhappy.</p><p>The young girls rustled and chatted like warblers escaped from their cage.It was a perfect delirium. From time to time they bestowed little taps onthe young men. Matutinal intoxication of life! adorable years! the wingsof the dragonfly quiver. Oh, whoever you may be, do you not remember? Haveyou rambled through the brushwood, holding aside the branches, on accountof the charming head which is coming on behind you? Have you slid,laughing, down a slope all wet with rain, with a beloved woman holdingyour hand, and crying, &ldquo;Ah, my new boots! what a state they are in!&rdquo;</p><p>Let us say at once that that merry obstacle, a shower, was lacking in thecase of this good-humored party, although Favourite had said as they setout, with a magisterial and maternal tone, <i>&ldquo;The slugs are crawling inthe paths,&mdash;a sign of rain, children.&rdquo;</i></p><p>All four were madly pretty. A good old classic poet, then famous, a goodfellow who had an Éléonore, M. le Chevalier de Labouisse, as he strolledthat day beneath the chestnut-trees of Saint-Cloud, saw them pass aboutten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and exclaimed, &ldquo;There is one too many ofthem,&rdquo; as he thought of the Graces. Favourite, Blachevelle&rsquo;s friend, theone aged three and twenty, the old one, ran on in front under the greatgreen boughs, jumped the ditches, stalked distractedly over bushes, andpresided over this merry-making with the spirit of a young female faun.Zéphine and Dahlia, whom chance had made beautiful in such a way that theyset each off when they were together, and completed each other, never lefteach other, more from an instinct of coquetry than from friendship, andclinging to each other, they assumed English poses; the first <i>keepsakes</i>had just made their appearance, melancholy was dawning for women, as lateron, Byronism dawned for men; and the hair of the tender sex began to droopdolefully. Zéphine and Dahlia had their hair dressed in rolls. Listolierand Fameuil, who were engaged in discussing their professors, explained toFantine the difference that existed between M. Delvincourt and M.Blondeau.</p><p>Blachevelle seemed to have been created expressly to carry Favourite&rsquo;ssingle-bordered, imitation India shawl of Ternaux&rsquo;s manufacture, on hisarm on Sundays.</p><p>Tholomyès followed, dominating the group. He was very gay, but one feltthe force of government in him; there was dictation in his joviality; hisprincipal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant-leg pattern ofnankeen, with straps of braided copper wire; he carried a stout rattanworth two hundred francs in his hand, and, as he treated himself toeverything, a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth. Nothing wassacred to him; he smoked.</p><p>&ldquo;That Tholomyès is astounding!&rdquo; said the others, with veneration. &ldquo;Whattrousers! What energy!&rdquo;</p><p>As for Fantine, she was a joy to behold. Her splendid teeth had evidentlyreceived an office from God,&mdash;laughter. She preferred to carry herlittle hat of sewed straw, with its long white strings, in her hand ratherthan on her head. Her thick blond hair, which was inclined to wave, andwhich easily uncoiled, and which it was necessary to fasten upincessantly, seemed made for the flight of Galatea under the willows. Herrosy lips babbled enchantingly. The corners of her mouth voluptuouslyturned up, as in the antique masks of Erigone, had an air of encouragingthe audacious; but her long, shadowy lashes drooped discreetly over thejollity of the lower part of the face as though to call a halt. There wassomething indescribably harmonious and striking about her entire dress.She wore a gown of mauve barège, little reddish brown buskins, whoseribbons traced an X on her fine, white, open-worked stockings, and thatsort of muslin spencer, a Marseilles invention, whose name, <i>canezou</i>,a corruption of the words <i>quinze août</i>, pronounced after the fashionof the Canebière, signifies fine weather, heat, and midday. The threeothers, less timid, as we have already said, wore low-necked dresseswithout disguise, which in summer, beneath flower-adorned hats, are verygraceful and enticing; but by the side of these audacious outfits, blondFantine&rsquo;s <i>canezou</i>, with its transparencies, its indiscretion, andits reticence, concealing and displaying at one and the same time, seemedan alluring godsend of decency, and the famous Court of Love, presidedover by the Vicomtesse de Cette, with the sea-green eyes, would, perhaps,have awarded the prize for coquetry to this <i>canezou</i>, in the contestfor the prize of modesty. The most ingenious is, at times, the wisest.This does happen.</p><p>Brilliant of face, delicate of profile, with eyes of a deep blue, heavylids, feet arched and small, wrists and ankles admirably formed, a whiteskin which, here and there allowed the azure branching of the veins to beseen, joy, a cheek that was young and fresh, the robust throat of the Junoof Ægina, a strong and supple nape of the neck, shoulders modelled asthough by Coustou, with a voluptuous dimple in the middle, visible throughthe muslin; a gayety cooled by dreaminess; sculptural and exquisite&mdash;suchwas Fantine; and beneath these feminine adornments and these ribbons onecould divine a statue, and in that statue a soul.</p><p>Fantine was beautiful, without being too conscious of it. Those raredreamers, mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confronteverything with perfection, would have caught a glimpse in this littleworking-woman, through the transparency of her Parisian grace, of theancient sacred euphony. This daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred. Shewas beautiful in the two ways&mdash;style and rhythm. Style is the form ofthe ideal; rhythm is its movement.</p><p>We have said that Fantine was joy; she was also modesty.</p><p>To an observer who studied her attentively, that which breathed from herathwart all the intoxication of her age, the season, and her love affair,was an invincible expression of reserve and modesty. She remained a littleastonished. This chaste astonishment is the shade of difference whichseparates Psyche from Venus. Fantine had the long, white, fine fingers ofthe vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of the sacred fire with a goldenpin. Although she would have refused nothing to Tholomyès, as we shallhave more than ample opportunity to see, her face in repose was supremelyvirginal; a sort of serious and almost austere dignity suddenlyoverwhelmed her at certain times, and there was nothing more singular anddisturbing than to see gayety become so suddenly extinct there, andmeditation succeed to cheerfulness without any transition state. Thissudden and sometimes severely accentuated gravity resembled the disdain ofa goddess. Her brow, her nose, her chin, presented that equilibrium ofoutline which is quite distinct from equilibrium of proportion, and fromwhich harmony of countenance results; in the very characteristic intervalwhich separates the base of the nose from the upper lip, she had thatimperceptible and charming fold, a mysterious sign of chastity, whichmakes Barberousse fall in love with a Diana found in the treasures ofIconia.</p><p>Love is a fault; so be it. Fantine was innocence floating high over fault.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0031" id="link2HCH0031"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THOLOMYÈS IS SO MERRY THAT HE SINGS A SPANISH DITTY</h3><p>That day was composed of dawn, from one end to the other. All natureseemed to be having a holiday, and to be laughing. The flower-beds ofSaint-Cloud perfumed the air; the breath of the Seine rustled the leavesvaguely; the branches gesticulated in the wind, bees pillaged thejasmines; a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the yarrow, theclover, and the sterile oats; in the august park of the King of Francethere was a pack of vagabonds, the birds.</p><p>The four merry couples, mingled with the sun, the fields, the flowers, thetrees, were resplendent.</p><p>And in this community of Paradise, talking, singing, running, dancing,chasing butterflies, plucking convolvulus, wetting their pink, open-workstockings in the tall grass, fresh, wild, without malice, all received, tosome extent, the kisses of all, with the exception of Fantine, who washedged about with that vague resistance of hers composed of dreaminess andwildness, and who was in love. &ldquo;You always have a queer look about you,&rdquo; said Favourite to her.</p><p>Such things are joys. These passages of happy couples are a profoundappeal to life and nature, and make a caress and light spring forth fromeverything. There was once a fairy who created the fields and forestsexpressly for those in love,&mdash;in that eternal hedge-school of lovers,which is forever beginning anew, and which will last as long as there arehedges and scholars. Hence the popularity of spring among thinkers. Thepatrician and the knife-grinder, the duke and the peer, the limb of thelaw, the courtiers and townspeople, as they used to say in olden times,all are subjects of this fairy. They laugh and hunt, and there is in theair the brilliance of an apotheosis&mdash;what a transfiguration effectedby love! Notaries&rsquo; clerks are gods. And the little cries, the pursuitsthrough the grass, the waists embraced on the fly, those jargons which aremelodies, those adorations which burst forth in the manner of pronouncinga syllable, those cherries torn from one mouth by another,&mdash;all thisblazes forth and takes its place among the celestial glories. Beautifulwomen waste themselves sweetly. They think that this will never come to anend. Philosophers, poets, painters, observe these ecstasies and know notwhat to make of it, so greatly are they dazzled by it. The departure forCythera! exclaims Watteau; Lancret, the painter of plebeians, contemplateshis bourgeois, who have flitted away into the azure sky; Diderot stretchesout his arms to all these love idyls, and d&rsquo;Urfé mingles druids with them.</p><p>After breakfast the four couples went to what was then called the King&rsquo;sSquare to see a newly arrived plant from India, whose name escapes ourmemory at this moment, and which, at that epoch, was attracting all Paristo Saint-Cloud. It was an odd and charming shrub with a long stem, whosenumerous branches, bristling and leafless and as fine as threads, werecovered with a million tiny white rosettes; this gave the shrub the air ofa head of hair studded with flowers. There was always an admiring crowdabout it.</p><p>After viewing the shrub, Tholomyès exclaimed, &ldquo;I offer you asses!&rdquo; andhaving agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses, they returned byway of Vanvres and Issy. At Issy an incident occurred. The truly nationalpark, at that time owned by Bourguin the contractor, happened to be wideopen. They passed the gates, visited the manikin anchorite in his grotto,tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinet of mirrors, thewanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire or of Turcaretmetamorphosed into a Priapus. They had stoutly shaken the swing attachedto the two chestnut-trees celebrated by the Abbé de Bernis. As he swungthese beauties, one after the other, producing folds in the flutteringskirts which Greuze would have found to his taste, amid peals of laughter,the Toulousan Tholomyès, who was somewhat of a Spaniard, Toulouse beingthe cousin of Tolosa, sang, to a melancholy chant, the old ballad <i>gallega</i>,probably inspired by some lovely maid dashing in full flight upon a ropebetween two trees:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Soy de Badajoz,<br/>Amor me llama,<br/>Toda mi alma,<br/>Es en mi ojos,<br/>Porque enseñas,<br/>A tuas piernas.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Badajoz is my home,<br/>And Love is my name;<br/>To my eyes in flame,<br/>All my soul doth come;<br/>For instruction meet<br/>I receive at thy feet&rdquo;</p><p>Fantine alone refused to swing.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to have people put on airs like that,&rdquo; muttered Favourite,with a good deal of acrimony.</p><p>After leaving the asses there was a fresh delight; they crossed the Seinein a boat, and proceeding from Passy on foot they reached the barrier ofl&rsquo;Étoile. They had been up since five o&rsquo;clock that morning, as the readerwill remember; but <i>bah! there is no such thing as fatigue on Sunday</i>,said Favourite; <i>on Sunday fatigue does not work</i>.</p><p>About three o&rsquo;clock the four couples, frightened at their happiness, weresliding down the Russian mountains, a singular edifice which then occupiedthe heights of Beaujon, and whose undulating line was visible above thetrees of the Champs-Élysées.</p><p>From time to time Favourite exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And the surprise? I claim the surprise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Patience,&rdquo; replied Tholomyès.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0032" id="link2HCH0032"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;AT BOMBARDA&rsquo;S</h3><p>The Russian mountains having been exhausted, they began to think aboutdinner; and the radiant party of eight, somewhat weary at last, becamestranded in Bombarda&rsquo;s public house, a branch establishment which had beenset up in the Champs-Élysées by that famous restaurant-keeper, Bombarda,whose sign could then be seen in the Rue de Rivoli, near Delorme Alley.</p><p>A large but ugly room, with an alcove and a bed at the end (they had beenobliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the Sunday crowd);two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms, the quay and theriver; a magnificent August sunlight lightly touching the panes; twotables; upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets, mingled withthe hats of men and women; at the other the four couples seated round amerry confusion of platters, dishes, glasses, and bottles; jugs of beermingled with flasks of wine; very little order on the table, some disorderbeneath it;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;They made beneath the table<br />A noise, a clatter of the feet that was abominable,&rdquo;</p><p class="noindent">says Molière.</p><p>This was the state which the shepherd idyl, begun at five o&rsquo;clock in themorning, had reached at half-past four in the afternoon. The sun wassetting; their appetites were satisfied.</p><p>The Champs-Élysées, filled with sunshine and with people, were nothing butlight and dust, the two things of which glory is composed. The horses ofMarly, those neighing marbles, were prancing in a cloud of gold. Carriageswere going and coming. A squadron of magnificent body-guards, with theirclarions at their head, were descending the Avenue de Neuilly; the whiteflag, showing faintly rosy in the setting sun, floated over the dome ofthe Tuileries. The Place de la Concorde, which had become the Place LouisXV. once more, was choked with happy promenaders. Many wore the silverfleur-de-lys suspended from the white-watered ribbon, which had not yetwholly disappeared from button-holes in the year 1817. Here and therechoruses of little girls threw to the winds, amid the passers-by, whoformed into circles and applauded, the then celebrated Bourbon air, whichwas destined to strike the Hundred Days with lightning, and which had forits refrain:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Rendez-nous notre père de Gand,<br />Rendez-nous notre père.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Give us back our father from Ghent,<br />Give us back our father.&rdquo;</p><p>Groups of dwellers in the suburbs, in Sunday array, sometimes evendecorated with the fleur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, scattered over thelarge square and the Marigny square, were playing at rings and revolvingon the wooden horses; others were engaged in drinking; some journeymanprinters had on paper caps; their laughter was audible. Everything wasradiant. It was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist security;it was the epoch when a special and private report of Chief of PoliceAnglès to the King, on the subject of the suburbs of Paris, terminatedwith these lines:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Taking all things into consideration, Sire, there is nothing to be fearedfrom these people. They are as heedless and as indolent as cats. Thepopulace is restless in the provinces; it is not in Paris. These are verypretty men, Sire. It would take all of two of them to make one of yourgrenadiers. There is nothing to be feared on the part of the populace ofParis the capital. It is remarkable that the stature of this populationshould have diminished in the last fifty years; and the populace of thesuburbs is still more puny than at the time of the Revolution. It is notdangerous. In short, it is an amiable rabble.&rdquo;</p><p>Prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transformitself into a lion; that does happen, however, and in that lies themiracle wrought by the populace of Paris. Moreover, the cat so despised byCount Anglès possessed the esteem of the republics of old. In their eyesit was liberty incarnate; and as though to serve as pendant to the MinervaAptera of the Piræus, there stood on the public square in Corinth thecolossal bronze figure of a cat. The ingenuous police of the Restorationbeheld the populace of Paris in too &ldquo;rose-colored&rdquo; a light; it is not somuch of &ldquo;an amiable rabble&rdquo; as it is thought. The Parisian is to theFrenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek: no one sleeps more soundlythan he, no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than he, no one canbetter assume the air of forgetfulness; let him not be trustednevertheless; he is ready for any sort of cool deed; but when there isglory at the end of it, he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury.Give him a pike, he will produce the 10th of August; give him a gun, youwill have Austerlitz. He is Napoleon&rsquo;s stay and Danton&rsquo;s resource. Is it aquestion of country, he enlists; is it a question of liberty, he tears upthe pavements. Beware! his hair filled with wrath, is epic; his blousedrapes itself like the folds of a chlamys. Take care! he will make of thefirst Rue Grenétat which comes to hand Caudine Forks. When the hourstrikes, this man of the faubourgs will grow in stature; this little manwill arise, and his gaze will be terrible, and his breath will become atempest, and there will issue forth from that slender chest enough wind todisarrange the folds of the Alps. It is, thanks to the suburban man ofParis, that the Revolution, mixed with arms, conquers Europe. He sings; itis his delight. Proportion his song to his nature, and you will see! Aslong as he has for refrain nothing but <i>la Carmagnole</i>, he onlyoverthrows Louis XVI.; make him sing the <i>Marseillaise</i>, and he willfree the world.</p><p>This note jotted down on the margin of Anglès&rsquo; report, we will return toour four couples.

As soon as he comes in, hismother says to him: &lsquo;Ah! mon Dieu! my peace of mind is gone. There he goeswith his shouting.

Too much improvisation empties the mind in astupid way. Running beer gathers no froth. No haste, gentlemen. Let usmingle majesty with the feast. Let us eat with meditation; let us makehaste slowly.

All thefrogs held their peace.</p><p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; cried Tholomyès, with the accent of a man who had recovered hisempire, &ldquo;Come to yourselves. This pun which has fallen from the skies mustnot be received with too much stupor. Everything which falls in that wayis not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect. The pun is the dungof the mind which soars. The jest falls, no matter where; and the mindafter producing a piece of stupidity plunges into the azure depths. Awhitish speck flattened against the rock does not prevent the condor fromsoaring aloft. Far be it from me to insult the pun! I honor it inproportion to its merits; nothing more. All the most august, the mostsublime, the most charming of humanity, and perhaps outside of humanity,have made puns. Jesus Christ made a pun on St. Peter, Moses on Isaac,Æschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octavius. And observe that Cleopatra&rsquo;spun preceded the battle of Actium, and that had it not been for it, no onewould have remembered the city of Toryne, a Greek name which signifies aladle. That once conceded, I return to my exhortation. I repeat, brothers,I repeat, no zeal, no hubbub, no excess; even in witticisms, gayety,jollities, or plays on words. Listen to me. I have the prudence ofAmphiaraüs and the baldness of Cæsar. There must be a limit, even torebuses. <i>Est modus in rebus</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;There must be a limit, even to dinners. You are fond of apple turnovers,ladies; do not indulge in them to excess. Even in the matter of turnovers,good sense and art are requisite. Gluttony chastises the glutton, <i>Gulapunit Gulax</i>. Indigestion is charged by the good God with preachingmorality to stomachs. And remember this: each one of our passions, evenlove, has a stomach which must not be filled too full. In all things theword <i>finis</i> must be written in good season; self-control must beexercised when the matter becomes urgent; the bolt must be drawn onappetite; one must set one&rsquo;s own fantasy to the violin, and carry one&rsquo;sself to the post. The sage is the man who knows how, at a given moment, toeffect his own arrest. Have some confidence in me, for I have succeeded tosome extent in my study of the law, according to the verdict of myexaminations, for I know the difference between the question put and thequestion pending, for I have sustained a thesis in Latin upon the mannerin which torture was administered at Rome at the epoch when MunatiusDemens was quæstor of the Parricide; because I am going to be a doctor,apparently it does not follow that it is absolutely necessary that Ishould be an imbecile. I recommend you to moderation in your desires. Itis true that my name is Félix Tholomyès; I speak well. Happy is he who,when the hour strikes, takes a heroic resolve, and abdicates like Sylla orOrigenes.&rdquo;</p><p>Favourite listened with profound attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Félix,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what a pretty word!

Do you wish never to feelthe prick, to do without the nuptial bed, and to brave love? Nothing moresimple.

Long live thatTzar who was great, and long live his boot, which was still greater!Ladies, take the advice of a friend; make a mistake in your neighbor ifyou see fit. The property of love is to err. A love affair is not made tocrouch down and brutalize itself like an English serving-maid who hascallouses on her knees from scrubbing. It is not made for that; it errsgayly, our gentle love. It has been said, error is human; I say, error islove. Ladies, I idolize you all. O Zéphine, O Joséphine, face more thanirregular, you would be charming were you not all askew. You have the airof a pretty face upon which some one has sat down by mistake. As forFavourite, O nymphs and muses! one day when Blachevelle was crossing thegutter in the Rue Guérin-Boisseau, he espied a beautiful girl with whitestockings well drawn up, which displayed her legs. This prologue pleasedhim, and Blachevelle fell in love. The one he loved was Favourite. OFavourite, thou hast Ionian lips. There was a Greek painter namedEuphorion, who was surnamed the painter of the lips. That Greek alonewould have been worthy to paint thy mouth. Listen! before thee, there wasnever a creature worthy of the name. Thou wert made to receive the applelike Venus, or to eat it like Eve; beauty begins with thee. I have justreferred to Eve; it is thou who hast created her. Thou deservest theletters-patent of the beautiful woman. O Favourite, I cease to address youas &lsquo;thou,&rsquo; because I pass from poetry to prose. You were speaking of myname a little while ago. That touched me; but let us, whoever we may be,distrust names. They may delude us. I am called Félix, and I am not happy.Words are liars. Let us not blindly accept the indications which theyafford us. It would be a mistake to write to Liège <a href="#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2" id="linknoteref-2">2</a> for corks, and to Pau forgloves. Miss Dahlia, were I in your place, I would call myself Rosa. Aflower should smell sweet, and woman should have wit. I say nothing ofFantine; she is a dreamer, a musing, thoughtful, pensive person; she is aphantom possessed of the form of a nymph and the modesty of a nun, who hasstrayed into the life of a grisette, but who takes refuge in illusions,and who sings and prays and gazes into the azure without very well knowingwhat she sees or what she is doing, and who, with her eyes fixed onheaven, wanders in a garden where there are more birds than are inexistence. O Fantine, know this: I, Tholomyès, I am an illusion; but shedoes not even hear me, that blond maid of Chimeras! as for the rest,everything about her is freshness, suavity, youth, sweet morning light. OFantine, maid worthy of being called Marguerite or Pearl, you are a womanfrom the beauteous Orient. Ladies, a second piece of advice: do not marry;marriage is a graft; it takes well or ill; avoid that risk. But bah! whatam I saying? I am wasting my words. Girls are incurable on the subject ofmarriage, and all that we wise men can say will not prevent thewaistcoat-makers and the shoe-stitchers from dreaming of husbands studdedwith diamonds. Well, so be it; but, my beauties, remember this, you eattoo much sugar. You have but one fault, O woman, and that is nibblingsugar. O nibbling sex, your pretty little white teeth adore sugar. Now,heed me well, sugar is a salt. All salts are withering. Sugar is the mostdesiccating of all salts; it sucks the liquids of the blood through theveins; hence the coagulation, and then the solidification of the blood;hence tubercles in the lungs, hence death. That is why diabetes borders onconsumption. Then, do not crunch sugar, and you will live. I turn to themen: gentlemen, make conquest, rob each other of your well-beloved withoutremorse. Chassez across. In love there are no friends. Everywhere wherethere is a pretty woman hostility is open. No quarter, war to the death! apretty woman is a <i>casus belli</i>; a pretty woman is flagrantmisdemeanor. All the invasions of history have been determined bypetticoats. Woman is man&rsquo;s right.

The handles are of silver at Bombarda&rsquo;s and of boneat Édon&rsquo;s. Now, silver is more valuable than bone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Except for those who have a silver chin,&rdquo; observed Tholomyès.</p><p>He was looking at the dome of the Invalides, which was visible fromBombarda&rsquo;s windows.</p><p>A pause ensued.</p><p>&ldquo;Tholomyès,&rdquo; exclaimed Fameuil, &ldquo;Listolier and I were having a discussionjust now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A discussion is a good thing,&rdquo; replied Tholomyès; &ldquo;a quarrel is better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We were disputing about philosophy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which do you prefer, Descartes or Spinoza?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Désaugiers,&rdquo; said Tholomyès.</p><p>This decree pronounced, he took a drink, and went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I consent to live. All is not at an end on earth since we can still talknonsense. For that I return thanks to the immortal gods. We lie. One lies,but one laughs. One affirms, but one doubts. The unexpected bursts forthfrom the syllogism. That is fine. There are still human beings here belowwho know how to open and close the surprise box of the paradox merrily.This, ladies, which you are drinking with so tranquil an air is Madeirawine, you must know, from the vineyard of Coural das Freiras, which isthree hundred and seventeen fathoms above the level of the sea.

He would equal Munophis of Elephanta if he could butget me an Indian dancing-girl, and Thygelion of Chæronea if he could bringme a Greek courtesan; for, oh, ladies! there were Bombardas in Greece andin Egypt. Apuleius tells us of them. Alas! always the same, and nothingnew; nothing more unpublished by the creator in creation! <i>Nil sub solenovum</i>, says Solomon; <i>amor omnibus idem</i>, says Virgil; andCarabine mounts with Carabin into the bark at Saint-Cloud, as Aspasiaembarked with Pericles upon the fleet at Samos. One last word. Do you knowwhat Aspasia was, ladies? Although she lived at an epoch when women had,as yet, no soul, she was a soul; a soul of a rosy and purple hue, moreardent hued than fire, fresher than the dawn. Aspasia was a creature inwhom two extremes of womanhood met; she was the goddess prostitute;Socrates plus Manon Lescaut. Aspasia was created in case a mistress shouldbe needed for Prometheus.&rdquo;</p><p>Tholomyès, once started, would have found some difficulty in stopping, hadnot a horse fallen down upon the quay just at that moment. The shockcaused the cart and the orator to come to a dead halt. It was a Beauceronmare, old and thin, and one fit for the knacker, which was dragging a veryheavy cart. On arriving in front of Bombarda&rsquo;s, the worn-out, exhaustedbeast had refused to proceed any further. This incident attracted a crowd.Hardly had the cursing and indignant carter had time to utter with properenergy the sacramental word, <i>Mâtin</i> (the jade), backed up with apitiless cut of the whip, when the jade fell, never to rise again. Onhearing the hubbub made by the passers-by, Tholomyès&rsquo; merry auditorsturned their heads, and Tholomyès took advantage of the opportunity tobring his allocution to a close with this melancholy strophe:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Elle était de ce monde ou coucous et carrosses<br />    Ont le même destin;<br />Et, rosse, elle a vécu ce que vivant les rosses,<br />    L&rsquo;espace d&rsquo;un mâtin!&rdquo; <a href="#linknote-3"name="linknoteref-3" id="linknoteref-3">3</a></p><p>&ldquo;Poor horse!&rdquo; sighed Fantine.</p><p>And Dahlia exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There is Fantine on the point of crying over horses.

Thelatter turned round, made signs to them, smiled, and disappeared in thatdusty Sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into the Champs-Élysées.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be long!&rdquo; cried Fantine.</p><p>&ldquo;What are they going to bring us?&rdquo; said Zéphine.</p><p>&ldquo;It will certainly be something pretty,&rdquo; said Dahlia.</p><p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said Favourite, &ldquo;I want it to be of gold.&rdquo;</p><p>Their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of thelake, which they could see through the branches of the large trees, andwhich diverted them greatly.</p><p>It was the hour for the departure of the mail-coaches and diligences.Nearly all the stage-coaches for the south and west passed through theChamps-Élysées. The majority followed the quay and went through the PassyBarrier. From moment to moment, some huge vehicle, painted yellow andblack, heavily loaded, noisily harnessed, rendered shapeless by trunks,tarpaulins, and valises, full of heads which immediately disappeared,rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge, with dust forsmoke, and an air of fury, grinding the pavements, changing all thepaving-stones into steels. This uproar delighted the young girls.Favourite exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What a row! One would say that it was a pile of chains flying away.&rdquo;</p><p>It chanced that one of these vehicles, which they could only see withdifficulty through the thick elms, halted for a moment, then set out againat a gallop. This surprised Fantine.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I thought the diligence never stopped.&rdquo;</p><p>Favourite shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;This Fantine is surprising. I am coming to take a look at her out ofcuriosity. She is dazzled by the simplest things. Suppose a case: I am atraveller; I say to the diligence, &lsquo;I will go on in advance; you shallpick me up on the quay as you pass.&rsquo; The diligence passes, sees me, halts,and takes me. That is done every day. You do not know life, my dear.&rdquo;</p><p>In this manner a certain time elapsed.

This cook-shop waskept by some people named Thénardier, husband and wife. It was situated inBoulanger Lane. Over the door there was a board nailed flat against thewall. Upon this board was painted something which resembled a man carryinganother man on his back, the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of ageneral, with large silver stars; red spots represented blood; the rest ofthe picture consisted of smoke, and probably represented a battle. Belowran this inscription: AT THE SIGN OF SERGEANT OF WATERLOO (<i>Au Sargentde Waterloo</i>).</p><p>Nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry.Nevertheless, the vehicle, or, to speak more accurately, the fragment of avehicle, which encumbered the street in front of the cook-shop of the <i>Sergeantof Waterloo</i>, one evening in the spring of 1818, would certainly haveattracted, by its mass, the attention of any painter who had passed thatway.</p><p>It was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used in woodedtracts of country, and which serve to transport thick planks and thetrunks of trees. This fore-carriage was composed of a massive ironaxle-tree with a pivot, into which was fitted a heavy shaft, and which wassupported by two huge wheels. The whole thing was compact, overwhelming,and misshapen. It seemed like the gun-carriage of an enormous cannon. Theruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels, the fellies, the hub, theaxle, and the shaft, a layer of mud, a hideous yellowish daubing hue,tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals.The wood was disappearing under mud, and the iron beneath rust. Under theaxle-tree hung, like drapery, a huge chain, worthy of some Goliath of aconvict. This chain suggested, not the beams, which it was its office totransport, but the mastodons and mammoths which it might have served toharness; it had the air of the galleys, but of cyclopean and superhumangalleys, and it seemed to have been detached from some monster. Homerwould have bound Polyphemus with it, and Shakespeare, Caliban.</p><p>Why was that fore-carriage of a truck in that place in the street? In thefirst place, to encumber the street; next, in order that it might finishthe process of rusting. There is a throng of institutions in the oldsocial order, which one comes across in this fashion as one walks aboutoutdoors, and which have no other reasons for existence than the above.</p><p>The centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle, and inthe loop, as in the rope of a swing, there were seated and grouped, onthat particular evening, in exquisite interlacement, two little girls; oneabout two years and a half old, the other, eighteen months; the younger inthe arms of the other. A handkerchief, cleverly knotted about them,prevented their falling out. A mother had caught sight of that frightfulchain, and had said, &ldquo;Come! there&rsquo;s a plaything for my children.&rdquo;</p><p>The two children, who were dressed prettily and with some elegance, wereradiant with pleasure; one would have said that they were two roses amidold iron; their eyes were a triumph; their fresh cheeks were full oflaughter. One had chestnut hair; the other, brown. Their innocent faceswere two delighted surprises; a blossoming shrub which grew near wafted tothe passers-by perfumes which seemed to emanate from them; the child ofeighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the chasteindecency of childhood. Above and around these two delicate heads, allmade of happiness and steeped in light, the gigantic fore-carriage, blackwith rust, almost terrible, all entangled in curves and wild angles, rosein a vault, like the entrance of a cavern. A few paces apart, crouchingdown upon the threshold of the hostelry, the mother, not a veryprepossessing woman, by the way, though touching at that moment, wasswinging the two children by means of a long cord, watching themcarefully, for fear of accidents, with that animal and celestialexpression which is peculiar to maternity. At every backward and forwardswing the hideous links emitted a strident sound, which resembled a cry ofrage; the little girls were in ecstasies; the setting sun mingled in thisjoy, and nothing could be more charming than this caprice of chance whichhad made of a chain of Titans the swing of cherubim.</p><p>As she rocked her little ones, the mother hummed in a discordant voice aromance then celebrated:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;It must be, said a warrior.&rdquo;</p><p>Her song, and the contemplation of her daughters, prevented her hearingand seeing what was going on in the street.</p><p>In the meantime, some one had approached her, as she was beginning thefirst couplet of the romance, and suddenly she heard a voice saying verynear her ear:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You have two beautiful children there, Madame.&rdquo;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;To the fair and tender Imogene&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p class="noindent">replied the mother, continuing her romance; then she turned her head.</p><p>A woman stood before her, a few paces distant. This woman also had achild, which she carried in her arms.</p><p>She was carrying, in addition, a large carpet-bag, which seemed veryheavy.</p><p>This woman&rsquo;s child was one of the most divine creatures that it ispossible to behold. It was a girl, two or three years of age. She couldhave entered into competition with the two other little ones, so far asthe coquetry of her dress was concerned; she wore a cap of fine linen,ribbons on her bodice, and Valenciennes lace on her cap. The folds of herskirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white, firm, and dimpledleg. She was admirably rosy and healthy. The little beauty inspired adesire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks. Of her eyes nothingcould be known, except that they must be very large, and that they hadmagnificent lashes. She was asleep.</p><p>She slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age.The arms of mothers are made of tenderness; in them children sleepprofoundly.</p><p>As for the mother, her appearance was sad and poverty-stricken. She wasdressed like a working-woman who is inclined to turn into a peasant again.She was young. Was she handsome? Perhaps; but in that attire it was notapparent. Her hair, a golden lock of which had escaped, seemed very thick,but was severely concealed beneath an ugly, tight, close, nun-like cap,tied under the chin. A smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them;but she did not smile. Her eyes did not seem to have been dry for a verylong time. She was pale; she had a very weary and rather sicklyappearance. She gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the airpeculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child. A large bluehandkerchief, such as the Invalides use, was folded into a fichu, andconcealed her figure clumsily. Her hands were sunburnt and all dotted withfreckles, her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle; shewore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff, a linen gown, and coarseshoes. It was Fantine.</p><p>It was Fantine, but difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, on scrutinizingher attentively, it was evident that she still retained her beauty. Amelancholy fold, which resembled the beginning of irony, wrinkled herright cheek. As for her toilette, that aerial toilette of muslin andribbons, which seemed made of mirth, of folly, and of music, full ofbells, and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful anddazzling hoar-frost which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight; itmelts and leaves the branch quite black.</p><p>Ten months had elapsed since the &ldquo;pretty farce.&rdquo;</p><p>What had taken place during those ten months? It can be divined.</p><p>After abandonment, straightened circumstances. Fantine had immediatelylost sight of Favourite, Zéphine and Dahlia; the bond once broken on theside of the men, it was loosed between the women; they would have beengreatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later, that they hadbeen friends; there no longer existed any reason for such a thing. Fantinehad remained alone. The father of her child gone,&mdash;alas! suchruptures are irrevocable,&mdash;she found herself absolutely isolated,minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure. Drawn away by her<i>liaison</i> with Tholomyès to disdain the pretty trade which she knew,she had neglected to keep her market open; it was now closed to her. Shehad no resource. Fantine barely knew how to read, and did not know how towrite; in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name; she hada public letter-writer indite an epistle to Tholomyès, then a second, thena third. Tholomyès replied to none of them. Fantine heard the gossips say,as they looked at her child: &ldquo;Who takes those children seriously! One onlyshrugs one&rsquo;s shoulders over such children!&rdquo; Then she thought of Tholomyès,who had shrugged his shoulders over his child, and who did not take thatinnocent being seriously; and her heart grew gloomy toward that man. Butwhat was she to do? She no longer knew to whom to apply. She had committeda fault, but the foundation of her nature, as will be remembered, wasmodesty and virtue. She was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge offalling into distress, and of gliding into a worse state. Courage wasnecessary; she possessed it, and held herself firm. The idea of returningto her native town of M. sur M. occurred to her. There, some one mightpossibly know her and give her work; yes, but it would be necessary toconceal her fault. In a confused way she perceived the necessity of aseparation which would be more painful than the first one. Her heartcontracted, but she took her resolution. Fantine, as we shall see, had thefierce bravery of life. She had already valiantly renounced finery, haddressed herself in linen, and had put all her silks, all her ornaments,all her ribbons, and all her laces on her daughter, the only vanity whichwas left to her, and a holy one it was. She sold all that she had, whichproduced for her two hundred francs; her little debts paid, she had onlyabout eighty francs left. At the age of twenty-two, on a beautiful springmorning, she quitted Paris, bearing her child on her back. Any one who hadseen these two pass would have had pity on them. This woman had, in allthe world, nothing but her child, and the child had, in all the world, noone but this woman. Fantine had nursed her child, and this had tired herchest, and she coughed a little.</p><p>We shall have no further occasion to speak of M. Félix Tholomyès. Let usconfine ourselves to saying, that, twenty years later, under King LouisPhilippe, he was a great provincial lawyer, wealthy and influential, awise elector, and a very severe juryman; he was still a man of pleasure.</p><p>Towards the middle of the day, after having, from time to time, for thesake of resting herself, travelled, for three or four sous a league, inwhat was then known as the <i>Petites Voitures des Environs de Paris</i>,the &ldquo;little suburban coach service,&rdquo; Fantine found herself at Montfermeil,in the alley Boulanger.</p><p>As she passed the Thénardier hostelry, the two little girls, blissful inthe monster swing, had dazzled her in a manner, and she had halted infront of that vision of joy.</p><p>Charms exist. These two little girls were a charm to this mother.</p><p>She gazed at them in much emotion. The presence of angels is anannouncement of Paradise. She thought that, above this inn, she beheld themysterious HERE of Providence. These two little creatures were evidentlyhappy. She gazed at them, she admired them, in such emotion that at themoment when their mother was recovering her breath between two couplets ofher song, she could not refrain from addressing to her the remark which wehave just read:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You have two pretty children, Madame.&rdquo;</p><p>The most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on theiryoung.</p><p>The mother raised her head and thanked her, and bade the wayfarer sit downon the bench at the door, she herself being seated on the threshold. Thetwo women began to chat.</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Madame Thénardier,&rdquo; said the mother of the two little girls.&ldquo;We keep this inn.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, her mind still running on her romance, she resumed humming betweenher teeth:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;It must be so; I am a knight,<br/>And I am off to Palestine.&rdquo;</p><p>This Madame Thénardier was a sandy-complexioned woman, thin and angular&mdash;thetype of the soldier&rsquo;s wife in all its unpleasantness; and what was odd,with a languishing air, which she owed to her perusal of romances. She wasa simpering, but masculine creature. Old romances produce that effect whenrubbed against the imagination of cook-shop woman. She was still young;she was barely thirty. If this crouching woman had stood upright, herlofty stature and her frame of a perambulating colossus suitable forfairs, might have frightened the traveller at the outset, troubled herconfidence, and disturbed what caused what we have to relate to vanish. Aperson who is seated instead of standing erect&mdash;destinies hang uponsuch a thing as that.</p><p>The traveller told her story, with slight modifications.</p><p>That she was a working-woman; that her husband was dead; that her work inParis had failed her, and that she was on her way to seek it elsewhere, inher own native parts; that she had left Paris that morning on foot; that,as she was carrying her child, and felt fatigued, she had got into theVillemomble coach when she met it; that from Villemomble she had come toMontfermeil on foot; that the little one had walked a little, but notmuch, because she was so young, and that she had been obliged to take herup, and the jewel had fallen asleep.</p><p>At this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss, which wokeher. The child opened her eyes, great blue eyes like her mother&rsquo;s, andlooked at&mdash;what? Nothing; with that serious and sometimes severe airof little children, which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in thepresence of our twilight of virtue. One would say that they feelthemselves to be angels, and that they know us to be men. Then the childbegan to laugh; and although the mother held fast to her, she slipped tothe ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished torun. All at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing, stoppedshort, and put out her tongue, in sign of admiration.</p><p>Mother Thénardier released her daughters, made them descend from theswing, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Now amuse yourselves, all three of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Children become acquainted quickly at that age, and at the expiration of aminute the little Thénardiers were playing with the newcomer at makingholes in the ground, which was an immense pleasure.</p><p>The newcomer was very gay; the goodness of the mother is written in thegayety of the child; she had seized a scrap of wood which served her for ashovel, and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly. Thegrave-digger&rsquo;s business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by achild.</p><p>The two women pursued their chat.</p><p>&ldquo;What is your little one&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette.&rdquo;</p><p>For Cosette, read Euphrasie. The child&rsquo;s name was Euphrasie. But out ofEuphrasie the mother had made Cosette by that sweet and graceful instinctof mothers and of the populace which changes Josepha into Pepita, andFrançoise into Sillette. It is a sort of derivative which disarranges anddisconcerts the whole science of etymologists. We have known a grandmotherwho succeeded in turning Theodore into Gnon.</p><p>&ldquo;How old is she?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is going on three.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the age of my eldest.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, the three little girls were grouped in an attitude ofprofound anxiety and blissfulness; an event had happened; a big worm hademerged from the ground, and they were afraid; and they were in ecstasiesover it.</p><p>Their radiant brows touched each other; one would have said that therewere three heads in one aureole.</p><p>&ldquo;How easily children get acquainted at once!&rdquo; exclaimed Mother Thénardier;&ldquo;one would swear that they were three sisters!&rdquo;</p><p>This remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been waitingfor. She seized the Thénardier&rsquo;s hand, looked at her fixedly, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you keep my child for me?&rdquo;</p><p>The Thénardier made one of those movements of surprise which signifyneither assent nor refusal.</p><p>Cosette&rsquo;s mother continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You see, I cannot take my daughter to the country. My work will notpermit it. With a child one can find no situation. People are ridiculousin the country. It was the good God who caused me to pass your inn. When Icaught sight of your little ones, so pretty, so clean, and so happy, itoverwhelmed me. I said: &lsquo;Here is a good mother. That is just the thing;that will make three sisters.&rsquo; And then, it will not be long before Ireturn. Will you keep my child for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I must see about it,&rdquo; replied the Thénardier.</p><p>&ldquo;I will give you six francs a month.&rdquo;</p><p>Here a man&rsquo;s voice called from the depths of the cook-shop:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Not for less than seven francs. And six months paid in advance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Six times seven makes forty-two,&rdquo; said the Thénardier.</p><p>&ldquo;I will give it,&rdquo; said the mother.</p><p>&ldquo;And fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses,&rdquo; added the man&rsquo;svoice.</p><p>&ldquo;Total, fifty-seven francs,&rdquo; said Madame Thénardier. And she hummedvaguely, with these figures:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;It must be, said a warrior.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will pay it,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;I have eighty francs. I shall haveenough left to reach the country, by travelling on foot. I shall earnmoney there, and as soon as I have a little I will return for my darling.&rdquo;</p><p>The man&rsquo;s voice resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The little one has an outfit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is my husband,&rdquo; said the Thénardier.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course she has an outfit, the poor treasure.&mdash;I understoodperfectly that it was your husband.&mdash;And a beautiful outfit, too! asenseless outfit, everything by the dozen, and silk gowns like a lady. Itis here, in my carpet-bag.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must hand it over,&rdquo; struck in the man&rsquo;s voice again.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course I shall give it to you,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;It would be veryqueer if I were to leave my daughter quite naked!&rdquo;</p><p>The master&rsquo;s face appeared.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>The bargain was concluded. The mother passed the night at the inn, gave upher money and left her child, fastened her carpet-bag once more, nowreduced in volume by the removal of the outfit, and light henceforth andset out on the following morning, intending to return soon. People arrangesuch departures tranquilly; but they are despairs!</p><p>A neighbor of the Thénardiers met this mother as she was setting out, andcame back with the remark:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough torend your heart.&rdquo;</p><p>When Cosette&rsquo;s mother had taken her departure, the man said to the woman:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That will serve to pay my note for one hundred and ten francs which fallsdue to-morrow; I lacked fifty francs. Do you know that I should have had abailiff and a protest after me? You played the mouse-trap nicely with youryoung ones.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Without suspecting it,&rdquo; said the woman.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0038" id="link2HCH0038"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;FIRST SKETCH OF TWO UNPREPOSSESSING FIGURES</h3><p>The mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen; but the catrejoices even over a lean mouse.</p><p>Who were these Thénardiers?</p><p>Let us say a word or two of them now. We will complete the sketch lateron.</p><p>These beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people whohave been successful, and of intelligent people who have descended in thescale, which is between the class called &ldquo;middle&rdquo; and the classdenominated as &ldquo;inferior,&rdquo; and which combines some of the defects of thesecond with nearly all the vices of the first, without possessing thegenerous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the bourgeois.</p><p>They were of those dwarfed natures which, if a dull fire chances to warmthem up, easily become monstrous. There was in the woman a substratum ofthe brute, and in the man the material for a blackguard. Both weresusceptible, in the highest degree, of the sort of hideous progress whichis accomplished in the direction of evil. There exist crab-like soulswhich are continually retreating towards the darkness, retrograding inlife rather than advancing, employing experience to augment theirdeformity, growing incessantly worse, and becoming more and moreimpregnated with an ever-augmenting blackness. This man and womanpossessed such souls.</p><p>Thénardier, in particular, was troublesome for a physiognomist. One canonly look at some men to distrust them; for one feels that they are darkin both directions. They are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front.There is something of the unknown about them. One can no more answer forwhat they have done than for what they will do. The shadow which they bearin their glance denounces them. From merely hearing them utter a word orseeing them make a gesture, one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets intheir past and of sombre mysteries in their future.</p><p>This Thénardier, if he himself was to be believed, had been a soldier&mdash;asergeant, he said. He had probably been through the campaign of 1815, andhad even conducted himself with tolerable valor, it would seem. We shallsee later on how much truth there was in this. The sign of his hostelrywas in allusion to one of his feats of arms. He had painted it himself;for he knew how to do a little of everything, and badly.</p><p>It was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, after havingbeen <i>Clélie</i>, was no longer anything but <i>Lodoïska</i>, stillnoble, but ever more and more vulgar, having fallen from Mademoiselle deScudéri to Madame Bournon-Malarme, and from Madame de Lafayette to MadameBarthélemy-Hadot, was setting the loving hearts of the portresses of Parisaflame, and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent. Madame Thénardierwas just intelligent enough to read this sort of books. She lived on them.In them she drowned what brains she possessed. This had given her, whenvery young, and even a little later, a sort of pensive attitude towardsher husband, a scamp of a certain depth, a ruffian lettered to the extentof the grammar, coarse and fine at one and the same time, but, so far assentimentalism was concerned, given to the perusal of Pigault-Lebrun, and&ldquo;in what concerns the sex,&rdquo; as he said in his jargon&mdash;a downright,unmitigated lout. His wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than hewas. Later on, when her hair, arranged in a romantically drooping fashion,began to grow gray, when the Megæra began to be developed from the Pamela,the female Thénardier was nothing but a coarse, vicious woman, who haddabbled in stupid romances. Now, one cannot read nonsense with impunity.The result was that her eldest daughter was named Éponine; as for theyounger, the poor little thing came near being called Gulnare; I know notto what diversion, effected by a romance of Ducray-Dumenil, she owed thefact that she merely bore the name of Azelma.</p><p>However, we will remark by the way, everything was not ridiculous andsuperficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding, and which maybe designated as the anarchy of baptismal names. By the side of thisromantic element which we have just indicated there is the social symptom.It is not rare for the neatherd&rsquo;s boy nowadays to bear the name of Arthur,Alfred, or Alphonse, and for the vicomte&mdash;if there are still anyvicomtes&mdash;to be called Thomas, Pierre, or Jacques. This displacement,which places the &ldquo;elegant&rdquo; name on the plebeian and the rustic name on thearistocrat, is nothing else than an eddy of equality. The irresistiblepenetration of the new inspiration is there as everywhere else. Beneaththis apparent discord there is a great and a profound thing,&mdash;theFrench Revolution.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0039" id="link2HCH0039"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE LARK</h3><p>It is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper. Thecook-shop was in a bad way.</p><p>Thanks to the traveller&rsquo;s fifty-seven francs, Thénardier had been able toavoid a protest and to honor his signature. On the following month theywere again in need of money. The woman took Cosette&rsquo;s outfit to Paris, andpawned it at the pawnbroker&rsquo;s for sixty francs. As soon as that sum wasspent, the Thénardiers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merelyas a child whom they were caring for out of charity; and they treated heraccordingly. As she had no longer any clothes, they dressed her in thecast-off petticoats and chemises of the Thénardier brats; that is to say,in rags. They fed her on what all the rest had left&mdash;a little betterthan the dog, a little worse than the cat. Moreover, the cat and the dogwere her habitual table-companions; Cosette ate with them under the table,from a wooden bowl similar to theirs.</p><p>The mother, who had established herself, as we shall see later on, at M.sur M., wrote, or, more correctly, caused to be written, a letter everymonth, that she might have news of her child. The Thénardiers repliedinvariably, &ldquo;Cosette is doing wonderfully well.&rdquo;</p><p>At the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs forthe seventh month, and continued her remittances with tolerable regularityfrom month to month. The year was not completed when Thénardier said: &ldquo;Afine favor she is doing us, in sooth! What does she expect us to do withher seven francs?&rdquo; and he wrote to demand twelve francs. The mother, whomthey had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy, &ldquo;and wascoming on well,&rdquo; submitted, and forwarded the twelve francs.</p><p>Certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the other.Mother Thénardier loved her two daughters passionately, which caused herto hate the stranger.</p><p>It is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainousaspects. Little as was the space occupied by Cosette, it seemed to her asthough it were taken from her own, and that that little child diminishedthe air which her daughters breathed. This woman, like many women of hersort, had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and injuries todispense each day. If she had not had Cosette, it is certain that herdaughters, idolized as they were, would have received the whole of it; butthe stranger did them the service to divert the blows to herself. Herdaughters received nothing but caresses. Cosette could not make a motionwhich did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent blows andunmerited chastisement. The sweet, feeble being, who should not haveunderstood anything of this world or of God, incessantly punished,scolded, ill-used, beaten, and seeing beside her two little creatures likeherself, who lived in a ray of dawn!</p><p>Madame Thénardier was vicious with Cosette. Éponine and Azelma werevicious. Children at that age are only copies of their mother. The size issmaller; that is all.</p><p>A year passed; then another.</p><p>People in the village said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Those Thénardiers are good people. They are not rich, and yet they arebringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands!&rdquo;</p><p>They thought that Cosette&rsquo;s mother had forgotten her.</p><p>In the meanwhile, Thénardier, having learned, it is impossible to say bywhat obscure means, that the child was probably a bastard, and that themother could not acknowledge it, exacted fifteen francs a month, sayingthat &ldquo;the creature&rdquo; was growing and &ldquo;eating,&rdquo; and threatening to send heraway. &ldquo;Let her not bother me,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll fire her brat rightinto the middle of her secrets. I must have an increase.&rdquo; The mother paidthe fifteen francs.</p><p>From year to year the child grew, and so did her wretchedness.</p><p>As long as Cosette was little, she was the scape-goat of the two otherchildren; as soon as she began to develop a little, that is to say, beforeshe was even five years old, she became the servant of the household.</p><p>Five years old! the reader will say; that is not probable. Alas! it istrue. Social suffering begins at all ages. Have we not recently seen thetrial of a man named Dumollard, an orphan turned bandit, who, from the ageof five, as the official documents state, being alone in the world,&ldquo;worked for his living and stole&rdquo;?</p><p>Cosette was made to run on errands, to sweep the rooms, the courtyard, thestreet, to wash the dishes, to even carry burdens. The Thénardiersconsidered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner,since the mother, who was still at M. sur M., had become irregular in herpayments. Some months she was in arrears.</p><p>If this mother had returned to Montfermeil at the end of these threeyears, she would not have recognized her child. Cosette, so pretty androsy on her arrival in that house, was now thin and pale. She had anindescribably uneasy look. &ldquo;The sly creature,&rdquo; said the Thénardiers.</p><p>Injustice had made her peevish, and misery had made her ugly. Nothingremained to her except her beautiful eyes, which inspired pain, because,large as they were, it seemed as though one beheld in them a still largeramount of sadness.</p><p>It was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child, not yet six yearsold, shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen, full of holes,sweeping the street before daylight, with an enormous broom in her tinyred hands, and a tear in her great eyes.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010"></a><img src="images/1b4-1-cossette-sweeping.jpg" alt="Cossette Sweeping" width="100%" /></div><p>She was called the <i>Lark</i> in the neighborhood. The populace, who arefond of these figures of speech, had taken a fancy to bestow this name onthis trembling, frightened, and shivering little creature, no bigger thana bird, who was awake every morning before any one else in the house orthe village, and was always in the street or the fields before daybreak.</p><p>Only the little lark never sang.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0048" id="link2H_4_0048"></a>BOOK FIFTH&mdash;THE DESCENT</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0040" id="link2HCH0040"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE HISTORY OF A PROGRESS IN BLACK GLASS TRINKETS</h3><p>And in the meantime, what had become of that mother who according to thepeople at Montfermeil, seemed to have abandoned her child? Where was she?What was she doing?</p><p>After leaving her little Cosette with the Thénardiers, she had continuedher journey, and had reached M. sur M.</p><p>This, it will be remembered, was in 1818.</p><p>Fantine had quitted her province ten years before. M. sur M. had changedits aspect. While Fantine had been slowly descending from wretchedness towretchedness, her native town had prospered.</p><p>About two years previously one of those industrial facts which are thegrand events of small districts had taken place.</p><p>This detail is important, and we regard it as useful to develop it atlength; we should almost say, to underline it.</p><p>From time immemorial, M. sur M. had had for its special industry theimitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany. Thisindustry had always vegetated, on account of the high price of the rawmaterial, which reacted on the manufacture. At the moment when Fantinereturned to M. sur M., an unheard-of transformation had taken place in theproduction of &ldquo;black goods.&rdquo; Towards the close of 1815 a man, a stranger,had established himself in the town, and had been inspired with the ideaof substituting, in this manufacture, gum-lac for resin, and, forbracelets in particular, slides of sheet-iron simply laid together, forslides of soldered sheet-iron.</p><p>This very small change had effected a revolution.</p><p>This very small change had, in fact, prodigiously reduced the cost of theraw material, which had rendered it possible in the first place, to raisethe price of manufacture, a benefit to the country; in the second place,to improve the workmanship, an advantage to the consumer; in the thirdplace, to sell at a lower price, while trebling the profit, which was abenefit to the manufacturer.</p><p>Thus three results ensued from one idea.</p><p>In less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich,which is good, and had made every one about him rich, which is better. Hewas a stranger in the Department. Of his origin, nothing was known; of thebeginning of his career, very little. It was rumored that he had come totown with very little money, a few hundred francs at the most.</p><p>It was from this slender capital, enlisted in the service of an ingeniousidea, developed by method and thought, that he had drawn his own fortune,and the fortune of the whole countryside.</p><p>On his arrival at M. sur M. he had only the garments, the appearance, andthe language of a workingman.</p><p>It appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into thelittle town of M. sur M., just at nightfall, on a December evening,knapsack on back and thorn club in hand, a large fire had broken out inthe town-hall. This man had rushed into the flames and saved, at the riskof his own life, two children who belonged to the captain of thegendarmerie; this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport.Afterwards they had learned his name. He was called Father Madeleine.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0041" id="link2HCH0041"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;MADELEINE</h3><p>He was a man about fifty years of age, who had a preoccupied air, and whowas good. That was all that could be said about him.</p><p>Thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirablyreconstructed, M. sur M. had become a rather important centre of trade.Spain, which consumes a good deal of black jet, made enormous purchasesthere each year. M. sur M. almost rivalled London and Berlin in thisbranch of commerce. Father Madeleine&rsquo;s profits were such, that at the endof the second year he was able to erect a large factory, in which therewere two vast workrooms, one for the men, and the other for women. Any onewho was hungry could present himself there, and was sure of findingemployment and bread. Father Madeleine required of the men good will, ofthe women pure morals, and of all, probity. He had separated thework-rooms in order to separate the sexes, and so that the women and girlsmight remain discreet. On this point he was inflexible. It was the onlything in which he was in a manner intolerant. He was all the more firmlyset on this severity, since M. sur M., being a garrison town,opportunities for corruption abounded. However, his coming had been aboon, and his presence was a godsend. Before Father Madeleine&rsquo;s arrival,everything had languished in the country; now everything lived with ahealthy life of toil. A strong circulation warmed everything andpenetrated everywhere. Slack seasons and wretchedness were unknown. Therewas no pocket so obscure that it had not a little money in it; no dwellingso lowly that there was not some little joy within it.</p><p>Father Madeleine gave employment to every one. He exacted but one thing:Be an honest man. Be an honest woman.</p><p>As we have said, in the midst of this activity of which he was the causeand the pivot, Father Madeleine made his fortune; but a singular thing ina simple man of business, it did not seem as though that were his chiefcare. He appeared to be thinking much of others, and little of himself. In1820 he was known to have a sum of six hundred and thirty thousand francslodged in his name with Laffitte; but before reserving these six hundredand thirty thousand francs, he had spent more than a million for the townand its poor.</p><p>The hospital was badly endowed; he founded six beds there. M. sur M. isdivided into the upper and the lower town. The lower town, in which helived, had but one school, a miserable hovel, which was falling to ruin:he constructed two, one for girls, the other for boys. He allotted asalary from his own funds to the two instructors, a salary twice as largeas their meagre official salary, and one day he said to some one whoexpressed surprise, &ldquo;The two prime functionaries of the state are thenurse and the schoolmaster.&rdquo; He created at his own expense an infantschool, a thing then almost unknown in France, and a fund for aiding oldand infirm workmen. As his factory was a centre, a new quarter, in whichthere were a good many indigent families, rose rapidly around him; heestablished there a free dispensary.</p><p>At first, when they watched his beginnings, the good souls said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s ajolly fellow who means to get rich.&rdquo; When they saw him enriching thecountry before he enriched himself, the good souls said, &ldquo;He is anambitious man.&rdquo; This seemed all the more probable since the man wasreligious, and even practised his religion to a certain degree, a thingwhich was very favorably viewed at that epoch. He went regularly to lowmass every Sunday. The local deputy, who nosed out all rivalry everywhere,soon began to grow uneasy over this religion. This deputy had been amember of the legislative body of the Empire, and shared the religiousideas of a father of the Oratoire, known under the name of Fouché, Ducd&rsquo;Otrante, whose creature and friend he had been. He indulged in gentleraillery at God with closed doors. But when he beheld the wealthymanufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven o&rsquo;clock, he perceived inhim a possible candidate, and resolved to outdo him; he took a Jesuitconfessor, and went to high mass and to vespers. Ambition was at thattime, in the direct acceptation of the word, a race to the steeple. Thepoor profited by this terror as well as the good God, for the honorabledeputy also founded two beds in the hospital, which made twelve.</p><p>Nevertheless, in 1819 a rumor one morning circulated through the town tothe effect that, on the representations of the prefect and inconsideration of the services rendered by him to the country, FatherMadeleine was to be appointed by the King, mayor of M. sur M. Those whohad pronounced this newcomer to be &ldquo;an ambitious fellow,&rdquo; seized withdelight on this opportunity which all men desire, to exclaim, &ldquo;There! whatdid we say!&rdquo; All M. sur M. was in an uproar. The rumor was well founded.Several days later the appointment appeared in the <i>Moniteur</i>. On thefollowing day Father Madeleine refused.</p><p>In this same year of 1819 the products of the new process invented byMadeleine figured in the industrial exhibition; when the jury made theirreport, the King appointed the inventor a chevalier of the Legion ofHonor. A fresh excitement in the little town. Well, so it was the crossthat he wanted! Father Madeleine refused the cross.</p><p>Decidedly this man was an enigma. The good souls got out of theirpredicament by saying, &ldquo;After all, he is some sort of an adventurer.&rdquo;</p><p>We have seen that the country owed much to him; the poor owed himeverything; he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had beenobliged to honor and respect him. His workmen, in particular, adored him,and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity. When hewas known to be rich, &ldquo;people in society&rdquo; bowed to him, and he receivedinvitations in the town; he was called, in town, Monsieur Madeleine; hisworkmen and the children continued to call him Father Madeleine, and thatwas what was most adapted to make him smile. In proportion as he mounted,throve, invitations rained down upon him. &ldquo;Society&rdquo; claimed him for itsown. The prim little drawing-rooms on M. sur M., which, of course, had atfirst been closed to the artisan, opened both leaves of theirfolding-doors to the millionnaire. They made a thousand advances to him.He refused.</p><p>This time the good gossips had no trouble. &ldquo;He is an ignorant man, of noeducation. No one knows where he came from. He would not know how tobehave in society. It has not been absolutely proved that he knows how toread.&rdquo;</p><p>When they saw him making money, they said, &ldquo;He is a man of business.&rdquo; Whenthey saw him scattering his money about, they said, &ldquo;He is an ambitiousman.&rdquo; When he was seen to decline honors, they said, &ldquo;He is anadventurer.&rdquo; When they saw him repulse society, they said, &ldquo;He is abrute.&rdquo;</p><p>In 1820, five years after his arrival in M. sur M., the services which hehad rendered to the district were so dazzling, the opinion of the wholecountry round about was so unanimous, that the King again appointed himmayor of the town. He again declined; but the prefect resisted hisrefusal, all the notabilities of the place came to implore him, the peoplein the street besought him; the urging was so vigorous that he ended byaccepting. It was noticed that the thing which seemed chiefly to bring himto a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe addressed to him by anold woman of the people, who called to him from her threshold, in an angryway: <i>&ldquo;A good mayor is a useful thing. Is he drawing back before thegood which he can do?&rdquo;</i></p><p>This was the third phase of his ascent. Father Madeleine had becomeMonsieur Madeleine. Monsieur Madeleine became Monsieur le Maire.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0042" id="link2HCH0042"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;SUMS DEPOSITED WITH LAFFITTE</h3><p>On the other hand, he remained as simple as on the first day. He had grayhair, a serious eye, the sunburned complexion of a laborer, the thoughtfulvisage of a philosopher. He habitually wore a hat with a wide brim, and along coat of coarse cloth, buttoned to the chin. He fulfilled his dutiesas mayor; but, with that exception, he lived in solitude. He spoke to butfew people. He avoided polite attentions; he escaped quickly; he smiled torelieve himself of the necessity of talking; he gave, in order to get ridof the necessity for smiling. The women said of him, &ldquo;What a good-naturedbear!&rdquo; His pleasure consisted in strolling in the fields.</p><p>He always took his meals alone, with an open book before him, which heread. He had a well-selected little library. He loved books; books arecold but safe friends. In proportion as leisure came to him with fortune,he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind. It had beenobserved that, ever since his arrival at M. sur M., his language had grownmore polished, more choice, and more gentle with every passing year. Heliked to carry a gun with him on his strolls, but he rarely made use ofit. When he did happen to do so, his shooting was something so infallibleas to inspire terror. He never killed an inoffensive animal. He never shotat a little bird.</p><p>Although he was no longer young, it was thought that he was stillprodigiously strong. He offered his assistance to any one who was in needof it, lifted a horse, released a wheel clogged in the mud, or stopped arunaway bull by the horns. He always had his pockets full of money when hewent out; but they were empty on his return. When he passed through avillage, the ragged brats ran joyously after him, and surrounded him likea swarm of gnats.</p><p>It was thought that he must, in the past, have lived a country life, sincehe knew all sorts of useful secrets, which he taught to the peasants. Hetaught them how to destroy scurf on wheat, by sprinkling it and thegranary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a solution of commonsalt; and how to chase away weevils by hanging up orviot in bloomeverywhere, on the walls and the ceilings, among the grass and in thehouses.</p><p>He had &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; for exterminating from a field, blight, tares, foxtail,and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat. He defended a rabbitwarren against rats, simply by the odor of a guinea-pig which he placed init.</p><p>One day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up nettles;he examined the plants, which were uprooted and already dried, and said:&ldquo;They are dead. Nevertheless, it would be a good thing to know how to makeuse of them. When the nettle is young, the leaf makes an excellentvegetable; when it is older, it has filaments and fibres like hemp andflax. Nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth. Chopped up, nettles are goodfor poultry; pounded, they are good for horned cattle. The seed of thenettle, mixed with fodder, gives gloss to the hair of animals; the root,mixed with salt, produces a beautiful yellow coloring-matter. Moreover, itis an excellent hay, which can be cut twice. And what is required for thenettle? A little soil, no care, no culture. Only the seed falls as it isripe, and it is difficult to collect it. That is all. With the exercise ofa little care, the nettle could be made useful; it is neglected and itbecomes hurtful. It is exterminated. How many men resemble the nettle!&rdquo; Headded, after a pause: &ldquo;Remember this, my friends: there are no such thingsas bad plants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators.&rdquo;</p><p>The children loved him because he knew how to make charming little triflesof straw and cocoanuts.</p><p>When he saw the door of a church hung in black, he entered: he sought outfunerals as other men seek christenings. Widowhood and the grief of othersattracted him, because of his great gentleness; he mingled with thefriends clad in mourning, with families dressed in black, with the priestsgroaning around a coffin. He seemed to like to give to his thoughts fortext these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision of the other world.With his eyes fixed on heaven, he listened with a sort of aspirationtowards all the mysteries of the infinite, those sad voices which sing onthe verge of the obscure abyss of death.</p><p>He performed a multitude of good actions, concealing his agency in them asa man conceals himself because of evil actions. He penetrated housesprivately, at night; he ascended staircases furtively. A poor wretch onreturning to his attic would find that his door had been opened, sometimeseven forced, during his absence. The poor man made a clamor over it: somemalefactor had been there! He entered, and the first thing he beheld was apiece of gold lying forgotten on some piece of furniture. The &ldquo;malefactor&rdquo; who had been there was Father Madeleine.</p><p>He was affable and sad. The people said: &ldquo;There is a rich man who has nota haughty air. There is a happy man who has not a contented air.&rdquo;</p><p>Some people maintained that he was a mysterious person, and that no oneever entered his chamber, which was a regular anchorite&rsquo;s cell, furnishedwith winged hour-glasses and enlivened by cross-bones and skulls of deadmen! This was much talked of, so that one of the elegant and maliciousyoung women of M. sur M. came to him one day, and asked: &ldquo;Monsieur leMaire, pray show us your chamber. It is said to be a grotto.&rdquo; He smiled,and introduced them instantly into this &ldquo;grotto.&rdquo; They were well punishedfor their curiosity. The room was very simply furnished in mahogany, whichwas rather ugly, like all furniture of that sort, and hung with paperworth twelve sous. They could see nothing remarkable about it, except twocandlesticks of antique pattern which stood on the chimney-piece andappeared to be silver, &ldquo;for they were hall-marked,&rdquo; an observation full ofthe type of wit of petty towns.</p><p>Nevertheless, people continued to say that no one ever got into the room,and that it was a hermit&rsquo;s cave, a mysterious retreat, a hole, a tomb.</p><p>It was also whispered about that he had &ldquo;immense&rdquo; sums deposited withLaffitte, with this peculiar feature, that they were always at hisimmediate disposal, so that, it was added, M. Madeleine could make hisappearance at Laffitte&rsquo;s any morning, sign a receipt, and carry off histwo or three millions in ten minutes. In reality, &ldquo;these two or threemillions&rdquo; were reducible, as we have said, to six hundred and thirty orforty thousand francs.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0043" id="link2HCH0043"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;M. MADELEINE IN MOURNING</h3><p>At the beginning of 1820 the newspapers announced the death of M. Myriel,Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;, surnamed &ldquo;Monseigneur Bienvenu,&rdquo; who had diedin the odor of sanctity at the age of eighty-two.</p><p>The Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash; to supply here a detail which the papersomitted&mdash;had been blind for many years before his death, and contentto be blind, as his sister was beside him.</p><p>Let us remark by the way, that to be blind and to be loved, is, in fact,one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth,where nothing is complete. To have continually at one&rsquo;s side a woman, adaughter, a sister, a charming being, who is there because you need herand because she cannot do without you; to know that we are indispensableto a person who is necessary to us; to be able to incessantly measureone&rsquo;s affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows on us, andto say to ourselves, &ldquo;Since she consecrates the whole of her time to me,it is because I possess the whole of her heart&rdquo;; to behold her thought inlieu of her face; to be able to verify the fidelity of one being amid theeclipse of the world; to regard the rustle of a gown as the sound ofwings; to hear her come and go, retire, speak, return, sing, and to thinkthat one is the centre of these steps, of this speech; to manifest at eachinstant one&rsquo;s personal attraction; to feel one&rsquo;s self all the morepowerful because of one&rsquo;s infirmity; to become in one&rsquo;s obscurity, andthrough one&rsquo;s obscurity, the star around which this angel gravitates,&mdash;fewfelicities equal this. The supreme happiness of life consists in theconviction that one is loved; loved for one&rsquo;s own sake&mdash;let us sayrather, loved in spite of one&rsquo;s self; this conviction the blind manpossesses. To be served in distress is to be caressed. Does he lackanything? No. One does not lose the sight when one has love. And whatlove! A love wholly constituted of virtue! There is no blindness wherethere is certainty. Soul seeks soul, gropingly, and finds it. And thissoul, found and tested, is a woman. A hand sustains you; it is hers: amouth lightly touches your brow; it is her mouth: you hear a breath verynear you; it is hers. To have everything of her, from her worship to herpity, never to be left, to have that sweet weakness aiding you, to leanupon that immovable reed, to touch Providence with one&rsquo;s hands, and to beable to take it in one&rsquo;s arms,&mdash;God made tangible,&mdash;what bliss!The heart, that obscure, celestial flower, undergoes a mysteriousblossoming. One would not exchange that shadow for all brightness! Theangel soul is there, uninterruptedly there; if she departs, it is but toreturn again; she vanishes like a dream, and reappears like reality. Onefeels warmth approaching, and behold! she is there. One overflows withserenity, with gayety, with ecstasy; one is a radiance amid the night. Andthere are a thousand little cares. Nothings, which are enormous in thatvoid. The most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lullyou, and supplying the vanished universe to you. One is caressed with thesoul. One sees nothing, but one feels that one is adored. It is a paradiseof shadows.</p><p>It was from this paradise that Monseigneur Welcome had passed to theother.</p><p>The announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of M. surM. On the following day, M. Madeleine appeared clad wholly in black, andwith crape on his hat.</p><p>This mourning was noticed in the town, and commented on. It seemed tothrow a light on M. Madeleine&rsquo;s origin. It was concluded that somerelationship existed between him and the venerable Bishop. <i>&ldquo;He has goneinto mourning for the Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</i> said thedrawing-rooms; this raised M. Madeleine&rsquo;s credit greatly, and procured forhim, instantly and at one blow, a certain consideration in the noble worldof M. sur M. The microscopic Faubourg Saint-Germain of the place meditatedraising the quarantine against M. Madeleine, the probable relative of abishop. M. Madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained, bythe more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentifulsmiles of the young ones. One evening, a ruler in that petty great world,who was curious by right of seniority, ventured to ask him, &ldquo;M. le Maireis doubtless a cousin of the late Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p><p>He said, &ldquo;No, Madame.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; resumed the dowager, &ldquo;you are wearing mourning for him.&rdquo;</p><p>He replied, &ldquo;It is because I was a servant in his family in my youth.&rdquo;</p><p>Another thing which was remarked, was, that every time that he encounteredin the town a young Savoyard who was roaming about the country and seekingchimneys to sweep, the mayor had him summoned, inquired his name, and gavehim money. The little Savoyards told each other about it: a great many ofthem passed that way.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0044" id="link2HCH0044"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;VAGUE FLASHES ON THE HORIZON</h3><p>Little by little, and in the course of time, all this opposition subsided.There had at first been exercised against M. Madeleine, in virtue of asort of law which all those who rise must submit to, blackening andcalumnies; then they grew to be nothing more than ill-nature, then merelymalicious remarks, then even this entirely disappeared; respect becamecomplete, unanimous, cordial, and towards 1821 the moment arrived when theword &ldquo;Monsieur le Maire&rdquo; was pronounced at M. sur M. with almost the sameaccent as &ldquo;Monseigneur the Bishop&rdquo; had been pronounced in D&mdash;&mdash;in 1815. People came from a distance of ten leagues around to consult M.Madeleine. He put an end to differences, he prevented lawsuits, hereconciled enemies. Every one took him for the judge, and with goodreason. It seemed as though he had for a soul the book of the natural law.It was like an epidemic of veneration, which in the course of six or sevenyears gradually took possession of the whole district.</p><p>One single man in the town, in the arrondissement, absolutely escaped thiscontagion, and, whatever Father Madeleine did, remained his opponent asthough a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinct kept him on thealert and uneasy. It seems, in fact, as though there existed in certainmen a veritable bestial instinct, though pure and upright, like allinstincts, which creates antipathies and sympathies, which fatallyseparates one nature from another nature, which does not hesitate, whichfeels no disquiet, which does not hold its peace, and which never beliesitself, clear in its obscurity, infallible, imperious, intractable,stubborn to all counsels of the intelligence and to all the dissolvents ofreason, and which, in whatever manner destinies are arranged, secretlywarns the man-dog of the presence of the man-cat, and the man-fox of thepresence of the man-lion.</p><p>It frequently happened that when M. Madeleine was passing along a street,calm, affectionate, surrounded by the blessings of all, a man of loftystature, clad in an iron-gray frock-coat, armed with a heavy cane, andwearing a battered hat, turned round abruptly behind him, and followed himwith his eyes until he disappeared, with folded arms and a slow shake ofthe head, and his upper lip raised in company with his lower to his nose,a sort of significant grimace which might be translated by: &ldquo;What is thatman, after all? I certainly have seen him somewhere. In any case, I am nothis dupe.&rdquo;</p><p>This person, grave with a gravity which was almost menacing, was one ofthose men who, even when only seen by a rapid glimpse, arrest thespectator&rsquo;s attention.</p><p>His name was Javert, and he belonged to the police.</p><p>At M. sur M. he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of aninspector. He had not seen Madeleine&rsquo;s beginnings. Javert owed the postwhich he occupied to the protection of M. Chabouillet, the secretary ofthe Minister of State, Comte Anglès, then prefect of police at Paris. WhenJavert arrived at M. sur M. the fortune of the great manufacturer wasalready made, and Father Madeleine had become Monsieur Madeleine.</p><p>Certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy, which is complicatedwith an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority. Javert possessedthis physiognomy minus the baseness.</p><p>It is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes, we should beable to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual of thehuman race corresponds to some one of the species of the animal creation;and we could easily recognize this truth, hardly perceived by the thinker,that from the oyster to the eagle, from the pig to the tiger, all animalsexist in man, and that each one of them is in a man. Sometimes evenseveral of them at a time.</p><p>Animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices,straying before our eyes, the visible phantoms of our souls. God showsthem to us in order to induce us to reflect. Only since animals are mereshadows, God has not made them capable of education in the full sense ofthe word; what is the use? On the contrary, our souls being realities andhaving a goal which is appropriate to them, God has bestowed on themintelligence; that is to say, the possibility of education. Socialeducation, when well done, can always draw from a soul, of whatever sortit may be, the utility which it contains.</p><p>This, be it said, is of course from the restricted point of view of theterrestrial life which is apparent, and without prejudging the profoundquestion of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which arenot man. The visible <i>I</i> in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny thelatent <i>I</i>. Having made this reservation, let us pass on.</p><p>Now, if the reader will admit, for a moment, with us, that in every manthere is one of the animal species of creation, it will be easy for us tosay what there was in Police Officer Javert.</p><p>The peasants of Asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolvesthere is one dog, which is killed by the mother because, otherwise, as hegrew up, he would devour the other little ones.</p><p>Give to this dog-son of a wolf a human face, and the result will beJavert.</p><p>Javert had been born in prison, of a fortune-teller, whose husband was inthe galleys. As he grew up, he thought that he was outside the pale ofsociety, and he despaired of ever re-entering it. He observed that societyunpardoningly excludes two classes of men,&mdash;those who attack it andthose who guard it; he had no choice except between these two classes; atthe same time, he was conscious of an indescribable foundation ofrigidity, regularity, and probity, complicated with an inexpressiblehatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung. He entered thepolice; he succeeded there. At forty years of age he was an inspector.</p><p>During his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments of theSouth.</p><p>Before proceeding further, let us come to an understanding as to thewords, &ldquo;human face,&rdquo; which we have just applied to Javert.</p><p>The human face of Javert consisted of a flat nose, with two deep nostrils,towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks. One felt ill atease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns for the firsttime. When Javert laughed,&mdash;and his laugh was rare and terrible,&mdash;histhin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth, but his gums,and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage fold, as on themuzzle of a wild beast. Javert, serious, was a watchdog; when he laughed,he was a tiger. As for the rest, he had very little skull and a great dealof jaw; his hair concealed his forehead and fell over his eyebrows;between his eyes there was a permanent, central frown, like an imprint ofwrath; his gaze was obscure; his mouth pursed up and terrible; his airthat of ferocious command.</p><p>This man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments,comparatively; but he rendered them almost bad, by dint of exaggeratingthem,&mdash;respect for authority, hatred of rebellion; and in his eyes,murder, robbery, all crimes, are only forms of rebellion. He enveloped ina blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the state, fromthe prime minister to the rural policeman. He covered with scorn,aversion, and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal thresholdof evil. He was absolute, and admitted no exceptions. On the one hand, hesaid, &ldquo;The functionary can make no mistake; the magistrate is never thewrong.&rdquo; On the other hand, he said, &ldquo;These men are irremediably lost.Nothing good can come from them.&rdquo; He fully shared the opinion of thoseextreme minds which attribute to human law I know not what power ofmaking, or, if the reader will have it so, of authenticating, demons, andwho place a Styx at the base of society. He was stoical, serious, austere;a melancholy dreamer, humble and haughty, like fanatics. His glance waslike a gimlet, cold and piercing. His whole life hung on these two words:watchfulness and supervision. He had introduced a straight line into whatis the most crooked thing in the world; he possessed the conscience of hisusefulness, the religion of his functions, and he was a spy as other menare priests. Woe to the man who fell into his hands! He would havearrested his own father, if the latter had escaped from the galleys, andwould have denounced his mother, if she had broken her ban. And he wouldhave done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which is conferred byvirtue. And, withal, a life of privation, isolation, abnegation, chastity,with never a diversion. It was implacable duty; the police understood, asthe Spartans understood Sparta, a pitiless lying in wait, a ferocioushonesty, a marble informer, Brutus in Vidocq.</p><p>Javert&rsquo;s whole person was expressive of the man who spies and whowithdraws himself from observation. The mystical school of Joseph deMaistre, which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those thingswhich were called the ultra newspapers, would not have failed to declarethat Javert was a symbol. His brow was not visible; it disappeared beneathhis hat: his eyes were not visible, since they were lost under hiseyebrows: his chin was not visible, for it was plunged in his cravat: hishands were not visible; they were drawn up in his sleeves: and his canewas not visible; he carried it under his coat. But when the occasionpresented itself, there was suddenly seen to emerge from all this shadow,as from an ambuscade, a narrow and angular forehead, a baleful glance, athreatening chin, enormous hands, and a monstrous cudgel.</p><p>In his leisure moments, which were far from frequent, he read, although hehated books; this caused him to be not wholly illiterate. This could berecognized by some emphasis in his speech.</p><p>As we have said, he had no vices. When he was pleased with himself, hepermitted himself a pinch of snuff. Therein lay his connection withhumanity.</p><p>The reader will have no difficulty in understanding that Javert was theterror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the Ministry ofJustice designates under the rubric, Vagrants. The name of Javert routedthem by its mere utterance; the face of Javert petrified them at sight.</p><p>Such was this formidable man.</p><p>Javert was like an eye constantly fixed on M. Madeleine. An eye full ofsuspicion and conjecture. M. Madeleine had finally perceived the fact; butit seemed to be of no importance to him. He did not even put a question toJavert; he neither sought nor avoided him; he bore that embarrassing andalmost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it. He treated Javertwith ease and courtesy, as he did all the rest of the world.</p><p>It was divined, from some words which escaped Javert, that he had secretlyinvestigated, with that curiosity which belongs to the race, and intowhich there enters as much instinct as will, all the anterior traces whichFather Madeleine might have left elsewhere. He seemed to know, and hesometimes said in covert words, that some one had gleaned certaininformation in a certain district about a family which had disappeared.Once he chanced to say, as he was talking to himself, &ldquo;I think I havehim!&rdquo; Then he remained pensive for three days, and uttered not a word. Itseemed that the thread which he thought he held had broken.</p><p>Moreover, and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the too absolutesense which certain words might present, there can be nothing reallyinfallible in a human creature, and the peculiarity of instinct is that itcan become confused, thrown off the track, and defeated. Otherwise, itwould be superior to intelligence, and the beast would be found to beprovided with a better light than man.</p><p>Javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness andtranquillity of M. Madeleine.</p><p>One day, nevertheless, his strange manner appeared to produce animpression on M. Madeleine. It was on the following occasion.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0045" id="link2HCH0045"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;FATHER FAUCHELEVENT</h3><p>One morning M. Madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of M. surM.; he heard a noise, and saw a group some distance away. He approached.An old man named Father Fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart, hishorse having tumbled down.</p><p>This Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had at thattime. When Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood, Fauchelevent, anex-notary and a peasant who was almost educated, had a business which wasbeginning to be in a bad way. Fauchelevent had seen this simple workmangrow rich, while he, a lawyer, was being ruined. This had filled him withjealousy, and he had done all he could, on every occasion, to injureMadeleine. Then bankruptcy had come; and as the old man had nothing leftbut a cart and a horse, and neither family nor children, he had turnedcarter.</p><p>The horse had two broken legs and could not rise. The old man was caughtin the wheels. The fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of thevehicle rested on his breast. The cart was quite heavily laden. FatherFauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner.They had tried, but in vain, to drag him out. An unmethodical effort, aidawkwardly given, a wrong shake, might kill him. It was impossible todisengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him. Javert,who had come up at the moment of the accident, had sent for a jack-screw.</p><p>M. Madeleine arrived. People stood aside respectfully.</p><p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; cried old Fauchelevent. &ldquo;Who will be good and save the old man?&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine turned towards those present:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there a jack-screw to be had?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One has been sent for,&rdquo; answered the peasant.</p><p>&ldquo;How long will it take to get it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They have gone for the nearest, to Flachot&rsquo;s place, where there is afarrier; but it makes no difference; it will take a good quarter of anhour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A quarter of an hour!&rdquo; exclaimed Madeleine.</p><p>It had rained on the preceding night; the soil was soaked.</p><p>The cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment, and crushing theold carter&rsquo;s breast more and more. It was evident that his ribs would bebroken in five minutes more.</p><p>&ldquo;It is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour,&rdquo; said Madeleine tothe peasants, who were staring at him.</p><p>&ldquo;We must!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it will be too late then! Don&rsquo;t you see that the cart is sinking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; resumed Madeleine; &ldquo;there is still room enough under the cart toallow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back. Only half aminute, and the poor man can be taken out. Is there any one here who hasstout loins and heart? There are five louis d&rsquo;or to be earned!&rdquo;</p><p>Not a man in the group stirred.</p><p>&ldquo;Ten louis,&rdquo; said Madeleine.</p><p>The persons present dropped their eyes. One of them muttered: &ldquo;A man wouldneed to be devilish strong. And then he runs the risk of getting crushed!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; began Madeleine again, &ldquo;twenty louis.&rdquo;</p><p>The same silence.</p><p>&ldquo;It is not the will which is lacking,&rdquo; said a voice.</p><p>M. Madeleine turned round, and recognized Javert. He had not noticed himon his arrival.</p><p>Javert went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It is strength. One would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing aslift a cart like that on his back.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, gazing fixedly at M. Madeleine, he went on, emphasizing every wordthat he uttered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Madeleine, I have never known but one man capable of doing whatyou ask.&rdquo;</p><p>Madeleine shuddered.</p><p>Javert added, with an air of indifference, but without removing his eyesfrom Madeleine:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;He was a convict.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Madeleine.</p><p>&ldquo;In the galleys at Toulon.&rdquo;</p><p>Madeleine turned pale.</p><p>Meanwhile, the cart continued to sink slowly. Father Fauchelevent rattledin the throat, and shrieked:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am strangling! My ribs are breaking! a screw! something! Ah!&rdquo;</p><p>Madeleine glanced about him.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there, then, no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the lifeof this poor old man?&rdquo;</p><p>No one stirred. Javert resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw, andhe was that convict.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! It is crushing me!&rdquo; cried the old man.</p><p>Madeleine raised his head, met Javert&rsquo;s falcon eye still fixed upon him,looked at the motionless peasants, and smiled sadly. Then, without sayinga word, he fell on his knees, and before the crowd had even had time toutter a cry, he was underneath the vehicle.</p><p>A terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued.</p><p>They beheld Madeleine, almost flat on his stomach beneath that terribleweight, make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows together.They shouted to him, &ldquo;Father Madeleine, come out!&rdquo; Old Faucheleventhimself said to him, &ldquo;Monsieur Madeleine, go away! You see that I am fatedto die! Leave me! You will get yourself crushed also!&rdquo; Madeleine made noreply.</p><p>All the spectators were panting. The wheels had continued to sink, and ithad become almost impossible for Madeleine to make his way from under thevehicle.</p><p>Suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver, the cart rose slowly, thewheels half emerged from the ruts. They heard a stifled voice crying,&ldquo;Make haste! Help!&rdquo; It was Madeleine, who had just made a final effort.</p><p>They rushed forwards. The devotion of a single man had given force andcourage to all. The cart was raised by twenty arms. Old Fauchelevent wassaved.</p><p>Madeleine rose. He was pale, though dripping with perspiration. Hisclothes were torn and covered with mud. All wept. The old man kissed hisknees and called him the good God. As for him, he bore upon hiscountenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestial suffering,and he fixed his tranquil eye on Javert, who was still staring at him.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0046" id="link2HCH0046"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;FAUCHELEVENT BECOMES A GARDENER IN PARIS</h3><p>Fauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall. Father Madeleine hadhim conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for his workmen inthe factory building itself, and which was served by two sisters ofcharity. On the following morning the old man found a thousand-francbank-note on his night-stand, with these words in Father Madeleine&rsquo;swriting: <i>&ldquo;I purchase your horse and cart.&rdquo;</i> The cart was broken, andthe horse was dead. Fauchelevent recovered, but his knee remained stiff.M. Madeleine, on the recommendation of the sisters of charity and of hispriest, got the good man a place as gardener in a female convent in theRue Saint-Antoine in Paris.</p><p>Some time afterwards, M. Madeleine was appointed mayor. The first timethat Javert beheld M. Madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave himauthority over the town, he felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dogmight experience on smelling a wolf in his master&rsquo;s clothes. From thattime forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could. When therequirements of the service imperatively demanded it, and he could not dootherwise than meet the mayor, he addressed him with profound respect.</p><p>This prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had, besides thevisible signs which we have mentioned, another symptom which was nonethelesssignificant for not being visible. This never deceives. When thepopulation suffers, when work is lacking, when there is no commerce, thetax-payer resists imposts through penury, he exhausts and oversteps hisrespite, and the state expends a great deal of money in the charges forcompelling and collection. When work is abundant, when the country is richand happy, the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing. It may besaid, that there is one infallible thermometer of the public misery andriches,&mdash;the cost of collecting the taxes. In the course of sevenyears the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished three-fourths inthe arrondissement of M. sur M., and this led to this arrondissement beingfrequently cited from all the rest by M. de Villèle, then Minister ofFinance.</p><p>Such was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither. Noone remembered her. Fortunately, the door of M. Madeleine&rsquo;s factory waslike the face of a friend. She presented herself there, and was admittedto the women&rsquo;s workroom. The trade was entirely new to Fantine; she couldnot be very skilful at it, and she therefore earned but little by herday&rsquo;s work; but it was sufficient; the problem was solved; she was earningher living.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0047" id="link2HCH0047"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;MADAME VICTURNIEN EXPENDS THIRTY FRANCS ON MORALITY</h3><p>When Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful for amoment. To live honestly by her own labor, what mercy from heaven! Thetaste for work had really returned to her. She bought a looking-glass,took pleasure in surveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, her fineteeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and of thepossible future, and was almost happy. She hired a little room andfurnished on credit on the strength of her future work&mdash;a lingeringtrace of her improvident ways. As she was not able to say that she wasmarried she took good care, as we have seen, not to mention her littlegirl.</p><p>At first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thénardiers promptly. Asshe only knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write through apublic letter-writer.</p><p>She wrote often, and this was noticed. It began to be said in anundertone, in the women&rsquo;s workroom, that Fantine &ldquo;wrote letters&rdquo; and that&ldquo;she had ways about her.&rdquo;</p><p>There is no one for spying on people&rsquo;s actions like those who are notconcerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall?Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail on Tuesday? Why doeshe always take the narrow streets? Why does Madame always descend from herhackney-coach before reaching her house? Why does she send out to purchasesix sheets of note paper, when she has a &ldquo;whole stationer&rsquo;s shop full ofit?&rdquo; etc. There exist beings who, for the sake of obtaining the key tothese enigmas, which are, moreover, of no consequence whatever to them,spend more money, waste more time, take more trouble, than would berequired for ten good actions, and that gratuitously, for their ownpleasure, without receiving any other payment for their curiosity thancuriosity. They will follow up such and such a man or woman for wholedays; they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of thestreets, under alley-way doors at night, in cold and rain; they will bribeerrand-porters, they will make the drivers of hackney-coaches and lackeystipsy, buy a waiting-maid, suborn a porter. Why? For no reason. A purepassion for seeing, knowing, and penetrating into things. A pure itch fortalking. And often these secrets once known, these mysteries made public,these enigmas illuminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophies,duels, failures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joyof those who have &ldquo;found out everything,&rdquo; without any interest in thematter, and by pure instinct. A sad thing.</p><p>Certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking.Their conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of the anteroom,is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they need a greatamount of combustibles; and their combustibles are furnished by theirneighbors.</p><p>So Fantine was watched.</p><p>In addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her whiteteeth.</p><p>It was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in the midstof the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the moments when she wasthinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she had loved.</p><p>Breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.</p><p>It was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, and that she paidthe carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address: <i>Monsieur,Monsieur Thénardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil</i>. The public writer, agood old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptyinghis pocket of secrets, was made to talk in the wine-shop. In short, it wasdiscovered that Fantine had a child. &ldquo;She must be a pretty sort of awoman.&rdquo; An old gossip was found, who made the trip to Montfermeil, talkedto the Thénardiers, and said on her return: &ldquo;For my five and thirty francsI have freed my mind. I have seen the child.&rdquo;</p><p>The gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, theguardian and door-keeper of every one&rsquo;s virtue. Madame Victurnien wasfifty-six, and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age. Aquavering voice, a whimsical mind. This old dame had once been young&mdash;astonishingfact! In her youth, in &rsquo;93, she had married a monk who had fled from hiscloister in a red cap, and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins.She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp, captious, almost venomous; all this inmemory of her monk, whose widow she was, and who had ruled over hermasterfully and bent her to his will. She was a nettle in which the rustleof the cassock was visible. At the Restoration she had turned bigot, andthat with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk. Shehad a small property, which she bequeathed with much ostentation to areligious community. She was in high favor at the episcopal palace ofArras. So this Madame Victurnien went to Montfermeil, and returned withthe remark, &ldquo;I have seen the child.&rdquo;</p><p>All this took time. Fantine had been at the factory for more than a year,when, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed her fiftyfrancs from the mayor, told her that she was no longer employed in theshop, and requested her, in the mayor&rsquo;s name, to leave the neighborhood.</p><p>This was the very month when the Thénardiers, after having demanded twelvefrancs instead of six, had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve.</p><p>Fantine was overwhelmed. She could not leave the neighborhood; she was indebt for her rent and furniture. Fifty francs was not sufficient to cancelthis debt. She stammered a few supplicating words. The superintendentordered her to leave the shop on the instant. Besides, Fantine was only amoderately good workwoman. Overcome with shame, even more than withdespair, she quitted the shop, and returned to her room. So her fault wasnow known to every one.</p><p>She no longer felt strong enough to say a word. She was advised to see themayor; she did not dare. The mayor had given her fifty francs because hewas good, and had dismissed her because he was just. She bowed before thedecision.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0048" id="link2HCH0048"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;MADAME VICTURNIEN&rsquo;S SUCCESS</h3><p>So the monk&rsquo;s widow was good for something.</p><p>But M. Madeleine had heard nothing of all this. Life is full of just suchcombinations of events. M. Madeleine was in the habit of almost neverentering the women&rsquo;s workroom.</p><p>At the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster, whom thepriest had provided for him, and he had full confidence in thissuperintendent,&mdash;a truly respectable person, firm, equitable,upright, full of the charity which consists in giving, but not having inthe same degree that charity which consists in understanding and inforgiving. M. Madeleine relied wholly on her. The best men are oftenobliged to delegate their authority. It was with this full power, and theconviction that she was doing right, that the superintendent hadinstituted the suit, judged, condemned, and executed Fantine.</p><p>As regards the fifty francs, she had given them from a fund which M.Madeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes, and for givingassistance to the workwomen, and of which she rendered no account.</p><p>Fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood; shewent from house to house. No one would have her. She could not leave town.The second-hand dealer, to whom she was in debt for her furniture&mdash;andwhat furniture!&mdash;said to her, &ldquo;If you leave, I will have you arrestedas a thief.&rdquo; The householder, whom she owed for her rent, said to her,&ldquo;You are young and pretty; you can pay.&rdquo; She divided the fifty francsbetween the landlord and the furniture-dealer, returned to the latterthree-quarters of his goods, kept only necessaries, and found herselfwithout work, without a trade, with nothing but her bed, and still aboutfifty francs in debt.</p><p>She began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison, and earnedtwelve sous a day. Her daughter cost her ten. It was at this point thatshe began to pay the Thénardiers irregularly.</p><p>However, the old woman who lighted her candle for her when she returned atnight, taught her the art of living in misery. Back of living on little,there is the living on nothing. These are the two chambers; the first isdark, the second is black.</p><p>Fantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter; how togive up a bird which eats a half a farthing&rsquo;s worth of millet every twodays; how to make a coverlet of one&rsquo;s petticoat, and a petticoat of one&rsquo;scoverlet; how to save one&rsquo;s candle, by taking one&rsquo;s meals by the light ofthe opposite window. No one knows all that certain feeble creatures, whohave grown old in privation and honesty, can get out of a sou. It ends bybeing a talent. Fantine acquired this sublime talent, and regained alittle courage.</p><p>At this epoch she said to a neighbor, &ldquo;Bah! I say to myself, by onlysleeping five hours, and working all the rest of the time at my sewing, Ishall always manage to nearly earn my bread. And, then, when one is sad,one eats less. Well, sufferings, uneasiness, a little bread on one hand,trouble on the other,&mdash;all this will support me.&rdquo;</p><p>It would have been a great happiness to have her little girl with her inthis distress. She thought of having her come. But what then! Make hershare her own destitution! And then, she was in debt to the Thénardiers!How could she pay them? And the journey! How pay for that?</p><p>The old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called the life ofindigence, was a sainted spinster named Marguerite, who was pious with atrue piety, poor and charitable towards the poor, and even towards therich, knowing how to write just sufficiently to sign herself Marguerite,and believing in God, which is science.</p><p>There are many such virtuous people in this lower world; some day theywill be in the world above. This life has a morrow.</p><p>At first, Fantine had been so ashamed that she had not dared to go out.</p><p>When she was in the street, she divined that people turned round behindher, and pointed at her; every one stared at her and no one greeted her;the cold and bitter scorn of the passers-by penetrated her very flesh andsoul like a north wind.</p><p>It seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath thesarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns. In Paris, at least, noone knows you, and this obscurity is a garment. Oh! how she would haveliked to betake herself to Paris! Impossible!</p><p>She was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute, as she had accustomedherself to indigence. Gradually she decided on her course. At theexpiration of two or three months she shook off her shame, and began to goabout as though there were nothing the matter. &ldquo;It is all the same to me,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>She went and came, bearing her head well up, with a bitter smile, and wasconscious that she was becoming brazen-faced.</p><p>Madame Victurnien sometimes saw her passing, from her window, noticed thedistress of &ldquo;that creature&rdquo; who, &ldquo;thanks to her,&rdquo; had been &ldquo;put back inher proper place,&rdquo; and congratulated herself. The happiness of theevil-minded is black.</p><p>Excess of toil wore out Fantine, and the little dry cough which troubledher increased. She sometimes said to her neighbor, Marguerite, &ldquo;Just feelhow hot my hands are!&rdquo;</p><p>Nevertheless, when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning with anold broken comb, and it flowed about her like floss silk, she experienceda moment of happy coquetry.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0049" id="link2HCH0049"></a>CHAPTER X&mdash;RESULT OF THE SUCCESS</h3><p>She had been dismissed towards the end of the winter; the summer passed,but winter came again. Short days, less work. Winter: no warmth, no light,no noonday, the evening joining on to the morning, fogs, twilight; thewindow is gray; it is impossible to see clearly at it. The sky is but avent-hole. The whole day is a cavern. The sun has the air of a beggar. Afrightful season! Winter changes the water of heaven and the heart of maninto a stone. Her creditors harrassed her.</p><p>Fantine earned too little. Her debts had increased. The Thénardiers, whowere not promptly paid, wrote to her constantly letters whose contentsdrove her to despair, and whose carriage ruined her. One day they wrote toher that her little Cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather, thatshe needed a woollen skirt, and that her mother must send at least tenfrancs for this. She received the letter, and crushed it in her hands allday long. That evening she went into a barber&rsquo;s shop at the corner of thestreet, and pulled out her comb. Her admirable golden hair fell to herknees.</p><p>&ldquo;What splendid hair!&rdquo; exclaimed the barber.</p><p>&ldquo;How much will you give me for it?&rdquo; said she.</p><p>&ldquo;Ten francs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cut it off.&rdquo;</p><p>She purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the Thénardiers. Thispetticoat made the Thénardiers furious. It was the money that they wanted.They gave the petticoat to Éponine. The poor Lark continued to shiver.</p><p>Fantine thought: &ldquo;My child is no longer cold. I have clothed her with myhair.&rdquo; She put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head, and inwhich she was still pretty.</p><p>Dark thoughts held possession of Fantine&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>When she saw that she could no longer dress her hair, she began to hateevery one about her. She had long shared the universal veneration forFather Madeleine; yet, by dint of repeating to herself that it was he whohad discharged her, that he was the cause of her unhappiness, she came tohate him also, and most of all. When she passed the factory in workinghours, when the workpeople were at the door, she affected to laugh andsing.</p><p>An old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashionsaid, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a girl who will come to a bad end.&rdquo;</p><p>She took a lover, the first who offered, a man whom she did not love, outof bravado and with rage in her heart. He was a miserable scamp, a sort ofmendicant musician, a lazy beggar, who beat her, and who abandoned her asshe had taken him, in disgust.</p><p>She adored her child.</p><p>The lower she descended, the darker everything grew about her, the moreradiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart. She said,&ldquo;When I get rich, I will have my Cosette with me;&rdquo; and she laughed. Hercough did not leave her, and she had sweats on her back.</p><p>One day she received from the Thénardiers a letter couched in thefollowing terms: &ldquo;Cosette is ill with a malady which is going the roundsof the neighborhood. A miliary fever, they call it. Expensive drugs arerequired. This is ruining us, and we can no longer pay for them. If you donot send us forty francs before the week is out, the little one will bedead.&rdquo;</p><p>She burst out laughing, and said to her old neighbor: &ldquo;Ah! they are good!Forty francs! the idea! That makes two napoleons! Where do they think I amto get them? These peasants are stupid, truly.&rdquo;</p><p>Nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read theletter once more. Then she descended the stairs and emerged, running andleaping and still laughing.</p><p>Some one met her and said to her, &ldquo;What makes you so gay?&rdquo;</p><p>She replied: &ldquo;A fine piece of stupidity that some country people havewritten to me. They demand forty francs of me. So much for you, youpeasants!&rdquo;</p><p>As she crossed the square, she saw a great many people collected around acarriage of eccentric shape, upon the top of which stood a man dressed inred, who was holding forth. He was a quack dentist on his rounds, who wasoffering to the public full sets of teeth, opiates, powders and elixirs.</p><p>Fantine mingled in the group, and began to laugh with the rest at theharangue, which contained slang for the populace and jargon forrespectable people. The tooth-puller espied the lovely, laughing girl, andsuddenly exclaimed: &ldquo;You have beautiful teeth, you girl there, who arelaughing; if you want to sell me your palettes, I will give you a goldnapoleon apiece for them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are my palettes?&rdquo; asked Fantine.</p><p>&ldquo;The palettes,&rdquo; replied the dental professor, &ldquo;are the front teeth, thetwo upper ones.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How horrible!&rdquo; exclaimed Fantine.</p><p>&ldquo;Two napoleons!&rdquo; grumbled a toothless old woman who was present. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s alucky girl!&rdquo;</p><p>Fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse voiceof the man shouting to her: &ldquo;Reflect, my beauty! two napoleons; they mayprove of service. If your heart bids you, come this evening to the inn ofthe <i>Tillac d&rsquo;Argent</i>; you will find me there.&rdquo;</p><p>Fantine returned home. She was furious, and related the occurrence to hergood neighbor Marguerite: &ldquo;Can you understand such a thing? Is he not anabominable man? How can they allow such people to go about the country!Pull out my two front teeth! Why, I should be horrible! My hair will growagain, but my teeth! Ah! what a monster of a man! I should prefer to throwmyself head first on the pavement from the fifth story! He told me that heshould be at the <i>Tillac d&rsquo;Argent</i> this evening.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what did he offer?&rdquo; asked Marguerite.</p><p>&ldquo;Two napoleons.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That makes forty francs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fantine; &ldquo;that makes forty francs.&rdquo;</p><p>She remained thoughtful, and began her work. At the expiration of aquarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the Thénardiers&rsquo;letter once more on the staircase.</p><p>On her return, she said to Marguerite, who was at work beside her:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What is a miliary fever? Do you know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the old spinster; &ldquo;it is a disease.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does it require many drugs?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! terrible drugs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How does one get it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is a malady that one gets without knowing how.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then it attacks children?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Children in particular.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do people die of it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They may,&rdquo; said Marguerite.</p><p>Fantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on thestaircase.</p><p>That evening she went out, and was seen to turn her steps in the directionof the Rue de Paris, where the inns are situated.</p><p>The next morning, when Marguerite entered Fantine&rsquo;s room before daylight,&mdash;forthey always worked together, and in this manner used only one candle forthe two,&mdash;she found Fantine seated on her bed, pale and frozen. Shehad not lain down. Her cap had fallen on her knees. Her candle had burnedall night, and was almost entirely consumed. Marguerite halted on thethreshold, petrified at this tremendous wastefulness, and exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Lord! the candle is all burned out! Something has happened.&rdquo;</p><p>Then she looked at Fantine, who turned toward her her head bereft of itshair.</p><p>Fantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night.</p><p>&ldquo;Jesus!&rdquo; said Marguerite, &ldquo;what is the matter with you, Fantine?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Fantine. &ldquo;Quite the contrary. My child will not die ofthat frightful malady, for lack of succor. I am content.&rdquo;</p><p>So saying, she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which wereglittering on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Jesus God!&rdquo; cried Marguerite. &ldquo;Why, it is a fortune! Where did youget those louis d&rsquo;or?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I got them,&rdquo; replied Fantine.</p><p>At the same time she smiled. The candle illuminated her countenance. Itwas a bloody smile. A reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips, andshe had a black hole in her mouth.</p><p>The two teeth had been extracted.</p><p>She sent the forty francs to Montfermeil.</p><p>After all it was a ruse of the Thénardiers to obtain money. Cosette wasnot ill.</p><p>Fantine threw her mirror out of the window. She had long since quitted hercell on the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fasten it, nextthe roof; one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle with thefloor, and knocks you on the head every instant. The poor occupant canreach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his destiny, only bybending over more and more.</p><p>She had no longer a bed; a rag which she called her coverlet, a mattresson the floor, and a seatless chair still remained. A little rosebush whichshe had, had dried up, forgotten, in one corner. In the other corner was abutter-pot to hold water, which froze in winter, and in which the variouslevels of the water remained long marked by these circles of ice. She hadlost her shame; she lost her coquetry. A final sign. She went out, withdirty caps. Whether from lack of time or from indifference, she no longermended her linen. As the heels wore out, she dragged her stockings downinto her shoes. This was evident from the perpendicular wrinkles. Shepatched her bodice, which was old and worn out, with scraps of calicowhich tore at the slightest movement. The people to whom she was indebtedmade &ldquo;scenes&rdquo; and gave her no peace. She found them in the street, shefound them again on her staircase. She passed many a night weeping andthinking. Her eyes were very bright, and she felt a steady pain in hershoulder towards the top of the left shoulder-blade. She coughed a greatdeal. She deeply hated Father Madeleine, but made no complaint. She sewedseventeen hours a day; but a contractor for the work of prisons, who madethe prisoners work at a discount, suddenly made prices fall, which reducedthe daily earnings of working-women to nine sous. Seventeen hours of toil,and nine sous a day! Her creditors were more pitiless than ever. Thesecond-hand dealer, who had taken back nearly all his furniture, said toher incessantly, &ldquo;When will you pay me, you hussy?&rdquo; What did they want ofher, good God! She felt that she was being hunted, and something of thewild beast developed in her. About the same time, Thénardier wrote to herthat he had waited with decidedly too much amiability and that he musthave a hundred francs at once; otherwise he would turn little Cosette outof doors, convalescent as she was from her heavy illness, into the coldand the streets, and that she might do what she liked with herself, anddie if she chose. &ldquo;A hundred francs,&rdquo; thought Fantine. &ldquo;But in what tradecan one earn a hundred sous a day?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;let us sell what is left.&rdquo;</p><p>The unfortunate girl became a woman of the town.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0050" id="link2HCH0050"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;CHRISTUS NOS LIBERAVIT</h3><p>What is this history of Fantine? It is society purchasing a slave.</p><p>From whom? From misery.</p><p>From hunger, cold, isolation, destitution. A dolorous bargain. A soul fora morsel of bread. Misery offers; society accepts.</p><p>The sacred law of Jesus Christ governs our civilization, but it does not,as yet, permeate it; it is said that slavery has disappeared from Europeancivilization. This is a mistake. It still exists; but it weighs only uponthe woman, and it is called prostitution.</p><p>It weighs upon the woman, that is to say, upon grace, weakness, beauty,maternity. This is not one of the least of man&rsquo;s disgraces.</p><p>At the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached, nothingis left to Fantine of that which she had formerly been.</p><p>She has become marble in becoming mire. Whoever touches her feels cold.She passes; she endures you; she ignores you; she is the severe anddishonored figure. Life and the social order have said their last word forher. All has happened to her that will happen to her. She has felteverything, borne everything, experienced everything, suffered everything,lost everything, mourned everything. She is resigned, with thatresignation which resembles indifference, as death resembles sleep. She nolonger avoids anything. Let all the clouds fall upon her, and all theocean sweep over her! What matters it to her? She is a sponge that issoaked.</p><p>At least, she believes it to be so; but it is an error to imagine thatfate can be exhausted, and that one has reached the bottom of anythingwhatever.</p><p>Alas!

BAMATABOIS&rsquo;S INACTIVITY</h3><p>There is in all small towns, and there was at M. sur M. in particular, aclass of young men who nibble away an income of fifteen hundred francswith the same air with which their prototypes devour two hundred thousandfrancs a year in Paris. These are beings of the great neuter species:impotent men, parasites, cyphers, who have a little land, a little folly,a little wit; who would be rustics in a drawing-room, and who thinkthemselves gentlemen in the dram-shop; who say, &ldquo;My fields, my peasants,my woods&rdquo;; who hiss actresses at the theatre to prove that they arepersons of taste; quarrel with the officers of the garrison to prove thatthey are men of war; hunt, smoke, yawn, drink, smell of tobacco, playbilliards, stare at travellers as they descend from the diligence, live atthe café, dine at the inn, have a dog which eats the bones under thetable, and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table; who stick at asou, exaggerate the fashions, admire tragedy, despise women, wear outtheir old boots, copy London through Paris, and Paris through the mediumof Pont-à-Mousson, grow old as dullards, never work, serve no use, and dono great harm.</p><p>M. Félix Tholomyès, had he remained in his own province and never beheldParis, would have been one of these men.</p><p>If they were richer, one would say, &ldquo;They are dandies;&rdquo; if they werepoorer, one would say, &ldquo;They are idlers.&rdquo; They are simply men withoutemployment. Among these unemployed there are bores, the bored, dreamers,and some knaves.</p><p>At that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar, a big cravat, awatch with trinkets, three vests of different colors, worn one on top ofthe other&mdash;the red and blue inside; of a short-waisted olive coat,with a codfish tail, a double row of silver buttons set close to eachother and running up to the shoulder; and a pair of trousers of a lightershade of olive, ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite, but alwaysuneven, number of lines, varying from one to eleven&mdash;a limit whichwas never exceeded. Add to this, high shoes with little irons on theheels, a tall hat with a narrow brim, hair worn in a tuft, an enormouscane, and conversation set off by puns of Potier. Over all, spurs and amoustache. At that epoch moustaches indicated the bourgeois, and spurs thepedestrian.</p><p>The provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest ofmoustaches.</p><p>It was the period of the conflict of the republics of South America withthe King of Spain, of Bolivar against Morillo. Narrow-brimmed hats wereroyalist, and were called <i>morillos</i>; liberals wore hats with widebrims, which were called <i>bolivars</i>.</p><p>Eight or ten months, then, after that which is related in the precedingpages, towards the first of January, 1823, on a snowy evening, one ofthese dandies, one of these unemployed, a &ldquo;right thinker,&rdquo; for he wore amorillo, and was, moreover, warmly enveloped in one of those large cloakswhich completed the fashionable costume in cold weather, was amusinghimself by tormenting a creature who was prowling about in a ball-dress,with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair, in front of the officers&rsquo;café. This dandy was smoking, for he was decidedly fashionable.</p><p>Each time that the woman passed in front of him, he bestowed on her,together with a puff from his cigar, some apostrophe which he consideredwitty and mirthful, such as, &ldquo;How ugly you are!&mdash;Will you get out ofmy sight?&mdash;You have no teeth!&rdquo; etc., etc. This gentleman was known asM. Bamatabois. The woman, a melancholy, decorated spectre which went andcame through the snow, made him no reply, did not even glance at him, andnevertheless continued her promenade in silence, and with a sombreregularity, which brought her every five minutes within reach of thissarcasm, like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods. The smalleffect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger; and taking advantageof a moment when her back was turned, he crept up behind her with the gaitof a wolf, and stifling his laugh, bent down, picked up a handful of snowfrom the pavement, and thrust it abruptly into her back, between her bareshoulders. The woman uttered a roar, whirled round, gave a leap like apanther, and hurled herself upon the man, burying her nails in his face,with the most frightful words which could fall from the guard-room intothe gutter. These insults, poured forth in a voice roughened by brandy,did, indeed, proceed in hideous wise from a mouth which lacked its twofront teeth. It was Fantine.</p><p>At the noise thus produced, the officers ran out in throngs from the café,passers-by collected, and a large and merry circle, hooting andapplauding, was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings, whomthere was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman: the manstruggling, his hat on the ground; the woman striking out with feet andfists, bareheaded, howling, minus hair and teeth, livid with wrath,horrible.</p><p>Suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd, seizedthe woman by her satin bodice, which was covered with mud, and said toher, &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;</p><p>The woman raised her head; her furious voice suddenly died away. Her eyeswere glassy; she turned pale instead of livid, and she trembled with aquiver of terror. She had recognized Javert.</p><p>The dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0052" id="link2HCH0052"></a>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;THE SOLUTION OF SOME QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH THEMUNICIPAL POLICE</h3><p>Javert thrust aside the spectators, broke the circle, and set out withlong strides towards the police station, which is situated at theextremity of the square, dragging the wretched woman after him. Sheyielded mechanically. Neither he nor she uttered a word. The cloud ofspectators followed, jesting, in a paroxysm of delight. Supreme misery anoccasion for obscenity.</p><p>On arriving at the police station, which was a low room, warmed by astove, with a glazed and grated door opening on the street, and guarded bya detachment, Javert opened the door, entered with Fantine, and shut thedoor behind him, to the great disappointment of the curious, who raisedthemselves on tiptoe, and craned their necks in front of the thick glassof the station-house, in their effort to see. Curiosity is a sort ofgluttony. To see is to devour.</p><p>On entering, Fantine fell down in a corner, motionless and mute, crouchingdown like a terrified dog.</p><p>The sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table. Javertseated himself, drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket, and beganto write.</p><p>This class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion ofthe police. The latter do what they please, punish them, as seems good tothem, and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which theyentitle their industry and their liberty. Javert was impassive; his graveface betrayed no emotion whatever. Nevertheless, he was seriously anddeeply preoccupied. It was one of those moments when he was exercisingwithout control, but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience,his redoubtable discretionary power. At that moment he was conscious thathis police agent&rsquo;s stool was a tribunal. He was entering judgment. Hejudged and condemned. He summoned all the ideas which could possibly existin his mind, around the great thing which he was doing. The more heexamined the deed of this woman, the more shocked he felt. It was evidentthat he had just witnessed the commission of a crime. He had just beheld,yonder, in the street, society, in the person of a freeholder and anelector, insulted and attacked by a creature who was outside all pales. Aprostitute had made an attempt on the life of a citizen. He had seen that,he, Javert. He wrote in silence.</p><p>When he had finished he signed the paper, folded it, and said to thesergeant of the guard, as he handed it to him, &ldquo;Take three men and conductthis creature to jail.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, turning to Fantine, &ldquo;You are to have six months of it.&rdquo; The unhappywoman shuddered.</p><p>&ldquo;Six months! six months of prison!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Six months in which toearn seven sous a day! But what will become of Cosette? My daughter! mydaughter! But I still owe the Thénardiers over a hundred francs; do youknow that, Monsieur Inspector?&rdquo;</p><p>She dragged herself across the damp floor, among the muddy boots of allthose men, without rising, with clasped hands, and taking great strides onher knees.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Javert,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I beseech your mercy. I assure you that Iwas not in the wrong. If you had seen the beginning, you would have seen.I swear to you by the good God that I was not to blame! That gentleman,the bourgeois, whom I do not know, put snow in my back. Has any one theright to put snow down our backs when we are walking along peaceably, anddoing no harm to any one? I am rather ill, as you see. And then, he hadbeen saying impertinent things to me for a long time: &lsquo;You are ugly! youhave no teeth!&rsquo; I know well that I have no longer those teeth. I didnothing; I said to myself, &lsquo;The gentleman is amusing himself.&rsquo; I washonest with him; I did not speak to him. It was at that moment that he putthe snow down my back. Monsieur Javert, good Monsieur Inspector! is therenot some person here who saw it and can tell you that this is quite true?Perhaps I did wrong to get angry. You know that one is not master of one&rsquo;sself at the first moment. One gives way to vivacity; and then, when someone puts something cold down your back just when you are not expecting it!I did wrong to spoil that gentleman&rsquo;s hat. Why did he go away? I would askhis pardon. Oh, my God! It makes no difference to me whether I ask hispardon. Do me the favor to-day, for this once, Monsieur Javert. Hold! youdo not know that in prison one can earn only seven sous a day; it is notthe government&rsquo;s fault, but seven sous is one&rsquo;s earnings; and just fancy,I must pay one hundred francs, or my little girl will be sent to me. Oh,my God! I cannot have her with me. What I do is so vile! Oh, my Cosette!Oh, my little angel of the Holy Virgin! what will become of her, poorcreature? I will tell you: it is the Thénardiers, inn-keepers, peasants;and such people are unreasonable. They want money. Don&rsquo;t put me in prison!You see, there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street toget along as best she may, in the very heart of the winter; and you musthave pity on such a being, my good Monsieur Javert. If she were older, shemight earn her living; but it cannot be done at that age. I am not a badwoman at bottom. It is not cowardliness and gluttony that have made mewhat I am. If I have drunk brandy, it was out of misery. I do not love it;but it benumbs the senses. When I was happy, it was only necessary toglance into my closets, and it would have been evident that I was not acoquettish and untidy woman. I had linen, a great deal of linen. Have pityon me, Monsieur Javert!&rdquo;</p><p>She spoke thus, rent in twain, shaken with sobs, blinded with tears, herneck bare, wringing her hands, and coughing with a dry, short cough,stammering softly with a voice of agony. Great sorrow is a divine andterrible ray, which transfigures the unhappy. At that moment Fantine hadbecome beautiful once more. From time to time she paused, and tenderlykissed the police agent&rsquo;s coat. She would have softened a heart ofgranite; but a heart of wood cannot be softened.</p><p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Javert, &ldquo;I have heard you out. Have you entirely finished?You will get six months. Now march! The Eternal Father in person could donothing more.&rdquo;</p><p>At these solemn words, <i>&ldquo;the Eternal Father in person could do nothingmore,&rdquo;</i> she understood that her fate was sealed. She sank down,murmuring, &ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo;</p><p>Javert turned his back.</p><p>The soldiers seized her by the arms.</p><p>A few moments earlier a man had entered, but no one had paid any heed tohim. He shut the door, leaned his back against it, and listened toFantine&rsquo;s despairing supplications.</p><p>At the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunatewoman, who would not rise, he emerged from the shadow, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;One moment, if you please.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert raised his eyes and recognized M. Madeleine. He removed his hat,and, saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Mayor&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>The words &ldquo;Mr. Mayor&rdquo; produced a curious effect upon Fantine. She rose toher feet with one bound, like a spectre springing from the earth, thrustaside the soldiers with both arms, walked straight up to M. Madeleinebefore any one could prevent her, and gazing intently at him, with abewildered air, she cried:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! so it is you who are M. le Maire!&rdquo;</p><p>Then she burst into a laugh, and spit in his face.</p><p>M. Madeleine wiped his face, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Inspector Javert, set this woman at liberty.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad. He experienced at thatmoment, blow upon blow and almost simultaneously, the most violentemotions which he had ever undergone in all his life. To see a woman ofthe town spit in the mayor&rsquo;s face was a thing so monstrous that, in hismost daring flights of fancy, he would have regarded it as a sacrilege tobelieve it possible. On the other hand, at the very bottom of his thought,he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was, and as to whatthis mayor might be; and then he, with horror, caught a glimpse of I knownot what simple explanation of this prodigious attack. But when he beheldthat mayor, that magistrate, calmly wipe his face and say, <i>&ldquo;Set thiswoman at liberty,&rdquo;</i> he underwent a sort of intoxication of amazement;thought and word failed him equally; the sum total of possibleastonishment had been exceeded in his case. He remained mute.</p><p>The words had produced no less strange an effect on Fantine. She raisedher bare arm, and clung to the damper of the stove, like a person who isreeling. Nevertheless, she glanced about her, and began to speak in a lowvoice, as though talking to herself:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;At liberty! I am to be allowed to go! I am not to go to prison for sixmonths! Who said that? It is not possible that any one could have saidthat. I did not hear aright. It cannot have been that monster of a mayor!Was it you, my good Monsieur Javert, who said that I was to be set free?Oh, see here! I will tell you about it, and you will let me go. Thatmonster of a mayor, that old blackguard of a mayor, is the cause of all.Just imagine, Monsieur Javert, he turned me out! all because of a pack ofrascally women, who gossip in the workroom. If that is not a horror, whatis? To dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly! Then I could nolonger earn enough, and all this misery followed. In the first place,there is one improvement which these gentlemen of the police ought tomake, and that is, to prevent prison contractors from wronging poorpeople. I will explain it to you, you see: you are earning twelve sous atshirt-making, the price falls to nine sous; and it is not enough to liveon. Then one has to become whatever one can. As for me, I had my littleCosette, and I was actually forced to become a bad woman. Now youunderstand how it is that that blackguard of a mayor caused all themischief. After that I stamped on that gentleman&rsquo;s hat in front of theofficers&rsquo; café; but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow. We women havebut one silk dress for evening wear. You see that I did not do wrongdeliberately&mdash;truly, Monsieur Javert; and everywhere I behold womenwho are far more wicked than I, and who are much happier. O MonsieurJavert! it was you who gave orders that I am to be set free, was it not?Make inquiries, speak to my landlord; I am paying my rent now; they willtell you that I am perfectly honest. Ah! my God! I beg your pardon; I haveunintentionally touched the damper of the stove, and it has made itsmoke.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine listened to her with profound attention. While she wasspeaking, he fumbled in his waistcoat, drew out his purse and opened it.It was empty. He put it back in his pocket. He said to Fantine, &ldquo;How muchdid you say that you owed?&rdquo;</p><p>Fantine, who was looking at Javert only, turned towards him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Was I speaking to you?&rdquo;</p><p>Then, addressing the soldiers:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Say, you fellows, did you see how I spit in his face? Ah! you old wretchof a mayor, you came here to frighten me, but I&rsquo;m not afraid of you. I amafraid of Monsieur Javert. I am afraid of my good Monsieur Javert!&rdquo;</p><p>So saying, she turned to the inspector again:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And yet, you see, Mr. Inspector, it is necessary to be just. I understandthat you are just, Mr. Inspector; in fact, it is perfectly simple: a manamuses himself by putting snow down a woman&rsquo;s back, and that makes theofficers laugh; one must divert themselves in some way; and we&mdash;well,we are here for them to amuse themselves with, of course! And then, you,you come; you are certainly obliged to preserve order, you lead off thewoman who is in the wrong; but on reflection, since you are a good man,you say that I am to be set at liberty; it is for the sake of the littleone, for six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child. &lsquo;Only,don&rsquo;t do it again, you hussy!&rsquo; Oh! I won&rsquo;t do it again, Monsieur Javert!They may do whatever they please to me now; I will not stir. But to-day,you see, I cried because it hurt me. I was not expecting that snow fromthe gentleman at all; and then as I told you, I am not well; I have acough; I seem to have a burning ball in my stomach, and the doctor tellsme, &lsquo;Take care of yourself.&rsquo; Here, feel, give me your hand; don&rsquo;t beafraid&mdash;it is here.&rdquo;</p><p>She no longer wept, her voice was caressing; she placed Javert&rsquo;s coarsehand on her delicate, white throat and looked smilingly at him.</p><p>All at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments, dropped thefolds of her skirt, which had been pushed up as she dragged herself along,almost to the height of her knee, and stepped towards the door, saying tothe soldiers in a low voice, and with a friendly nod:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Children, Monsieur l&rsquo;Inspecteur has said that I am to be released, and Iam going.&rdquo;</p><p>She laid her hand on the latch of the door. One step more and she would bein the street.</p><p>Javert up to that moment had remained erect, motionless, with his eyesfixed on the ground, cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue,which is waiting to be put away somewhere.</p><p>The sound of the latch roused him. He raised his head with an expressionof sovereign authority, an expression all the more alarming in proportionas the authority rests on a low level, ferocious in the wild beast,atrocious in the man of no estate.</p><p>&ldquo;Sergeant!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see that that jade is walking off! Whobade you let her go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Madeleine.</p><p>Fantine trembled at the sound of Javert&rsquo;s voice, and let go of the latchas a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen. At the sound ofMadeleine&rsquo;s voice she turned around, and from that moment forth sheuttered no word, nor dared so much as to breathe freely, but her glancestrayed from Madeleine to Javert, and from Javert to Madeleine in turn,according to which was speaking.</p><p>It was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond measurebefore he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he haddone, after the mayor&rsquo;s suggestion that Fantine should be set at liberty.Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor&rsquo;s presence? Had hefinally declared to himself that it was impossible that any &ldquo;authority&rdquo; should have given such an order, and that the mayor must certainly havesaid one thing by mistake for another, without intending it? Or, in viewof the enormities of which he had been a witness for the past two hours,did he say to himself, that it was necessary to recur to supremeresolutions, that it was indispensable that the small should be madegreat, that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate,that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice, and that, in thisprodigious extremity, order, law, morality, government, society in itsentirety, was personified in him, Javert?</p><p>However that may be, when M. Madeleine uttered that word, <i>I</i>, as wehave just heard, Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward themayor, pale, cold, with blue lips, and a look of despair, his whole bodyagitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence, andsay to him, with downcast eyes but a firm voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Mayor, that cannot be.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said M. Madeleine.</p><p>&ldquo;This miserable woman has insulted a citizen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Inspector Javert,&rdquo; replied the mayor, in a calm and conciliating tone,&ldquo;listen. You are an honest man, and I feel no hesitation in explainingmatters to you. Here is the true state of the case: I was passing throughthe square just as you were leading this woman away; there were stillgroups of people standing about, and I made inquiries and learnedeverything; it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should havebeen arrested by properly conducted police.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert retorted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;This wretch has just insulted Monsieur le Maire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That concerns me,&rdquo; said M. Madeleine. &ldquo;My own insult belongs to me, Ithink. I can do what I please about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I beg Monsieur le Maire&rsquo;s pardon. The insult is not to him but to thelaw.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Inspector Javert,&rdquo; replied M. Madeleine, &ldquo;the highest law is conscience.I have heard this woman; I know what I am doing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I, Mr. Mayor, do not know what I see.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then content yourself with obeying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am obeying my duty. My duty demands that this woman shall serve sixmonths in prison.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine replied gently:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Heed this well; she will not serve a single day.&rdquo;</p><p>At this decisive word, Javert ventured to fix a searching look on themayor and to say, but in a tone of voice that was still profoundlyrespectful:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire; it is for the first time in mylife, but he will permit me to remark that I am within the bounds of myauthority. I confine myself, since Monsieur le Maire desires it, to thequestion of the gentleman. I was present. This woman flung herself onMonsieur Bamatabois, who is an elector and the proprietor of thathandsome house with a balcony, which forms the corner of the esplanade,three stories high and entirely of cut stone. Such things as there are inthe world! In any case, Monsieur le Maire, this is a question of policeregulations in the streets, and concerns me, and I shall detain this womanFantine.&rdquo;</p><p>Then M. Madeleine folded his arms, and said in a severe voice which no onein the town had heard hitherto:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal police.According to the terms of articles nine, eleven, fifteen, and sixty-six ofthe code of criminal examination, I am the judge. I order that this womanshall be set at liberty.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert ventured to make a final effort.</p><p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Mayor&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 13th of December,1799, in regard to arbitrary detention.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Maire, permit me&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not another word.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Leave the room,&rdquo; said M. Madeleine.</p><p>Javert received the blow erect, full in the face, in his breast, like aRussian soldier. He bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left theroom.</p><p>Fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as hepassed.</p><p>Nevertheless, she also was the prey to a strange confusion. She had justseen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers. She hadseen two men who held in their hands her liberty, her life, her soul, herchild, in combat before her very eyes; one of these men was drawing hertowards darkness, the other was leading her back towards the light. Inthis conflict, viewed through the exaggerations of terror, these two menhad appeared to her like two giants; the one spoke like her demon, theother like her good angel. The angel had conquered the demon, and, strangeto say, that which made her shudder from head to foot was the fact thatthis angel, this liberator, was the very man whom she abhorred, that mayorwhom she had so long regarded as the author of all her woes, thatMadeleine! And at the very moment when she had insulted him in so hideousa fashion, he had saved her! Had she, then, been mistaken? Must she changeher whole soul? She did not know; she trembled. She listened inbewilderment, she looked on in affright, and at every word uttered by M.Madeleine she felt the frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt withinher, and something warm and ineffable, indescribable, which was both joy,confidence and love, dawn in her heart.</p><p>When Javert had taken his departure, M. Madeleine turned to her and saidto her in a deliberate voice, like a serious man who does not wish to weepand who finds some difficulty in speaking:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have heard you. I knew nothing about what you have mentioned. I believethat it is true, and I feel that it is true. I was even ignorant of thefact that you had left my shop. Why did you not apply to me? But here; Iwill pay your debts, I will send for your child, or you shall go to her.You shall live here, in Paris, or where you please. I undertake the careof your child and yourself. You shall not work any longer if you do notlike. I will give all the money you require. You shall be honest and happyonce more. And listen! I declare to you that if all is as you say,&mdash;andI do not doubt it,&mdash;you have never ceased to be virtuous and holy inthe sight of God. Oh! poor woman.&rdquo;</p><p>This was more than Fantine could bear. To have Cosette! To leave this lifeof infamy. To live free, rich, happy, respectable with Cosette; to see allthese realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of hermisery. She stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her, and couldonly give vent to two or three sobs, &ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&rdquo;</p><p>Her limbs gave way beneath her, she knelt in front of M. Madeleine, andbefore he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her lipsto it.</p><p>Then she fainted.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0062" id="link2H_4_0062"></a>BOOK SIXTH&mdash;JAVERT</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0053" id="link2HCH0053"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE BEGINNING OF REPOSE</h3><p>M. Madeleine had Fantine removed to that infirmary which he hadestablished in his own house. He confided her to the sisters, who put herto bed. A burning fever had come on. She passed a part of the night indelirium and raving. At length, however, she fell asleep.</p><p>On the morrow, towards midday, Fantine awoke. She heard some one breathingclose to her bed; she drew aside the curtain and saw M. Madeleine standingthere and looking at something over her head. His gaze was full of pity,anguish, and supplication. She followed its direction, and saw that it wasfixed on a crucifix which was nailed to the wall.</p><p>Thenceforth, M. Madeleine was transfigured in Fantine&rsquo;s eyes. He seemed toher to be clothed in light. He was absorbed in a sort of prayer. She gazedat him for a long time without daring to interrupt him. At last she saidtimidly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine had been there for an hour. He had been waiting for Fantineto awake. He took her hand, felt of her pulse, and replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I have slept,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I think that I am better. It isnothing.&rdquo;</p><p>He answered, responding to the first question which she had put to him asthough he had just heard it:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I was praying to the martyr there on high.&rdquo;</p><p>And he added in his own mind, &ldquo;For the martyr here below.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries. Heknew all now. He knew Fantine&rsquo;s history in all its heart-rending details.He went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You have suffered much, poor mother. Oh! do not complain; you now havethe dowry of the elect. It is thus that men are transformed into angels.It is not their fault they do not know how to go to work otherwise. Yousee this hell from which you have just emerged is the first form ofheaven. It was necessary to begin there.&rdquo;</p><p>He sighed deeply. But she smiled on him with that sublime smile in whichtwo teeth were lacking.</p><p>That same night, Javert wrote a letter. The next morning be posted ithimself at the office of M. sur M. It was addressed to Paris, and thesuperscription ran: <i>To Monsieur Chabouillet, Secretary of Monsieur lePréfet of Police</i>. As the affair in the station-house had been bruitedabout, the post-mistress and some other persons who saw the letter beforeit was sent off, and who recognized Javert&rsquo;s handwriting on the cover,thought that he was sending in his resignation.</p><p>M. Madeleine made haste to write to the Thénardiers. Fantine owed them onehundred and twenty francs. He sent them three hundred francs, telling themto pay themselves from that sum, and to fetch the child instantly to M.sur M., where her sick mother required her presence.</p><p>This dazzled Thénardier. &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; said the man to his wife; &ldquo;don&rsquo;tlet&rsquo;s allow the child to go. This lark is going to turn into a milch cow.I see through it. Some ninny has taken a fancy to the mother.&rdquo;</p><p>He replied with a very well drawn-up bill for five hundred and some oddfrancs. In this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over threehundred francs,&mdash;one for the doctor, the other for the apothecary whohad attended and physicked Éponine and Azelma through two long illnesses.Cosette, as we have already said, had not been ill. It was only a questionof a trifling substitution of names. At the foot of the memorandumThénardier wrote, <i>Received on account, three hundred francs</i>.</p><p>M. Madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more, and wrote, &ldquo;Makehaste to bring Cosette.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Christi!&rdquo; said Thénardier, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s not give up the child.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, Fantine did not recover. She still remained in theinfirmary.</p><p>The sisters had at first only received and nursed &ldquo;that woman&rdquo; withrepugnance. Those who have seen the bas-reliefs of Rheims will recall theinflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the foolishvirgins. The ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajæ is one of themost profound instincts of feminine dignity; the sisters felt it with thedouble force contributed by religion. But in a few days Fantine disarmedthem. She said all kinds of humble and gentle things, and the mother inher provoked tenderness. One day the sisters heard her say amid her fever:&ldquo;I have been a sinner; but when I have my child beside me, it will be asign that God has pardoned me. While I was leading a bad life, I shouldnot have liked to have my Cosette with me; I could not have borne her sad,astonished eyes. It was for her sake that I did evil, and that is why Godpardons me. I shall feel the benediction of the good God when Cosette ishere. I shall gaze at her; it will do me good to see that innocentcreature. She knows nothing at all. She is an angel, you see, my sisters.At that age the wings have not fallen off.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine went to see her twice a day, and each time she asked him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Shall I see my Cosette soon?&rdquo;</p><p>He answered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;To-morrow, perhaps. She may arrive at any moment. I am expecting her.&rdquo;</p><p>And the mother&rsquo;s pale face grew radiant.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how happy I am going to be!&rdquo;</p><p>We have just said that she did not recover her health. On the contrary,her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week. That handfulof snow applied to her bare skin between her shoulder-blades had broughtabout a sudden suppression of perspiration, as a consequence of which themalady which had been smouldering within her for many years was violentlydeveloped at last. At that time people were beginning to follow the fineLaënnec&rsquo;s fine suggestions in the study and treatment of chest maladies.The doctor sounded Fantine&rsquo;s chest and shook his head.</p><p>M. Madeleine said to the doctor:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Has she not a child which she desires to see?&rdquo; said the doctor.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well! Make haste and get it here!&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine shuddered.</p><p>Fantine inquired:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What did the doctor say?&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine forced himself to smile.</p><p>&ldquo;He said that your child was to be brought speedily. That that wouldrestore your health.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she rejoined, &ldquo;he is right! But what do those Thénardiers mean bykeeping my Cosette from me! Oh! she is coming. At last I behold happinessclose beside me!&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime Thénardier did not &ldquo;let go of the child,&rdquo; and gave ahundred insufficient reasons for it. Cosette was not quite well enough totake a journey in the winter. And then, there still remained some pettybut pressing debts in the neighborhood, and they were collecting the billsfor them, etc., etc.</p><p>&ldquo;I shall send some one to fetch Cosette!&rdquo; said Father Madeleine. &ldquo;Ifnecessary, I will go myself.&rdquo;</p><p>He wrote the following letter to Fantine&rsquo;s dictation, and made her signit:&mdash;</p><p class="letter">&ldquo;M<small>ONSIEUR</small> T<small>HÉNARDIER</small>:&mdash;<br/>You will deliver Cosette to this person.<br/>You will be paid for all the little things.<br/>I have the honor to salute you with respect.</p><p class="right">&ldquo;F<small>ANTINE</small>.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime a serious incident occurred. Carve as we will themysterious block of which our life is made, the black vein of destinyconstantly reappears in it.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0054" id="link2HCH0054"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;HOW JEAN MAY BECOME CHAMP</h3><p>One morning M. Madeleine was in his study, occupied in arranging inadvance some pressing matters connected with the mayor&rsquo;s office, in casehe should decide to take the trip to Montfermeil, when he was informedthat Police Inspector Javert was desirous of speaking with him. Madeleinecould not refrain from a disagreeable impression on hearing this name.Javert had avoided him more than ever since the affair of thepolice-station, and M. Madeleine had not seen him.</p><p>&ldquo;Admit him,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Javert entered.</p><p>M. Madeleine had retained his seat near the fire, pen in hand, his eyesfixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating, and whichcontained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction ofpolice regulations. He did not disturb himself on Javert&rsquo;s account. Hecould not help thinking of poor Fantine, and it suited him to be glacialin his manner.</p><p>Javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor, whose back was turned tohim. The mayor did not look at him, but went on annotating this docket.</p><p>Javert advanced two or three paces into the study, and halted, withoutbreaking the silence.</p><p>If any physiognomist who had been familiar with Javert, and who had made alengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization, this singularcomposite of the Roman, the Spartan, the monk, and the corporal, this spywho was incapable of a lie, this unspotted police agent&mdash;if anyphysiognomist had known his secret and long-cherished aversion for M.Madeleine, his conflict with the mayor on the subject of Fantine, and hadexamined Javert at that moment, he would have said to himself, &ldquo;What hastaken place?&rdquo; It was evident to any one acquainted with that clear,upright, sincere, honest, austere, and ferocious conscience, that Javerthad but just gone through some great interior struggle. Javert had nothingin his soul which he had not also in his countenance. Like violent peoplein general, he was subject to abrupt changes of opinion. His physiognomyhad never been more peculiar and startling. On entering he bowed to M.Madeleine with a look in which there was neither rancor, anger, nordistrust; he halted a few paces in the rear of the mayor&rsquo;s armchair, andthere he stood, perfectly erect, in an attitude almost of discipline, withthe cold, ingenuous roughness of a man who has never been gentle and whohas always been patient; he waited without uttering a word, without makinga movement, in genuine humility and tranquil resignation, calm, serious,hat in hand, with eyes cast down, and an expression which was half-waybetween that of a soldier in the presence of his officer and a criminal inthe presence of his judge, until it should please the mayor to turn round.All the sentiments as well as all the memories which one might haveattributed to him had disappeared. That face, as impenetrable and simpleas granite, no longer bore any trace of anything but a melancholydepression. His whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and anindescribable courageous despondency.</p><p>At last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round.</p><p>&ldquo;Well! What is it? What is the matter, Javert?&rdquo;</p><p>Javert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas, thenraised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity, which did not, however,preclude simplicity.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the matter, Mr. Mayor; a culpable act has been committed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What act?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;An inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect, and in thegravest manner, towards a magistrate. I have come to bring the fact toyour knowledge, as it is my duty to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is the agent?&rdquo; asked M. Madeleine.</p><p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Javert.</p><p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You, Mr. Mayor.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine sat erect in his armchair. Javert went on, with a severe airand his eyes still cast down.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Mayor, I have come to request you to instigate the authorities todismiss me.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine opened his mouth in amazement. Javert interrupted him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You will say that I might have handed in my resignation, but that doesnot suffice. Handing in one&rsquo;s resignation is honorable. I have failed inmy duty; I ought to be punished; I must be turned out.&rdquo;</p><p>And after a pause he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Mayor, you were severe with me the other day, and unjustly. Be soto-day, with justice.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come, now! Why?&rdquo; exclaimed M. Madeleine. &ldquo;What nonsense is this? What isthe meaning of this? What culpable act have you been guilty of towards me?What have you done to me? What are your wrongs with regard to me? Youaccuse yourself; you wish to be superseded&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Turned out,&rdquo; said Javert.</p><p>&ldquo;Turned out; so it be, then. That is well. I do not understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You shall understand, Mr. Mayor.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest, and resumed, still coldlyand sadly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Mayor, six weeks ago, in consequence of the scene over that woman, Iwas furious, and I informed against you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Informed against me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At the Prefecture of Police in Paris.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine, who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener thanJavert himself, burst out laughing now:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;As a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As an ex-convict.&rdquo;</p><p>The mayor turned livid.</p><p>Javert, who had not raised his eyes, went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought it was so. I had had an idea for a long time; a resemblance;inquiries which you had caused to be made at Faverolles; the strength ofyour loins; the adventure with old Fauchelevant; your skill inmarksmanship; your leg, which you drag a little;&mdash;I hardly know whatall,&mdash;absurdities! But, at all events, I took you for a certain JeanValjean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A certain&mdash;What did you say the name was?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jean Valjean. He was a convict whom I was in the habit of seeing twentyyears ago, when I was adjutant-guard of convicts at Toulon. On leaving thegalleys, this Jean Valjean, as it appears, robbed a bishop; then hecommitted another theft, accompanied with violence, on a public highway onthe person of a little Savoyard. He disappeared eight years ago, no oneknows how, and he has been sought, I fancied. In short, I did this thing!Wrath impelled me; I denounced you at the Prefecture!&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine, who had taken up the docket again several moments beforethis, resumed with an air of perfect indifference:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And what reply did you receive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I was mad.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, they were right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is lucky that you recognize the fact.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am forced to do so, since the real Jean Valjean has been found.&rdquo;</p><p>The sheet of paper which M. Madeleine was holding dropped from his hand;he raised his head, gazed fixedly at Javert, and said with hisindescribable accent:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p><p>Javert continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;This is the way it is, Mr. Mayor. It seems that there was in theneighborhood near Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher an old fellow who was calledFather Champmathieu. He was a very wretched creature. No one paid anyattention to him. No one knows what such people subsist on. Lately, lastautumn, Father Champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some ciderapples from&mdash;Well, no matter, a theft had been committed, a wallscaled, branches of trees broken. My Champmathieu was arrested. He stillhad the branch of apple-tree in his hand. The scamp is locked up. Up tothis point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor. But here is whereProvidence intervened.</p><p>&ldquo;The jail being in a bad condition, the examining magistrate finds itconvenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras, where the departmental prison issituated. In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict named Brevet, who isdetained for I know not what, and who has been appointed turnkey of the house,because of good behavior. Mr. Mayor, no sooner had Champmathieu arrived thanBrevet exclaims: &lsquo;Eh! Why, I know that man! He is a<i>fagot!</i><a href="#linknote-4" name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4">4</a>Take a good look at me, my good man! You are Jean Valjean!&rsquo; &lsquo;JeanValjean! who&rsquo;s Jean Valjean?&rsquo; Champmathieu feigns astonishment.&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t play the innocent dodge,&rsquo; says Brevet. &lsquo;You areJean Valjean! You have been in the galleys of Toulon; it was twenty years ago;we were there together.&rsquo; Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu! You understand.The case is investigated. The thing was well ventilated for me. This is whatthey discovered: This Champmathieu had been, thirty years ago, a pruner oftrees in various localities, notably at Faverolles. There all trace of him waslost. A long time afterwards he was seen again in Auvergne; then in Paris,where he is said to have been a wheelwright, and to have had a daughter, whowas a laundress; but that has not been proved. Now, before going to the galleysfor theft, what was Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where? At Faverolles.Another fact. This Valjean&rsquo;s Christian name was Jean, and hismother&rsquo;s surname was Mathieu. What more natural to suppose than that, onemerging from the galleys, he should have taken his mother&rsquo;s name for thepurpose of concealing himself, and have called himself Jean Mathieu? He goes toAuvergne. The local pronunciation turns <i>Jean</i> into <i>Chan</i>&mdash;heis called Chan Mathieu. Our man offers no opposition, and behold himtransformed into Champmathieu. You follow me, do you not? Inquiries were madeat Faverolles. The family of Jean Valjean is no longer there. It is not knownwhere they have gone. You know that among those classes a family oftendisappears. Search was made, and nothing was found. When such people are notmud, they are dust. And then, as the beginning of the story dates thirty yearsback, there is no longer any one at Faverolles who knew Jean Valjean. Inquirieswere made at Toulon. Besides Brevet, there are only two convicts in existencewho have seen Jean Valjean; they are Cochepaille and Chenildieu, and aresentenced for life. They are taken from the galleys and confronted with thepretended Champmathieu. They do not hesitate; he is Jean Valjean for them aswell as for Brevet. The same age,&mdash;he is fifty-four,&mdash;the sameheight, the same air, the same man; in short, it is he. It was precisely atthis moment that I forwarded my denunciation to the Prefecture in Paris. I wastold that I had lost my reason, and that Jean Valjean is at Arras, in the powerof the authorities. You can imagine whether this surprised me, when I thoughtthat I had that same Jean Valjean here. I write to the examining judge; hesends for me; Champmathieu is conducted to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; interposed M. Madeleine.</p><p>Javert replied, his face incorruptible, and as melancholy as ever:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Mayor, the truth is the truth. I am sorry; but that man is JeanValjean. I recognized him also.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine resumed in, a very low voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo;</p><p>Javert began to laugh, with that mournful laugh which comes from profoundconviction.</p><p>&ldquo;O! Sure!&rdquo;</p><p>He stood there thoughtfully for a moment, mechanically taking pinches ofpowdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on thetable, and he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And even now that I have seen the real Jean Valjean, I do not see how Icould have thought otherwise. I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert, as he addressed these grave and supplicating words to the man, whosix weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the wholestation-house, and bade him &ldquo;leave the room,&rdquo;&mdash;Javert, that haughtyman, was unconsciously full of simplicity and dignity,&mdash;M. Madeleinemade no other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And what does this man say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Indeed, Mr. Mayor, it&rsquo;s a bad business. If he is Jean Valjean, he hashis previous conviction against him. To climb a wall, to break a branch,to purloin apples, is a mischievous trick in a child; for a man it is amisdemeanor; for a convict it is a crime. Robbing and housebreaking&mdash;itis all there. It is no longer a question of correctional police; it is amatter for the Court of Assizes. It is no longer a matter of a few days inprison; it is the galleys for life. And then, there is the affair with thelittle Savoyard, who will return, I hope. The deuce! there is plenty todispute in the matter, is there not? Yes, for any one but Jean Valjean.But Jean Valjean is a sly dog. That is the way I recognized him. Any otherman would have felt that things were getting hot for him; he wouldstruggle, he would cry out&mdash;the kettle sings before the fire; hewould not be Jean Valjean, <i>et cetera</i>. But he has not the appearanceof understanding; he says, &lsquo;I am Champmathieu, and I won&rsquo;t depart fromthat!&rsquo; He has an astonished air, he pretends to be stupid; it is farbetter. Oh! the rogue is clever! But it makes no difference. The proofsare there. He has been recognized by four persons; the old scamp will becondemned. The case has been taken to the Assizes at Arras. I shall gothere to give my testimony. I have been summoned.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine had turned to his desk again, and taken up his docket, andwas turning over the leaves tranquilly, reading and writing by turns, likea busy man. He turned to Javert:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That will do, Javert. In truth, all these details interest me but little.We are wasting our time, and we have pressing business on hand. Javert,you will betake yourself at once to the house of the woman Buseaupied, whosells herbs at the corner of the Rue Saint-Saulve. You will tell her thatshe must enter her complaint against carter Pierre Chesnelong. The man isa brute, who came near crushing this woman and her child. He must bepunished. You will then go to M. Charcellay, Rue Montre-de-Champigny. Hecomplained that there is a gutter on the adjoining house which dischargesrain-water on his premises, and is undermining the foundations of hishouse. After that, you will verify the infractions of police regulationswhich have been reported to me in the Rue Guibourg, at Widow Doris&rsquo;s, andRue du Garraud-Blanc, at Madame Renée le Bossé&rsquo;s, and you will preparedocuments. But I am giving you a great deal of work. Are you not to beabsent? Did you not tell me that you were going to Arras on that matter ina week or ten days?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sooner than that, Mr. Mayor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On what day, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, I thought that I had said to Monsieur le Maire that the case was tobe tried to-morrow, and that I am to set out by diligence to-night.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine made an imperceptible movement.</p><p>&ldquo;And how long will the case last?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One day, at the most. The judgment will be pronounced to-morrow eveningat latest. But I shall not wait for the sentence, which is certain; Ishall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; said M. Madeleine.</p><p>And he dismissed Javert with a wave of the hand.</p><p>Javert did not withdraw.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Mayor,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it now?&rdquo; demanded M. Madeleine.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Mayor, there is still something of which I must remind you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I must be dismissed.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine rose.</p><p>&ldquo;Javert, you are a man of honor, and I esteem you. You exaggerate yourfault. Moreover, this is an offence which concerns me. Javert, you deservepromotion instead of degradation. I wish you to retain your post.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert gazed at M. Madeleine with his candid eyes, in whose depths his notvery enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible, and said ina tranquil voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Mayor, I cannot grant you that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I repeat,&rdquo; replied M. Madeleine, &ldquo;that the matter concerns me.&rdquo;</p><p>But Javert, heeding his own thought only, continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;So far as exaggeration is concerned, I am not exaggerating. This is theway I reason: I have suspected you unjustly. That is nothing. It is ourright to cherish suspicion, although suspicion directed above ourselves isan abuse. But without proofs, in a fit of rage, with the object ofwreaking my vengeance, I have denounced you as a convict, you, arespectable man, a mayor, a magistrate! That is serious, very serious. Ihave insulted authority in your person, I, an agent of the authorities! Ifone of my subordinates had done what I have done, I should have declaredhim unworthy of the service, and have expelled him. Well? Stop, Mr. Mayor;one word more. I have often been severe in the course of my life towardsothers. That is just. I have done well. Now, if I were not severe towardsmyself, all the justice that I have done would become injustice. Ought Ito spare myself more than others? No! What! I should be good for nothingbut to chastise others, and not myself! Why, I should be a blackguard!Those who say, &lsquo;That blackguard of a Javert!&rsquo; would be in the right. Mr.Mayor, I do not desire that you should treat me kindly; your kindnessroused sufficient bad blood in me when it was directed to others. I wantnone of it for myself. The kindness which consists in upholding a woman ofthe town against a citizen, the police agent against the mayor, the manwho is down against the man who is up in the world, is what I call falsekindness. That is the sort of kindness which disorganizes society. GoodGod! it is very easy to be kind; the difficulty lies in being just. Come!if you had been what I thought you, I should not have been kind to you,not I! You would have seen! Mr. Mayor, I must treat myself as I wouldtreat any other man. When I have subdued malefactors, when I haveproceeded with vigor against rascals, I have often said to myself, &lsquo;If youflinch, if I ever catch you in fault, you may rest at your ease!&rsquo; I haveflinched, I have caught myself in a fault. So much the worse! Come,discharged, cashiered, expelled! That is well. I have arms. I will tillthe soil; it makes no difference to me. Mr. Mayor, the good of the servicedemands an example. I simply require the discharge of Inspector Javert.&rdquo;</p><p>All this was uttered in a proud, humble, despairing, yet convinced tone,which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular, honest man.</p><p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said M. Madeleine.</p><p>And he offered him his hand.</p><p>Javert recoiled, and said in a wild voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but this must not be. A mayor does not offer hishand to a police spy.&rdquo;</p><p>He added between his teeth:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;A police spy, yes; from the moment when I have misused the police. I amno more than a police spy.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he bowed profoundly, and directed his steps towards the door.</p><p>There he wheeled round, and with eyes still downcast:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Mayor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall continue to serve until I am superseded.&rdquo;</p><p>He withdrew. M. Madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm,sure step, which died away on the pavement of the corridor.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0065" id="link2H_4_0065"></a>BOOK SEVENTH&mdash;THE CHAMPMATHIEU AFFAIR</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0055" id="link2HCH0055"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;SISTER SIMPLICE</h3><p>The incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known at M. surM. But the small portion of them which became known left such a memory inthat town that a serious gap would exist in this book if we did notnarrate them in their most minute details. Among these details the readerwill encounter two or three improbable circumstances, which we preserveout of respect for the truth.</p><p>On the afternoon following the visit of Javert, M. Madeleine went to seeFantine according to his wont.</p><p>Before entering Fantine&rsquo;s room, he had Sister Simplice summoned.</p><p>The two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary,Lazariste ladies, like all sisters of charity, bore the names of SisterPerpétue and Sister Simplice.</p><p>Sister Perpétue was an ordinary villager, a sister of charity in a coarsestyle, who had entered the service of God as one enters any other service.She was a nun as other women are cooks. This type is not so very rare. Themonastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasant earthenware, which iseasily fashioned into a Capuchin or an Ursuline. These rustics areutilized for the rough work of devotion. The transition from a drover to aCarmelite is not in the least violent; the one turns into the otherwithout much effort; the fund of ignorance common to the village and thecloister is a preparation ready at hand, and places the boor at once onthe same footing as the monk: a little more amplitude in the smock, and itbecomes a frock. Sister Perpétue was a robust nun from Marines nearPontoise, who chattered her patois, droned, grumbled, sugared the potionaccording to the bigotry or the hypocrisy of the invalid, treated herpatients abruptly, roughly, was crabbed with the dying, almost flung Godin their faces, stoned their death agony with prayers mumbled in a rage;was bold, honest, and ruddy.</p><p>Sister Simplice was white, with a waxen pallor. Beside Sister Perpétue,she was the taper beside the candle. Vincent de Paul has divinely tracedthe features of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words, in whichhe mingles as much freedom as servitude: &ldquo;They shall have for theirconvent only the house of the sick; for cell only a hired room; for chapelonly their parish church; for cloister only the streets of the town andthe wards of the hospitals; for enclosure only obedience; for gratingsonly the fear of God; for veil only modesty.&rdquo; This ideal was realized inthe living person of Sister Simplice: she had never been young, and itseemed as though she would never grow old. No one could have told SisterSimplice&rsquo;s age. She was a person&mdash;we dare not say a woman&mdash;whowas gentle, austere, well-bred, cold, and who had never lied. She was sogentle that she appeared fragile; but she was more solid than granite. Shetouched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure and fine. Therewas, so to speak, silence in her speech; she said just what was necessary,and she possessed a tone of voice which would have equally edified aconfessional or enchanted a drawing-room. This delicacy accommodateditself to the serge gown, finding in this harsh contact a continualreminder of heaven and of God. Let us emphasize one detail. Never to havelied, never to have said, for any interest whatever, even in indifference,any single thing which was not the truth, the sacred truth, was SisterSimplice&rsquo;s distinctive trait; it was the accent of her virtue. She wasalmost renowned in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity. TheAbbé Sicard speaks of Sister Simplice in a letter to the deaf-muteMassieu. However pure and sincere we may be, we all bear upon our candorthe crack of the little, innocent lie. She did not. Little lie, innocentlie&mdash;does such a thing exist? To lie is the absolute form of evil. Tolie a little is not possible: he who lies, lies the whole lie. To lie isthe very face of the demon. Satan has two names; he is called Satan andLying. That is what she thought; and as she thought, so she did. Theresult was the whiteness which we have mentioned&mdash;a whiteness whichcovered even her lips and her eyes with radiance. Her smile was white, herglance was white. There was not a single spider&rsquo;s web, not a grain ofdust, on the glass window of that conscience. On entering the order ofSaint Vincent de Paul, she had taken the name of Simplice by specialchoice. Simplice of Sicily, as we know, is the saint who preferred toallow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had beenborn at Segesta when she had been born at Syracuse&mdash;a lie which wouldhave saved her. This patron saint suited this soul.</p><p>Sister Simplice, on her entrance into the order, had had two faults whichshe had gradually corrected: she had a taste for dainties, and she likedto receive letters. She never read anything but a book of prayers printedin Latin, in coarse type. She did not understand Latin, but she understoodthe book.</p><p>This pious woman had conceived an affection for Fantine, probably feelinga latent virtue there, and she had devoted herself almost exclusively toher care.</p><p>M. Madeleine took Sister Simplice apart and recommended Fantine to her ina singular tone, which the sister recalled later on.</p><p>On leaving the sister, he approached Fantine.</p><p>Fantine awaited M. Madeleine&rsquo;s appearance every day as one awaits a ray ofwarmth and joy. She said to the sisters, &ldquo;I only live when Monsieur leMaire is here.&rdquo;</p><p>She had a great deal of fever that day. As soon as she saw M. Madeleineshe asked him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And Cosette?&rdquo;</p><p>He replied with a smile:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Soon.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine was the same as usual with Fantine. Only he remained an hourinstead of half an hour, to Fantine&rsquo;s great delight. He urged every onerepeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything. It was noticedthat there was a moment when his countenance became very sombre. But thiswas explained when it became known that the doctor had bent down to hisear and said to him, &ldquo;She is losing ground fast.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he returned to the town-hall, and the clerk observed him attentivelyexamining a road map of France which hung in his study. He wrote a fewfigures on a bit of paper with a pencil.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0056" id="link2HCH0056"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE PERSPICACITY OF MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE</h3><p>From the town-hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town, to aFleming named Master Scaufflaer, French Scaufflaire, who let out &ldquo;horsesand cabriolets as desired.&rdquo;</p><p>In order to reach this Scaufflaire, the shortest way was to take thelittle-frequented street in which was situated the parsonage of the parishin which M. Madeleine resided. The curé was, it was said, a worthy,respectable, and sensible man. At the moment when M. Madeleine arrived infront of the parsonage there was but one passer-by in the street, and thisperson noticed this: After the mayor had passed the priest&rsquo;s house hehalted, stood motionless, then turned about, and retraced his steps to thedoor of the parsonage, which had an iron knocker. He laid his hand quicklyon the knocker and lifted it; then he paused again and stopped short, asthough in thought, and after the lapse of a few seconds, instead ofallowing the knocker to fall abruptly, he placed it gently, and resumedhis way with a sort of haste which had not been apparent previously.</p><p>M. Madeleine found Master Scaufflaire at home, engaged in stitching aharness over.</p><p>&ldquo;Master Scaufflaire,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;have you a good horse?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Mayor,&rdquo; said the Fleming, &ldquo;all my horses are good. What do you meanby a good horse?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo; said the Fleming. &ldquo;Twenty leagues!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hitched to a cabriolet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how long can he rest at the end of his journey?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To traverse the same road?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The deuce! the deuce! And it is twenty leagues?&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled somefigures. He showed it to the Fleming. The figures were 5, 6, 8½.</p><p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;total, nineteen and a half; as well say twentyleagues.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Mayor,&rdquo; returned the Fleming, &ldquo;I have just what you want. My littlewhite horse&mdash;you may have seen him pass occasionally; he is a smallbeast from Lower Boulonnais. He is full of fire. They wanted to make asaddle-horse of him at first. Bah! He reared, he kicked, he laid everybodyflat on the ground. He was thought to be vicious, and no one knew what todo with him. I bought him. I harnessed him to a carriage. That is what hewanted, sir; he is as gentle as a girl; he goes like the wind. Ah! indeedhe must not be mounted. It does not suit his ideas to be a saddle-horse.Every one has his ambition. &lsquo;Draw? Yes. Carry? No.&rsquo; We must suppose thatis what he said to himself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And he will accomplish the trip?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your twenty leagues all at a full trot, and in less than eight hours. Buthere are the conditions.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;State them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the first place, you will give him half an hour&rsquo;s breathing spellmidway of the road; he will eat; and some one must be by while he iseating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats; for Ihave noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stable menthan eaten by the horses.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some one will be by.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the second place&mdash;is the cabriolet for Monsieur le Maire?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does Monsieur le Maire know how to drive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Monsieur le Maire will travel alone and without baggage, in ordernot to overload the horse?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But as Monsieur le Maire will have no one with him, he will be obliged totake the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is understood.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am to have thirty francs a day. The days of rest to be paid for also&mdash;nota farthing less; and the beast&rsquo;s food to be at Monsieur le Maire&rsquo;sexpense.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid them on thetable.</p><p>&ldquo;Here is the pay for two days in advance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fourthly, for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy, and wouldfatigue the horse. Monsieur le Maire must consent to travel in a littletilbury that I own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I consent to that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is light, but it has no cover.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That makes no difference to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Has Monsieur le Maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter?&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine did not reply. The Fleming resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That it is very cold?&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine preserved silence.</p><p>Master Scaufflaire continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That it may rain?&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine raised his head and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door to-morrow morningat half-past four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, Monsieur le Maire,&rdquo; replied Scaufflaire; then, scratching aspeck in the wood of the table with his thumb-nail, he resumed with thatcareless air which the Flemings understand so well how to mingle withtheir shrewdness:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;But this is what I am thinking of now: Monsieur le Maire has not told mewhere he is going. Where is Monsieur le Maire going?&rdquo;</p><p>He had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of theconversation, but he did not know why he had not dared to put thequestion.</p><p>&ldquo;Are your horse&rsquo;s forelegs good?&rdquo; said M. Madeleine.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur le Maire. You must hold him in a little when going downhill. Are there many descends between here and the place whither you aregoing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do not forget to be at my door at precisely half-past four o&rsquo;clockto-morrow morning,&rdquo; replied M. Madeleine; and he took his departure.</p><p>The Fleming remained &ldquo;utterly stupid,&rdquo; as he himself said some timeafterwards.</p><p>The mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again;it was the mayor once more.</p><p>He still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Scaufflaire,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;at what sum do you estimate the value ofthe horse and tilbury which you are to let to me,&mdash;the one bearingthe other?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The one dragging the other, Monsieur le Maire,&rdquo; said the Fleming, with abroad smile.</p><p>&ldquo;So be it. Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does Monsieur le Maire wish to purchase them or me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No; but I wish to guarantee you in any case. You shall give me back thesum at my return. At what value do you estimate your horse and cabriolet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Five hundred francs, Monsieur le Maire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine laid a bank-bill on the table, then left the room; and thistime he did not return.</p><p>Master Scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he had not said athousand francs. Besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but ahundred crowns.</p><p>The Fleming called his wife, and related the affair to her. &ldquo;Where thedevil could Monsieur le Maire be going?&rdquo; They held counsel together. &ldquo;Heis going to Paris,&rdquo; said the wife. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said the husband.</p><p>M. Madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it, and it lay onthe chimney-piece. The Fleming picked it up and studied it. &ldquo;Five, six,eight and a half? That must designate the posting relays.&rdquo; He turned tohis wife:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have found out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is five leagues from here to Hesdin, six from Hesdin to Saint-Pol,eight and a half from Saint-Pol to Arras. He is going to Arras.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, M. Madeleine had returned home. He had taken the longest way toreturn from Master Scaufflaire&rsquo;s, as though the parsonage door had been atemptation for him, and he had wished to avoid it. He ascended to hisroom, and there he shut himself up, which was a very simple act, since heliked to go to bed early. Nevertheless, the portress of the factory, whowas, at the same time, M. Madeleine&rsquo;s only servant, noticed that thelatter&rsquo;s light was extinguished at half-past eight, and she mentioned itto the cashier when he came home, adding:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is Monsieur le Maire ill? I thought he had a rather singular air.&rdquo;</p><p>This cashier occupied a room situated directly under M. Madeleine&rsquo;schamber. He paid no heed to the portress&rsquo;s words, but went to bed and tosleep. Towards midnight he woke up with a start; in his sleep he had hearda noise above his head. He listened; it was a footstep pacing back andforth, as though some one were walking in the room above him. He listenedmore attentively, and recognized M. Madeleine&rsquo;s step. This struck him asstrange; usually, there was no noise in M. Madeleine&rsquo;s chamber until herose in the morning. A moment later the cashier heard a noise whichresembled that of a cupboard being opened, and then shut again; then apiece of furniture was disarranged; then a pause ensued; then the stepbegan again. The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake now, and staring; andthrough his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted windowreflected on the opposite wall; from the direction of the rays, it couldonly come from the window of M. Madeleine&rsquo;s chamber. The reflectionwavered, as though it came rather from a fire which had been lighted thanfrom a candle. The shadow of the window-frame was not shown, whichindicated that the window was wide open. The fact that this window wasopen in such cold weather was surprising. The cashier fell asleep again.An hour or two later he waked again. The same step was still passingslowly and regularly back and forth overhead.</p><p>The reflection was still visible on the wall, but now it was pale andpeaceful, like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle. The window wasstill open.</p><p>This is what had taken place in M. Madeleine&rsquo;s room.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0057" id="link2HCH0057"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;A TEMPEST IN A SKULL</h3><p>The reader has, no doubt, already divined that M. Madeleine is no otherthan Jean Valjean.</p><p>We have already gazed into the depths of this conscience; the moment hasnow come when we must take another look into it. We do so not withoutemotion and trepidation. There is nothing more terrible in existence thanthis sort of contemplation. The eye of the spirit can nowhere find moredazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man; it can fix itself on noother thing which is more formidable, more complicated, more mysterious,and more infinite. There is a spectacle more grand than the sea; it isheaven: there is a spectacle more grand than heaven; it is the inmostrecesses of the soul.</p><p>To make the poem of the human conscience, were it only with reference to asingle man, were it only in connection with the basest of men, would be toblend all epics into one superior and definitive epic. Conscience is thechaos of chimæras, of lusts, and of temptations; the furnace of dreams;the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed; it is the pandemonium ofsophisms; it is the battlefield of the passions. Penetrate, at certainhours, past the livid face of a human being who is engaged in reflection,and look behind, gaze into that soul, gaze into that obscurity. There,beneath that external silence, battles of giants, like those recorded inHomer, are in progress; skirmishes of dragons and hydras and swarms ofphantoms, as in Milton; visionary circles, as in Dante. What a solemnthing is this infinity which every man bears within him, and which hemeasures with despair against the caprices of his brain and the actions ofhis life!</p><p>Alighieri one day met with a sinister-looking door, before which hehesitated. Here is one before us, upon whose threshold we hesitate. Let usenter, nevertheless.</p><p>We have but little to add to what the reader already knows of what hadhappened to Jean Valjean after the adventure with Little Gervais. Fromthat moment forth he was, as we have seen, a totally different man. Whatthe Bishop had wished to make of him, that he carried out. It was morethan a transformation; it was a transfiguration.</p><p>He succeeded in disappearing, sold the Bishop&rsquo;s silver, reserving only thecandlesticks as a souvenir, crept from town to town, traversed France,came to M. sur M., conceived the idea which we have mentioned,accomplished what we have related, succeeded in rendering himself safefrom seizure and inaccessible, and, thenceforth, established at M. sur M.,happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the first half ofhis existence belied by the last, he lived in peace, reassured andhopeful, having henceforth only two thoughts,&mdash;to conceal his nameand to sanctify his life; to escape men and to return to God.</p><p>These two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind that theyformed but a single one there; both were equally absorbing and imperativeand ruled his slightest actions. In general, they conspired to regulatethe conduct of his life; they turned him towards the gloom; they renderedhim kindly and simple; they counselled him to the same things. Sometimes,however, they conflicted. In that case, as the reader will remember, theman whom all the country of M. sur M. called M. Madeleine did not hesitateto sacrifice the first to the second&mdash;his security to his virtue.Thus, in spite of all his reserve and all his prudence, he had preservedthe Bishop&rsquo;s candlesticks, worn mourning for him, summoned andinterrogated all the little Savoyards who passed that way, collectedinformation regarding the families at Faverolles, and saved oldFauchelevent&rsquo;s life, despite the disquieting insinuations of Javert. Itseemed, as we have already remarked, as though he thought, following theexample of all those who have been wise, holy, and just, that his firstduty was not towards himself.</p><p>At the same time, it must be confessed, nothing just like this had yetpresented itself.</p><p>Never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings weare narrating, engaged in so serious a struggle. He understood thisconfusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by Javert,when the latter entered his study. At the moment when that name, which hehad buried beneath so many layers, was so strangely articulated, he wasstruck with stupor, and as though intoxicated with the sinistereccentricity of his destiny; and through this stupor he felt that shudderwhich precedes great shocks. He bent like an oak at the approach of astorm, like a soldier at the approach of an assault. He felt shadowsfilled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his head. As helistened to Javert, the first thought which occurred to him was to go, torun and denounce himself, to take that Champmathieu out of prison andplace himself there; this was as painful and as poignant as an incision inthe living flesh. Then it passed away, and he said to himself, &ldquo;We willsee! We will see!&rdquo; He repressed this first, generous instinct, andrecoiled before heroism.</p><p>It would be beautiful, no doubt, after the Bishop&rsquo;s holy words, after somany years of repentance and abnegation, in the midst of a penitenceadmirably begun, if this man had not flinched for an instant, even in thepresence of so terrible a conjecture, but had continued to walk with thesame step towards this yawning precipice, at the bottom of which layheaven; that would have been beautiful; but it was not thus. We mustrender an account of the things which went on in this soul, and we canonly tell what there was there. He was carried away, at first, by theinstinct of self-preservation; he rallied all his ideas in haste, stifledhis emotions, took into consideration Javert&rsquo;s presence, that greatdanger, postponed all decision with the firmness of terror, shook offthought as to what he had to do, and resumed his calmness as a warriorpicks up his buckler.</p><p>He remained in this state during the rest of the day, a whirlwind within,a profound tranquillity without. He took no &ldquo;preservative measures,&rdquo; asthey may be called. Everything was still confused, and jostling togetherin his brain. His trouble was so great that he could not perceive the formof a single idea distinctly, and he could have told nothing about himself,except that he had received a great blow.</p><p>He repaired to Fantine&rsquo;s bed of suffering, as usual, and prolonged hisvisit, through a kindly instinct, telling himself that he must behavethus, and recommend her well to the sisters, in case he should be obligedto be absent himself. He had a vague feeling that he might be obliged togo to Arras; and without having the least in the world made up his mind tothis trip, he said to himself that being, as he was, beyond the shadow ofany suspicion, there could be nothing out of the way in being a witness towhat was to take place, and he engaged the tilbury from Scaufflaire inorder to be prepared in any event.</p><p>He dined with a good deal of appetite.</p><p>On returning to his room, he communed with himself.</p><p>He examined the situation, and found it unprecedented; so unprecedentedthat in the midst of his reverie he rose from his chair, moved by someinexplicable impulse of anxiety, and bolted his door. He feared lestsomething more should enter. He was barricading himself againstpossibilities.</p><p>A moment later he extinguished his light; it embarrassed him.</p><p>It seemed to him as though he might be seen.</p><p>By whom?</p><p>Alas! That on which he desired to close the door had already entered; thatwhich he desired to blind was staring him in the face,&mdash;hisconscience.</p><p>His conscience; that is to say, God.</p><p>Nevertheless, he deluded himself at first; he had a feeling of securityand of solitude; the bolt once drawn, he thought himself impregnable; thecandle extinguished, he felt himself invisible. Then he took possession ofhimself: he set his elbows on the table, leaned his head on his hand, andbegan to meditate in the dark.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do I stand? Am not I dreaming? What have I heard? Is it really truethat I have seen that Javert, and that he spoke to me in that manner? Whocan that Champmathieu be? So he resembles me! Is it possible? When Ireflect that yesterday I was so tranquil, and so far from suspectinganything! What was I doing yesterday at this hour? What is there in thisincident? What will the end be? What is to be done?&rdquo;</p><p>This was the torment in which he found himself. His brain had lost itspower of retaining ideas; they passed like waves, and he clutched his browin both hands to arrest them.</p><p>Nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which overwhelmedhis will and his reason, and from which he sought to draw proof andresolution.</p><p>His head was burning. He went to the window and threw it wide open. Therewere no stars in the sky. He returned and seated himself at the table.</p><p>The first hour passed in this manner.</p><p>Gradually, however, vague outlines began to take form and to fixthemselves in his meditation, and he was able to catch a glimpse withprecision of the reality,&mdash;not the whole situation, but some of thedetails. He began by recognizing the fact that, critical and extraordinaryas was this situation, he was completely master of it.</p><p>This only caused an increase of his stupor.</p><p>Independently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned to hisactions, all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a holein which to bury his name. That which he had always feared most of all inhis hours of self-communion, during his sleepless nights, was to ever hearthat name pronounced; he had said to himself, that that would be the endof all things for him; that on the day when that name made itsreappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about him, and&mdash;whoknows?&mdash;perhaps even his new soul within him, also. He shuddered atthe very thought that this was possible. Assuredly, if any one had said tohim at such moments that the hour would come when that name would ring inhis ears, when the hideous words, Jean Valjean, would suddenly emerge fromthe darkness and rise in front of him, when that formidable light, capableof dissipating the mystery in which he had enveloped himself, wouldsuddenly blaze forth above his head, and that that name would not menacehim, that that light would but produce an obscurity more dense, that thisrent veil would but increase the mystery, that this earthquake wouldsolidify his edifice, that this prodigious incident would have no otherresult, so far as he was concerned, if so it seemed good to him, than thatof rendering his existence at once clearer and more impenetrable, andthat, out of his confrontation with the phantom of Jean Valjean, the goodand worthy citizen Monsieur Madeleine would emerge more honored, morepeaceful, and more respected than ever&mdash;if any one had told him that,he would have tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman.Well, all this was precisely what had just come to pass; all thataccumulation of impossibilities was a fact, and God had permitted thesewild fancies to become real things!</p><p>His reverie continued to grow clearer. He came more and more to anunderstanding of his position.</p><p>It seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicabledream, and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the middleof the night, erect, shivering, holding back all in vain, on the verybrink of the abyss. He distinctly perceived in the darkness a stranger, aman unknown to him, whom destiny had mistaken for him, and whom she wasthrusting into the gulf in his stead; in order that the gulf might closeonce more, it was necessary that some one, himself or that other man,should fall into it: he had only let things take their course.</p><p>The light became complete, and he acknowledged this to himself: That hisplace was empty in the galleys; that do what he would, it was stillawaiting him; that the theft from little Gervais had led him back to it;that this vacant place would await him, and draw him on until he filledit; that this was inevitable and fatal; and then he said to himself,&ldquo;that, at this moment, he had a substitute; that it appeared that acertain Champmathieu had that ill luck, and that, as regards himself,being present in the galleys in the person of that Champmathieu, presentin society under the name of M. Madeleine, he had nothing more to fear,provided that he did not prevent men from sealing over the head of thatChampmathieu this stone of infamy which, like the stone of the sepulchre,falls once, never to rise again.&rdquo;</p><p>All this was so strange and so violent, that there suddenly took place inhim that indescribable movement, which no man feels more than two or threetimes in the course of his life, a sort of convulsion of the consciencewhich stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart, which is composedof irony, of joy, and of despair, and which may be called an outburst ofinward laughter.</p><p>He hastily relighted his candle.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;what am I afraid of? What is therein all that for me to think about? I am safe; all is over. I had but onepartly open door through which my past might invade my life, and beholdthat door is walled up forever! That Javert, who has been annoying me solong; that terrible instinct which seemed to have divined me, which haddivined me&mdash;good God! and which followed me everywhere; thatfrightful hunting-dog, always making a point at me, is thrown off thescent, engaged elsewhere, absolutely turned from the trail: henceforth heis satisfied; he will leave me in peace; he has his Jean Valjean. Whoknows? it is even probable that he will wish to leave town! And all thishas been brought about without any aid from me, and I count for nothing init! Ah! but where is the misfortune in this? Upon my honor, people wouldthink, to see me, that some catastrophe had happened to me! After all, ifit does bring harm to some one, that is not my fault in the least: it isProvidence which has done it all; it is because it wishes it so to be,evidently. Have I the right to disarrange what it has arranged? What do Iask now? Why should I meddle? It does not concern me; what! I am notsatisfied: but what more do I want? The goal to which I have aspired forso many years, the dream of my nights, the object of my prayers to Heaven,&mdash;security,&mdash;Ihave now attained; it is God who wills it; I can do nothing against thewill of God, and why does God will it? In order that I may continue what Ihave begun, that I may do good, that I may one day be a grand andencouraging example, that it may be said at last, that a little happinesshas been attached to the penance which I have undergone, and to thatvirtue to which I have returned. Really, I do not understand why I wasafraid, a little while ago, to enter the house of that good curé, and toask his advice; this is evidently what he would have said to me: It issettled; let things take their course; let the good God do as he likes!&rdquo;</p><p>Thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience, bendingover what may be called his own abyss; he rose from his chair, and beganto pace the room: &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us think no more about it; myresolve is taken!&rdquo; but he felt no joy.</p><p>Quite the reverse.</p><p>One can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one can thesea from returning to the shore: the sailor calls it the tide; the guiltyman calls it remorse; God upheaves the soul as he does the ocean.</p><p>After the expiration of a few moments, do what he would, he resumed thegloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened, sayingthat which he would have preferred to ignore, and listened to that whichhe would have preferred not to hear, yielding to that mysterious powerwhich said to him: &ldquo;Think!&rdquo; as it said to another condemned man, twothousand years ago, &ldquo;March on!&rdquo;</p><p>Before proceeding further, and in order to make ourselves fullyunderstood, let us insist upon one necessary observation.</p><p>It is certain that people do talk to themselves; there is no living beingwho has not done it. It may even be said that the word is never a moremagnificent mystery than when it goes from thought to conscience within aman, and when it returns from conscience to thought; it is in this senseonly that the words so often employed in this chapter, <i>he said, heexclaimed</i>, must be understood; one speaks to one&rsquo;s self, talks toone&rsquo;s self, exclaims to one&rsquo;s self without breaking the external silence;there is a great tumult; everything about us talks except the mouth. Therealities of the soul are nonetheless realities because they are notvisible and palpable.</p><p>So he asked himself where he stood. He interrogated himself upon that&ldquo;settled resolve.&rdquo; He confessed to himself that all that he had justarranged in his mind was monstrous, that &ldquo;to let things take their course,to let the good God do as he liked,&rdquo; was simply horrible; to allow thiserror of fate and of men to be carried out, not to hinder it, to lendhimself to it through his silence, to do nothing, in short, was to doeverything! that this was hypocritical baseness in the last degree! thatit was a base, cowardly, sneaking, abject, hideous crime!</p><p>For the first time in eight years, the wretched man had just tasted thebitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action.</p><p>He spit it out with disgust.</p><p>He continued to question himself. He asked himself severely what he hadmeant by this, &ldquo;My object is attained!&rdquo; He declared to himself that hislife really had an object; but what object? To conceal his name? Todeceive the police? Was it for so petty a thing that he had done all thathe had done? Had he not another and a grand object, which was the true one&mdash;tosave, not his person, but his soul; to become honest and good once more;to be a just man? Was it not that above all, that alone, which he hadalways desired, which the Bishop had enjoined upon him&mdash;to shut thedoor on his past? But he was not shutting it! great God! he was re-openingit by committing an infamous action! He was becoming a thief once more,and the most odious of thieves! He was robbing another of his existence,his life, his peace, his place in the sunshine. He was becoming anassassin. He was murdering, morally murdering, a wretched man. He wasinflicting on him that frightful living death, that death beneath the opensky, which is called the galleys. On the other hand, to surrender himselfto save that man, struck down with so melancholy an error, to resume hisown name, to become once more, out of duty, the convict Jean Valjean, thatwas, in truth, to achieve his resurrection, and to close forever that hellwhence he had just emerged; to fall back there in appearance was to escapefrom it in reality. This must be done! He had done nothing if he did notdo all this; his whole life was useless; all his penitence was wasted.There was no longer any need of saying, &ldquo;What is the use?&rdquo; He felt thatthe Bishop was there, that the Bishop was present all the more because hewas dead, that the Bishop was gazing fixedly at him, that henceforth MayorMadeleine, with all his virtues, would be abominable to him, and that theconvict Jean Valjean would be pure and admirable in his sight; that menbeheld his mask, but that the Bishop saw his face; that men saw his life,but that the Bishop beheld his conscience. So he must go to Arras, deliverthe false Jean Valjean, and denounce the real one. Alas! that was thegreatest of sacrifices, the most poignant of victories, the last step totake; but it must be done. Sad fate! he would enter into sanctity only inthe eyes of God when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us decide upon this; let us do our duty; let us savethis man.&rdquo; He uttered these words aloud, without perceiving that he wasspeaking aloud.</p><p>He took his books, verified them, and put them in order. He flung in thefire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassedtradesmen. He wrote and sealed a letter, and on the envelope it might havebeen read, had there been any one in his chamber at the moment, <i>ToMonsieur Laffitte, Banker, Rue d&rsquo;Artois, Paris</i>. He drew from hissecretary a pocket-book which contained several bank-notes and thepassport of which he had made use that same year when he went to theelections.</p><p>Any one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts, intowhich there entered such grave thought, would have had no suspicion ofwhat was going on within him. Only occasionally did his lips move; atother times he raised his head and fixed his gaze upon some point of thewall, as though there existed at that point something which he wished toelucidate or interrogate.</p><p>When he had finished the letter to M. Laffitte, he put it into his pocket,together with the pocket-book, and began his walk once more.</p><p>His reverie had not swerved from its course. He continued to see his dutyclearly, written in luminous letters, which flamed before his eyes andchanged its place as he altered the direction of his glance:&mdash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Go! Tell your name! Denounce yourself!&rdquo;</i></p><p>In the same way he beheld, as though they had passed before him in visibleforms, the two ideas which had, up to that time, formed the double rule ofhis soul,&mdash;the concealment of his name, the sanctification of hislife. For the first time they appeared to him as absolutely distinct, andhe perceived the distance which separated them. He recognized the factthat one of these ideas was, necessarily, good, while the other mightbecome bad; that the first was self-devotion, and that the other waspersonality; that the one said, <i>my neighbour</i>, and that the othersaid, <i>myself</i>; that one emanated from the light, and the other fromdarkness.</p><p>They were antagonistic. He saw them in conflict. In proportion as hemeditated, they grew before the eyes of his spirit. They had now attainedcolossal statures, and it seemed to him that he beheld within himself, inthat infinity of which we were recently speaking, in the midst of thedarkness and the lights, a goddess and a giant contending.</p><p>He was filled with terror; but it seemed to him that the good thought wasgetting the upper hand.</p><p>He felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of hisconscience and of his destiny; that the Bishop had marked the first phaseof his new life, and that Champmathieu marked the second. After the grandcrisis, the grand test.</p><p>But the fever, allayed for an instant, gradually resumed possession ofhim. A thousand thoughts traversed his mind, but they continued to fortifyhim in his resolution.</p><p>One moment he said to himself that he was, perhaps, taking the matter tookeenly; that, after all, this Champmathieu was not interesting, and thathe had actually been guilty of theft.</p><p>He answered himself: &ldquo;If this man has, indeed, stolen a few apples, thatmeans a month in prison. It is a long way from that to the galleys. Andwho knows? Did he steal? Has it been proved? The name of Jean Valjeanoverwhelms him, and seems to dispense with proofs. Do not the attorneysfor the Crown always proceed in this manner? He is supposed to be a thiefbecause he is known to be a convict.&rdquo;</p><p>In another instant the thought had occurred to him that, when he denouncedhimself, the heroism of his deed might, perhaps, be taken intoconsideration, and his honest life for the last seven years, and what hehad done for the district, and that they would have mercy on him.</p><p>But this supposition vanished very quickly, and he smiled bitterly as heremembered that the theft of the forty sous from little Gervais put him inthe position of a man guilty of a second offence after conviction, thatthis affair would certainly come up, and, according to the precise termsof the law, would render him liable to penal servitude for life.</p><p>He turned aside from all illusions, detached himself more and more fromearth, and sought strength and consolation elsewhere. He told himself thathe must do his duty; that perhaps he should not be more unhappy afterdoing his duty than after having avoided it; that if he <i>allowed thingsto take their own course</i>, if he remained at M. sur M., hisconsideration, his good name, his good works, the deference and venerationpaid to him, his charity, his wealth, his popularity, his virtue, would beseasoned with a crime. And what would be the taste of all these holythings when bound up with this hideous thing? while, if he accomplishedhis sacrifice, a celestial idea would be mingled with the galleys, thepost, the iron necklet, the green cap, unceasing toil, and pitiless shame.</p><p>At length he told himself that it must be so, that his destiny was thusallotted, that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made onhigh, that, in any case, he must make his choice: virtue without andabomination within, or holiness within and infamy without.</p><p>The stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage tofail, but his brain grow weary. He began to think of other things, ofindifferent matters, in spite of himself.</p><p>The veins in his temples throbbed violently; he still paced to and fro;midnight sounded first from the parish church, then from the town-hall; hecounted the twelve strokes of the two clocks, and compared the sounds ofthe two bells; he recalled in this connection the fact that, a few dayspreviously, he had seen in an ironmonger&rsquo;s shop an ancient clock for sale,upon which was written the name, <i>Antoine-Albin de Romainville</i>.</p><p>He was cold; he lighted a small fire; it did not occur to him to close thewindow.</p><p>In the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor; he was obliged to make atolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of histhoughts before midnight had struck; he finally succeeded in doing this.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! yes,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I had resolved to inform against myself.&rdquo;</p><p>And then, all of a sudden, he thought of Fantine.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and what about that poor woman?&rdquo;</p><p>Here a fresh crisis declared itself.</p><p>Fantine, by appearing thus abruptly in his reverie, produced the effect ofan unexpected ray of light; it seemed to him as though everything abouthim were undergoing a change of aspect: he exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! but I have hitherto considered no one but myself; it is proper for meto hold my tongue or to denounce myself, to conceal my person or to savemy soul, to be a despicable and respected magistrate, or an infamous andvenerable convict; it is I, it is always I and nothing but I: but, goodGod! all this is egotism; these are diverse forms of egotism, but it isegotism all the same. What if I were to think a little about others? Thehighest holiness is to think of others; come, let us examine the matter.The <i>I</i> excepted, the <i>I</i> effaced, the <i>I</i> forgotten, whatwould be the result of all this? What if I denounce myself? I am arrested;this Champmathieu is released; I am put back in the galleys; that is well&mdash;andwhat then? What is going on here? Ah! here is a country, a town, here arefactories, an industry, workers, both men and women, aged grandsires,children, poor people! All this I have created; all these I provide withtheir living; everywhere where there is a smoking chimney, it is I whohave placed the brand on the hearth and meat in the pot; I have createdease, circulation, credit; before me there was nothing; I have elevated,vivified, informed with life, fecundated, stimulated, enriched the wholecountry-side; lacking me, the soul is lacking; I take myself off,everything dies: and this woman, who has suffered so much, who possessesso many merits in spite of her fall; the cause of all whose misery I haveunwittingly been! And that child whom I meant to go in search of, whom Ihave promised to her mother; do I not also owe something to this woman, inreparation for the evil which I have done her? If I disappear, whathappens? The mother dies; the child becomes what it can; that is what willtake place, if I denounce myself. If I do not denounce myself? come, letus see how it will be if I do not denounce myself.&rdquo;</p><p>After putting this question to himself, he paused; he seemed to undergo amomentary hesitation and trepidation; but it did not last long, and heanswered himself calmly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, this man is going to the galleys; it is true, but what the deuce!he has stolen! There is no use in my saying that he has not been guilty oftheft, for he has! I remain here; I go on: in ten years I shall have madeten millions; I scatter them over the country; I have nothing of my own;what is that to me? It is not for myself that I am doing it; theprosperity of all goes on augmenting; industries are aroused and animated;factories and shops are multiplied; families, a hundred families, athousand families, are happy; the district becomes populated; villagesspring up where there were only farms before; farms rise where there wasnothing; wretchedness disappears, and with wretchedness debauchery,prostitution, theft, murder; all vices disappear, all crimes: and thispoor mother rears her child; and behold a whole country rich and honest!Ah! I was a fool! I was absurd! what was that I was saying aboutdenouncing myself? I really must pay attention and not be precipitateabout anything. What! because it would have pleased me to play the grandand generous; this is melodrama, after all; because I should have thoughtof no one but myself, the idea! for the sake of saving from a punishment,a trifle exaggerated, perhaps, but just at bottom, no one knows whom, athief, a good-for-nothing, evidently, a whole country-side must perish! apoor woman must die in the hospital! a poor little girl must die in thestreet! like dogs; ah, this is abominable! And without the mother evenhaving seen her child once more, almost without the child&rsquo;s having knownher mother; and all that for the sake of an old wretch of an apple-thiefwho, most assuredly, has deserved the galleys for something else, if notfor that; fine scruples, indeed, which save a guilty man and sacrifice theinnocent, which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live atmost, and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel,and which sacrifice a whole population, mothers, wives, children. Thispoor little Cosette who has no one in the world but me, and who is, nodoubt, blue with cold at this moment in the den of those Thénardiers;those peoples are rascals; and I was going to neglect my duty towards allthese poor creatures; and I was going off to denounce myself; and I wasabout to commit that unspeakable folly! Let us put it at the worst:suppose that there is a wrong action on my part in this, and that myconscience will reproach me for it some day, to accept, for the good ofothers, these reproaches which weigh only on myself; this evil actionwhich compromises my soul alone; in that lies self-sacrifice; in thatalone there is virtue.&rdquo;</p><p>He rose and resumed his march; this time, he seemed to be content.</p><p>Diamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth; truths are foundonly in the depths of thought. It seemed to him, that, after havingdescended into these depths, after having long groped among the darkest ofthese shadows, he had at last found one of these diamonds, one of thesetruths, and that he now held it in his hand, and he was dazzled as hegazed upon it.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;this is right; I am on the right road; I have thesolution; I must end by holding fast to something; my resolve is taken;let things take their course; let us no longer vacillate; let us no longerhang back; this is for the interest of all, not for my own; I amMadeleine, and Madeleine I remain. Woe to the man who is Jean Valjean! Iam no longer he; I do not know that man; I no longer know anything; itturns out that some one is Jean Valjean at the present moment; let himlook out for himself; that does not concern me; it is a fatal name whichwas floating abroad in the night; if it halts and descends on a head, somuch the worse for that head.&rdquo;</p><p>He looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney-piece, andsaid:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold! it has relieved me to come to a decision; I am quite another mannow.&rdquo;</p><p>He proceeded a few paces further, then he stopped short.</p><p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must not flinch before any of the consequences of theresolution which I have once adopted; there are still threads which attachme to that Jean Valjean; they must be broken; in this very room there areobjects which would betray me, dumb things which would bear witnessagainst me; it is settled; all these things must disappear.&rdquo;</p><p>He fumbled in his pocket, drew out his purse, opened it, and took out asmall key; he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardly beseen, so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design whichcovered the wall-paper; a secret receptacle opened, a sort of falsecupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and the chimney-piece;in this hiding-place there were some rags&mdash;a blue linen blouse, anold pair of trousers, an old knapsack, and a huge thorn cudgel shod withiron at both ends. Those who had seen Jean Valjean at the epoch when hepassed through D&mdash;&mdash; in October, 1815, could easily haverecognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit.</p><p>He had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks, inorder to remind himself continually of his starting-point, but he hadconcealed all that came from the galleys, and he had allowed thecandlesticks which came from the Bishop to be seen.</p><p>He cast a furtive glance towards the door, as though he feared that itwould open in spite of the bolt which fastened it; then, with a quick andabrupt movement, he took the whole in his arms at once, without bestowingso much as a glance on the things which he had so religiously and soperilously preserved for so many years, and flung them all, rags, cudgel,knapsack, into the fire.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0011" id="linkimage-0011"></a><img src="images/1b7-3-into-the-fire.jpg" alt="Candlesticks Into the Fire" width="100%" /></div><p>He closed the false cupboard again, and with redoubled precautions,henceforth unnecessary, since it was now empty, he concealed the doorbehind a heavy piece of furniture, which he pushed in front of it.</p><p>After the lapse of a few seconds, the room and the opposite wall werelighted up with a fierce, red, tremulous glow. Everything was on fire; thethorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the chamber.</p><p>As the knapsack was consumed, together with the hideous rags which itcontained, it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes. By bendingover, one could have readily recognized a coin,&mdash;no doubt theforty-sou piece stolen from the little Savoyard.</p><p>He did not look at the fire, but paced back and forth with the same step.</p><p>All at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks, which shonevaguely on the chimney-piece, through the glow.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;the whole of Jean Valjean is still in them. They mustbe destroyed also.&rdquo;</p><p>He seized the two candlesticks.</p><p>There was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape, andconverted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal.</p><p>He bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment. He felt a senseof real comfort. &ldquo;How good warmth is!&rdquo; said he.</p><p>He stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks.</p><p>A minute more, and they were both in the fire.</p><p>At that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him shouting:&ldquo;Jean Valjean! Jean Valjean!&rdquo;</p><p>His hair rose upright: he became like a man who is listening to someterrible thing.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it! finish!&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;Complete what you are about!Destroy these candlesticks! Annihilate this souvenir! Forget the Bishop!Forget everything! Destroy this Champmathieu, do! That is right! Applaudyourself! So it is settled, resolved, fixed, agreed: here is an old manwho does not know what is wanted of him, who has, perhaps, done nothing,an innocent man, whose whole misfortune lies in your name, upon whom yourname weighs like a crime, who is about to be taken for you, who will becondemned, who will finish his days in abjectness and horror. That isgood! Be an honest man yourself; remain Monsieur le Maire; remainhonorable and honored; enrich the town; nourish the indigent; rear theorphan; live happy, virtuous, and admired; and, during this time, whileyou are here in the midst of joy and light, there will be a man who willwear your red blouse, who will bear your name in ignominy, and who willdrag your chain in the galleys. Yes, it is well arranged thus. Ah,wretch!&rdquo;</p><p>The perspiration streamed from his brow. He fixed a haggard eye on thecandlesticks. But that within him which had spoken had not finished. Thevoice continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Jean Valjean, there will be around you many voices, which will make agreat noise, which will talk very loud, and which will bless you, and onlyone which no one will hear, and which will curse you in the dark. Well!listen, infamous man! All those benedictions will fall back before theyreach heaven, and only the malediction will ascend to God.&rdquo;</p><p>This voice, feeble at first, and which had proceeded from the most obscuredepths of his conscience, had gradually become startling and formidable,and he now heard it in his very ear. It seemed to him that it had detacheditself from him, and that it was now speaking outside of him. He thoughtthat he heard the last words so distinctly, that he glanced around theroom in a sort of terror.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there any one here?&rdquo; he demanded aloud, in utter bewilderment.</p><p>Then he resumed, with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;How stupid I am! There can be no one!&rdquo;</p><p>There was some one; but the person who was there was of those whom thehuman eye cannot see.</p><p>He placed the candlesticks on the chimney-piece.</p><p>Then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp, which troubled thedreams of the sleeping man beneath him, and awoke him with a start.</p><p>This tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him. Itsometimes seems, on supreme occasions, as though people moved about forthe purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounter bychange of place. After the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew hisposition.</p><p>He now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which hehad arrived in turn. The two ideas which counselled him appeared to himequally fatal. What a fatality! What conjunction that that Champmathieushould have been taken for him; to be overwhelmed by precisely the meanswhich Providence seemed to have employed, at first, to strengthen hisposition!</p><p>There was a moment when he reflected on the future. Denounce himself,great God! Deliver himself up! With immense despair he faced all that heshould be obliged to leave, all that he should be obliged to take up oncemore. He should have to bid farewell to that existence which was so good,so pure, so radiant, to the respect of all, to honor, to liberty. Heshould never more stroll in the fields; he should never more hear thebirds sing in the month of May; he should never more bestow alms on thelittle children; he should never more experience the sweetness of havingglances of gratitude and love fixed upon him; he should quit that housewhich he had built, that little chamber! Everything seemed charming to himat that moment. Never again should he read those books; never more shouldhe write on that little table of white wood; his old portress, the onlyservant whom he kept, would never more bring him his coffee in themorning. Great God! instead of that, the convict gang, the iron necklet,the red waistcoat, the chain on his ankle, fatigue, the cell, the camp bedall those horrors which he knew so well! At his age, after having beenwhat he was! If he were only young again! but to be addressed in his oldage as &ldquo;thou&rdquo; by any one who pleased; to be searched by the convict-guard;to receive the galley-sergeant&rsquo;s cudgellings; to wear iron-bound shoes onhis bare feet; to have to stretch out his leg night and morning to thehammer of the roundsman who visits the gang; to submit to the curiosity ofstrangers, who would be told: &ldquo;That man yonder is the famous Jean Valjean,who was mayor of M. sur M.&rdquo;; and at night, dripping with perspiration,overwhelmed with lassitude, their green caps drawn over their eyes, toremount, two by two, the ladder staircase of the galleys beneath thesergeant&rsquo;s whip. Oh, what misery! Can destiny, then, be as malicious as anintelligent being, and become as monstrous as the human heart?</p><p>And do what he would, he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemmawhich lay at the foundation of his reverie: &ldquo;Should he remain in paradiseand become a demon? Should he return to hell and become an angel?&rdquo;</p><p>What was to be done? Great God! what was to be done?</p><p>The torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty wasunchained afresh within him. His ideas began to grow confused once more;they assumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is peculiarto despair. The name of Romainville recurred incessantly to his mind, withthe two verses of a song which he had heard in the past. He thought thatRomainville was a little grove near Paris, where young lovers go to plucklilacs in the month of April.</p><p>He wavered outwardly as well as inwardly. He walked like a little childwho is permitted to toddle alone.</p><p>At intervals, as he combated his lassitude, he made an effort to recoverthe mastery of his mind. He tried to put to himself, for the last time,and definitely, the problem over which he had, in a manner, fallenprostrate with fatigue: Ought he to denounce himself? Ought he to hold hispeace? He could not manage to see anything distinctly. The vague aspectsof all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out by hismeditations quivered and vanished, one after the other, into smoke. Heonly felt that, to whatever course of action he made up his mind,something in him must die, and that of necessity, and without his beingable to escape the fact; that he was entering a sepulchre on the righthand as much as on the left; that he was passing through a death agony,&mdash;theagony of his happiness, or the agony of his virtue.</p><p>Alas! all his resolution had again taken possession of him. He was nofurther advanced than at the beginning.</p><p>Thus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish. Eighteen hundred yearsbefore this unfortunate man, the mysterious Being in whom are summed upall the sanctities and all the sufferings of humanity had also long thrustaside with his hand, while the olive-trees quivered in the wild wind ofthe infinite, the terrible cup which appeared to Him dripping withdarkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all studded withstars.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0058" id="link2HCH0058"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;FORMS ASSUMED BY SUFFERING DURING SLEEP</h3><p>Three o&rsquo;clock in the morning had just struck, and he had been walking thusfor five hours, almost uninterruptedly, when he at length allowed himselfto drop into his chair.</p><p>There he fell asleep and had a dream.</p><p>This dream, like the majority of dreams, bore no relation to thesituation, except by its painful and heart-rending character, but it madean impression on him. This nightmare struck him so forcibly that he wroteit down later on. It is one of the papers in his own handwriting which hehas bequeathed to us. We think that we have here reproduced the thing instrict accordance with the text.</p><p>Of whatever nature this dream may be, the history of this night would beincomplete if we were to omit it: it is the gloomy adventure of an ailingsoul.</p><p>Here it is. On the envelope we find this line inscribed, &ldquo;The Dream I hadthat Night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was in a plain; a vast, gloomy plain, where there was no grass. It didnot seem to me to be daylight nor yet night.</p><p>&ldquo;I was walking with my brother, the brother of my childish years, thebrother of whom, I must say, I never think, and whom I now hardlyremember.</p><p>&ldquo;We were conversing and we met some passers-by. We were talking of aneighbor of ours in former days, who had always worked with her windowopen from the time when she came to live on the street. As we talked wefelt cold because of that open window.</p><p>&ldquo;There were no trees in the plain. We saw a man passing close to us. Hewas entirely nude, of the hue of ashes, and mounted on a horse which wasearth color. The man had no hair; we could see his skull and the veins onit. In his hand he held a switch which was as supple as a vine-shoot andas heavy as iron. This horseman passed and said nothing to us.</p><p>&ldquo;My brother said to me, &lsquo;Let us take to the hollow road.&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There existed a hollow way wherein one saw neither a single shrub nor aspear of moss. Everything was dirt-colored, even the sky. After proceedinga few paces, I received no reply when I spoke: I perceived that my brotherwas no longer with me.</p><p>&ldquo;I entered a village which I espied. I reflected that it must beRomainville. (Why Romainville?)<a href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5" id="linknoteref-5">5</a></p><p>&ldquo;The first street that I entered was deserted. I entered a second street.Behind the angle formed by the two streets, a man was standing erectagainst the wall. I said to this man:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What country is this? Where am I?&rsquo; The man made no reply. Isaw the door of a house open, and I entered.</p><p>&ldquo;The first chamber was deserted. I entered the second. Behind the door ofthis chamber a man was standing erect against the wall. I inquired of thisman, &lsquo;Whose house is this? Where am I?&rsquo; The man replied not.</p><p>&ldquo;The house had a garden. I quitted the house and entered the garden. Thegarden was deserted. Behind the first tree I found a man standing upright.I said to this man, &lsquo;What garden is this? Where am I?&rsquo; The man did notanswer.</p><p>&ldquo;I strolled into the village, and perceived that it was a town. All thestreets were deserted, all the doors were open. Not a single living beingwas passing in the streets, walking through the chambers or strolling inthe gardens. But behind each angle of the walls, behind each door, behindeach tree, stood a silent man. Only one was to be seen at a time. Thesemen watched me pass.</p><p>&ldquo;I left the town and began to ramble about the fields.</p><p>&ldquo;After the lapse of some time I turned back and saw a great crowd comingup behind me. I recognized all the men whom I had seen in that town. Theyhad strange heads. They did not seem to be in a hurry, yet they walkedfaster than I did. They made no noise as they walked. In an instant thiscrowd had overtaken and surrounded me. The faces of these men were earthenin hue.</p><p>&ldquo;Then the first one whom I had seen and questioned on entering the townsaid to me:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Whither are you going! Do you not know that you have been dead this longtime?&rsquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I opened my mouth to reply, and I perceived that there was no one nearme.&rdquo;</p><p>He woke. He was icy cold. A wind which was chill like the breeze of dawnwas rattling the leaves of the window, which had been left open on theirhinges. The fire was out. The candle was nearing its end. It was stillblack night.</p><p>He rose, he went to the window. There were no stars in the sky even yet.</p><p>From his window the yard of the house and the street were visible. Asharp, harsh noise, which made him drop his eyes, resounded from theearth.</p><p>Below him he perceived two red stars, whose rays lengthened and shortenedin a singular manner through the darkness.</p><p>As his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep, &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there are no stars in the sky. They are on earth now.&rdquo;</p><p>But this confusion vanished; a second sound similar to the first rousedhim thoroughly; he looked and recognized the fact that these two starswere the lanterns of a carriage. By the light which they cast he was ableto distinguish the form of this vehicle. It was a tilbury harnessed to asmall white horse. The noise which he had heard was the trampling of thehorse&rsquo;s hoofs on the pavement.</p><p>&ldquo;What vehicle is this?&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Who is coming here so earlyin the morning?&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber.</p><p>He shuddered from head to foot, and cried in a terrible voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;</p><p>Some one said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I, Monsieur le Maire.&rdquo;</p><p>He recognized the voice of the old woman who was his portress.</p><p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Maire, it is just five o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is that to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The cabriolet is here, Monsieur le Maire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What cabriolet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The tilbury.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What tilbury?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did not Monsieur le Maire order a tilbury?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;The coachman says that he has come for Monsieur le Maire.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What coachman?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;M. Scaufflaire&rsquo;s coachman.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;M. Scaufflaire?&rdquo;</p><p>That name sent a shudder over him, as though a flash of lightning hadpassed in front of his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! yes,&rdquo; he resumed; &ldquo;M. Scaufflaire!&rdquo;</p><p>If the old woman could have seen him at that moment, she would have beenfrightened.</p><p>A tolerably long silence ensued. He examined the flame of the candle witha stupid air, and from around the wick he took some of the burning wax,which he rolled between his fingers. The old woman waited for him. Sheeven ventured to uplift her voice once more:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What am I to say, Monsieur le Maire?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say that it is well, and that I am coming down.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0059" id="link2HCH0059"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;HINDRANCES</h3><p>The posting service from Arras to M. sur M. was still operated at thisperiod by small mail-wagons of the time of the Empire. These mail-wagonswere two-wheeled cabriolets, upholstered inside with fawn-colored leather,hung on springs, and having but two seats, one for the postboy, the otherfor the traveller. The wheels were armed with those long, offensive axleswhich keep other vehicles at a distance, and which may still be seen onthe road in Germany. The despatch box, an immense oblong coffer, wasplaced behind the vehicle and formed a part of it. This coffer was paintedblack, and the cabriolet yellow.</p><p>These vehicles, which have no counterparts nowadays, had somethingdistorted and hunchbacked about them; and when one saw them passing in thedistance, and climbing up some road to the horizon, they resembled theinsects which are called, I think, termites, and which, though with butlittle corselet, drag a great train behind them. But they travelled at avery rapid rate. The post-wagon which set out from Arras at one o&rsquo;clockevery night, after the mail from Paris had passed, arrived at M. sur M. alittle before five o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p><p>That night the wagon which was descending to M. sur M. by the Hesdin road,collided at the corner of a street, just as it was entering the town, witha little tilbury harnessed to a white horse, which was going in theopposite direction, and in which there was but one person, a man envelopedin a mantle. The wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent shock. Thepostman shouted to the man to stop, but the traveller paid no heed andpursued his road at full gallop.</p><p>&ldquo;That man is in a devilish hurry!&rdquo; said the postman.</p><p>The man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling inconvulsions which are certainly deserving of pity.</p><p>Whither was he going? He could not have told. Why was he hastening? He didnot know. He was driving at random, straight ahead. Whither? To Arras, nodoubt; but he might have been going elsewhere as well. At times he wasconscious of it, and he shuddered. He plunged into the night as into agulf. Something urged him forward; something drew him on. No one couldhave told what was taking place within him; every one will understand it.What man is there who has not entered, at least once in his life, intothat obscure cavern of the unknown?</p><p>However, he had resolved on nothing, decided nothing, formed no plan, donenothing. None of the actions of his conscience had been decisive. He was,more than ever, as he had been at the first moment.</p><p>Why was he going to Arras?</p><p>He repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hiredScaufflaire&rsquo;s cabriolet: that, whatever the result was to be, there was noreason why he should not see with his own eyes, and judge of matters forhimself; that this was even prudent; that he must know what took place;that no decision could be arrived at without having observed andscrutinized; that one made mountains out of everything from a distance;that, at any rate, when he should have seen that Champmathieu, somewretch, his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow him togo to the galleys in his stead; that Javert would indeed be there; andthat Brevet, that Chenildieu, that Cochepaille, old convicts who had knownhim; but they certainly would not recognize him;&mdash;bah! what an idea!that Javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth; that allconjectures and all suppositions were fixed on Champmathieu, and thatthere is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures; thataccordingly there was no danger.</p><p>That it was, no doubt, a dark moment, but that he should emerge from it;that, after all, he held his destiny, however bad it might be, in his ownhand; that he was master of it. He clung to this thought.</p><p>At bottom, to tell the whole truth, he would have preferred not to go toArras.</p><p>Nevertheless, he was going thither.</p><p>As he meditated, he whipped up his horse, which was proceeding at thatfine, regular, and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a half anhour.</p><p>In proportion as the cabriolet advanced, he felt something within him drawback.</p><p>At daybreak he was in the open country; the town of M. sur M. lay farbehind him. He watched the horizon grow white; he stared at all the chillyfigures of a winter&rsquo;s dawn as they passed before his eyes, but withoutseeing them. The morning has its spectres as well as the evening. He didnot see them; but without his being aware of it, and by means of a sort ofpenetration which was almost physical, these black silhouettes of treesand of hills added some gloomy and sinister quality to the violent stateof his soul.</p><p>Each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimesborder on the highway, he said to himself, &ldquo;And yet there are people therewithin who are sleeping!&rdquo;</p><p>The trot of the horse, the bells on the harness, the wheels on the road,produced a gentle, monotonous noise. These things are charming when one isjoyous, and lugubrious when one is sad.</p><p>It was broad daylight when he arrived at Hesdin. He halted in front of theinn, to allow the horse a breathing spell, and to have him given someoats.</p><p>The horse belonged, as Scaufflaire had said, to that small race of theBoulonnais, which has too much head, too much belly, and not enough neckand shoulders, but which has a broad chest, a large crupper, thin, finelegs, and solid hoofs&mdash;a homely, but a robust and healthy race. Theexcellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours, and had not adrop of sweat on his loins.</p><p>He did not get out of the tilbury. The stableman who brought the oatssuddenly bent down and examined the left wheel.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going far in this condition?&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>He replied, with an air of not having roused himself from his reverie:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you come from a great distance?&rdquo; went on the man.</p><p>&ldquo;Five leagues.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you say, &lsquo;Ah?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The man bent down once more, was silent for a moment, with his eyes fixedon the wheel; then he rose erect and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Because, though this wheel has travelled five leagues, it certainly willnot travel another quarter of a league.&rdquo;</p><p>He sprang out of the tilbury.</p><p>&ldquo;What is that you say, my friend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagueswithout you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway. Justsee here!&rdquo;</p><p>The wheel really had suffered serious damage. The shock administered bythe mail-wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub, so that the nutno longer held firm.</p><p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said to the stableman, &ldquo;is there a wheelwright here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do me the service to go and fetch him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is only a step from here. Hey! Master Bourgaillard!&rdquo;</p><p>Master Bourgaillard, the wheelwright, was standing on his own threshold.He came, examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when thelatter thinks a limb is broken.</p><p>&ldquo;Can you repair this wheel immediately?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When can I set out again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is a long day&rsquo;s work on it. Are you in a hurry, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In a very great hurry. I must set out again in an hour at the latest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Impossible, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will pay whatever you ask.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, in two hours, then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Impossible to-day. Two new spokes and a hub must be made. Monsieur willnot be able to start before to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The matter cannot wait until to-morrow. What if you were to replace thiswheel instead of repairing it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are a wheelwright?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you not a wheel that you can sell me? Then I could start again atonce.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A spare wheel?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet. Two wheels make apair. Two wheels cannot be put together hap-hazard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case, sell me a pair of wheels.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not all wheels fit all axles, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Try, nevertheless.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is useless, sir. I have nothing to sell but cart-wheels. We are but apoor country here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have?&rdquo;</p><p>The wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a hiredvehicle. He shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;You treat the cabriolets that people let you so well! If I had one, Iwould not let it to you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, sell it to me, then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have none.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! not even a spring-cart? I am not hard to please, as you see.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We live in a poor country. There is, in truth,&rdquo; added the wheelwright,&ldquo;an old calash under the shed yonder, which belongs to a bourgeois of thetown, who gave it to me to take care of, and who only uses it on thethirty-sixth of the month&mdash;never, that is to say. I might let that toyou, for what matters it to me? But the bourgeois must not see it pass&mdash;andthen, it is a calash; it would require two horses.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will take two post-horses.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is Monsieur going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To Arras.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And Monsieur wishes to reach there to-day?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By taking two post-horses?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does it make any difference whether Monsieur arrives at four o&rsquo;clockto-morrow morning?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is one thing to be said about that, you see, by taking post-horses&mdash;Monsieurhas his passport?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, by taking post-horses, Monsieur cannot reach Arras beforeto-morrow. We are on a crossroad. The relays are badly served, the horsesare in the fields. The season for ploughing is just beginning; heavy teamsare required, and horses are seized upon everywhere, from the post as wellas elsewhere. Monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the leastat every relay. And, then, they drive at a walk. There are many hills toascend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come then, I will go on horseback. Unharness the cabriolet. Some one cansurely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Without doubt. But will this horse bear the saddle?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true; you remind me of that; he will not bear it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I can surely hire a horse in the village?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A horse to travel to Arras at one stretch?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts. Youwould have to buy it to begin with, because no one knows you. But you willnot find one for sale nor to let, for five hundred francs, or for athousand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man, and setout on your journey to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To-morrow will be too late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there not a mail-wagon which runs to Arras? When will it pass?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To-night. Both the posts pass at night; the one going as well as the onecoming.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! It will take you a day to mend this wheel?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A day, and a good long one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you set two men to work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If I set ten men to work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That could be done with the spokes, not with the hub; and the felly is ina bad state, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there any one in this village who lets out teams?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there another wheelwright?&rdquo;</p><p>The stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert, with a toss of thehead.</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>He felt an immense joy.</p><p>It was evident that Providence was intervening. That it was it who hadbroken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road. Hehad not yielded to this sort of first summons; he had just made everypossible effort to continue the journey; he had loyally and scrupulouslyexhausted all means; he had been deterred neither by the season, norfatigue, nor by the expense; he had nothing with which to reproachhimself. If he went no further, that was no fault of his. It did notconcern him further. It was no longer his fault. It was not the act of hisown conscience, but the act of Providence.</p><p>He breathed again. He breathed freely and to the full extent of his lungsfor the first time since Javert&rsquo;s visit. It seemed to him that the hand ofiron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty hours hadjust released him.</p><p>It seemed to him that God was for him now, and was manifesting Himself.</p><p>He said to himself that he had done all he could, and that now he had nothingto do but retrace his steps quietly.</p><p>If his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber ofthe inn, it would have had no witnesses, no one would have heard him,things would have rested there, and it is probable that we should not havehad to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about to peruse;but this conversation had taken place in the street. Any colloquy in thestreet inevitably attracts a crowd. There are always people who asknothing better than to become spectators. While he was questioning thewheelwright, some people who were passing back and forth halted aroundthem. After listening for a few minutes, a young lad, to whom no one hadpaid any heed, detached himself from the group and ran off.</p><p>At the moment when the traveller, after the inward deliberation which wehave just described, resolved to retrace his steps, this child returned.He was accompanied by an old woman.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;my boy tells me that you wish to hire acabriolet.&rdquo;</p><p>These simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made theperspiration trickle down his limbs. He thought that he beheld the handwhich had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him, ready toseize him once more.</p><p>He answered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my good woman; I am in search of a cabriolet which I can hire.&rdquo;</p><p>And he hastened to add:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;But there is none in the place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly there is,&rdquo; said the old woman.</p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; interpolated the wheelwright.</p><p>&ldquo;At my house,&rdquo; replied the old woman.</p><p>He shuddered. The fatal hand had grasped him again.</p><p>The old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring-cart. Thewheelwright and the stable-man, in despair at the prospect of thetraveller escaping their clutches, interfered.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a frightful old trap; it rests flat on the axle; it is an actualfact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs; the raincame into it; the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture; it would notgo much further than the tilbury; a regular ramshackle old stage-wagon;the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted himself to it,&rdquo; etc., etc.</p><p>All this was true; but this trap, this ramshackle old vehicle, this thing,whatever it was, ran on its two wheels and could go to Arras.</p><p>He paid what was asked, left the tilbury with the wheelwright to berepaired, intending to reclaim it on his return, had the white horse putto the cart, climbed into it, and resumed the road which he had beentravelling since morning.</p><p>At the moment when the cart moved off, he admitted that he had felt, amoment previously, a certain joy in the thought that he should not gowhither he was now proceeding. He examined this joy with a sort of wrath,and found it absurd. Why should he feel joy at turning back? After all, hewas taking this trip of his own free will. No one was forcing him to it.</p><p>And assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose.</p><p>As he left Hesdin, he heard a voice shouting to him: &ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; Hehalted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish andconvulsive element resembling hope.</p><p>It was the old woman&rsquo;s little boy.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;it was I who got the cart for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have not given me anything.&rdquo;</p><p>He who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almostodious.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s you, you scamp?&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you shall have nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>He whipped up his horse and set off at full speed.</p><p>He had lost a great deal of time at Hesdin. He wanted to make it good. Thelittle horse was courageous, and pulled for two; but it was the month ofFebruary, there had been rain; the roads were bad. And then, it was nolonger the tilbury. The cart was very heavy, and in addition, there weremany ascents.</p><p>He took nearly four hours to go from Hesdin to Saint-Pol; four hours forfive leagues.</p><p>At Saint-Pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to andled to the stable; as he had promised Scaufflaire, he stood beside themanger while the horse was eating; he thought of sad and confusing things.</p><p>The inn-keeper&rsquo;s wife came to the stable.</p><p>&ldquo;Does not Monsieur wish to breakfast?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come, that is true; I even have a good appetite.&rdquo;</p><p>He followed the woman, who had a rosy, cheerful face; she led him to thepublic room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth.</p><p>&ldquo;Make haste!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I must start again; I am in a hurry.&rdquo;</p><p>A big Flemish servant-maid placed his knife and fork in all haste; helooked at the girl with a sensation of comfort.</p><p>&ldquo;That is what ailed me,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;I had not breakfasted.&rdquo;</p><p>His breakfast was served; he seized the bread, took a mouthful, and thenslowly replaced it on the table, and did not touch it again.</p><p>A carter was eating at another table; he said to this man:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Why is their bread so bitter here?&rdquo;</p><p>The carter was a German and did not understand him.</p><p>He returned to the stable and remained near the horse.</p><p>An hour later he had quitted Saint-Pol and was directing his coursetowards Tinques, which is only five leagues from Arras.</p><p>What did he do during this journey? Of what was he thinking? As in themorning, he watched the trees, the thatched roofs, the tilled fields passby, and the way in which the landscape, broken at every turn of the road,vanished; this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to thesoul, and almost relieves it from thought. What is more melancholy andmore profound than to see a thousand objects for the first and the lasttime? To travel is to be born and to die at every instant; perhaps, in thevaguest region of his mind, he did make comparisons between the shiftinghorizon and our human existence: all the things of life are perpetuallyfleeing before us; the dark and bright intervals are intermingled; after adazzling moment, an eclipse; we look, we hasten, we stretch out our handsto grasp what is passing; each event is a turn in the road, and, all atonce, we are old; we feel a shock; all is black; we distinguish an obscuredoor; the gloomy horse of life, which has been drawing us halts, and wesee a veiled and unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows.</p><p>Twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of schoolbeheld this traveller enter Tinques; it is true that the days were stillshort; he did not halt at Tinques; as he emerged from the village, alaborer, who was mending the road with stones, raised his head and said tohim:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That horse is very much fatigued.&rdquo;</p><p>The poor beast was, in fact, going at a walk.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to Arras?&rdquo; added the road-mender.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early.&rdquo;</p><p>He stopped his horse, and asked the laborer:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;How far is it from here to Arras?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nearly seven good leagues.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How is that? the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; returned the road-mender, &ldquo;so you don&rsquo;t know that the road is underrepair? You will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on; there isno way to proceed further.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will take the road on the left, leading to Carency; you will crossthe river; when you reach Camblin, you will turn to the right; that is theroad to Mont-Saint-Éloy which leads to Arras.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it is night, and I shall lose my way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do not belong in these parts?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And, besides, it is all crossroads; stop! sir,&rdquo; resumed the road-mender;&ldquo;shall I give you a piece of advice? your horse is tired; return toTinques; there is a good inn there; sleep there; you can reach Arrasto-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I must be there this evening.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is different; but go to the inn all the same, and get an extrahorse; the stable-boy will guide you through the crossroads.&rdquo;</p><p>He followed the road-mender&rsquo;s advice, retraced his steps, and, half anhour later, he passed the same spot again, but this time at full speed,with a good horse to aid; a stable-boy, who called himself a postilion,was seated on the shaft of the cariole.</p><p>Still, he felt that he had lost time.</p><p>Night had fully come.</p><p>They turned into the crossroad; the way became frightfully bad; the cartlurched from one rut to the other; he said to the postilion:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Keep at a trot, and you shall have a double fee.&rdquo;</p><p>In one of the jolts, the whiffle-tree broke.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the whiffle-tree broken, sir,&rdquo; said the postilion; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t knowhow to harness my horse now; this road is very bad at night; if you wishto return and sleep at Tinques, we could be in Arras early to-morrowmorning.&rdquo;</p><p>He replied, &ldquo;Have you a bit of rope and a knife?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>He cut a branch from a tree and made a whiffle-tree of it.</p><p>This caused another loss of twenty minutes; but they set out again at agallop.</p><p>The plain was gloomy; low-hanging, black, crisp fogs crept over the hillsand wrenched themselves away like smoke: there were whitish gleams in theclouds; a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced a sound in allquarters of the horizon, as of some one moving furniture; everything thatcould be seen assumed attitudes of terror. How many things shiver beneaththese vast breaths of the night!</p><p>He was stiff with cold; he had eaten nothing since the night before; hevaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in theneighborhood of D&mdash;&mdash;, eight years previously, and it seemed butyesterday.</p><p>The hour struck from a distant tower; he asked the boy:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seven o&rsquo;clock, sir; we shall reach Arras at eight; we have but threeleagues still to go.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, he for the first time indulged in this reflection,thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner: that allthis trouble which he was taking was, perhaps, useless; that he did notknow so much as the hour of the trial; that he should, at least, haveinformed himself of that; that he was foolish to go thus straight aheadwithout knowing whether he would be of any service or not; then hesketched out some calculations in his mind: that, ordinarily, the sittingsof the Court of Assizes began at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning; that itcould not be a long affair; that the theft of the apples would be verybrief; that there would then remain only a question of identity, four orfive depositions, and very little for the lawyers to say; that he shouldarrive after all was over.</p><p>The postilion whipped up the horses; they had crossed the river and leftMont-Saint-Éloy behind them.</p><p>The night grew more profound.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0060" id="link2HCH0060"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;SISTER SIMPLICE PUT TO THE PROOF</h3><p>But at that moment Fantine was joyous.</p><p>She had passed a very bad night; her cough was frightful; her fever haddoubled in intensity; she had had dreams: in the morning, when the doctorpaid his visit, she was delirious; he assumed an alarmed look, and orderedthat he should be informed as soon as M. Madeleine arrived.</p><p>All the morning she was melancholy, said but little, and laid plaits inher sheets, murmuring the while, in a low voice, calculations which seemedto be calculations of distances. Her eyes were hollow and staring. Theyseemed almost extinguished at intervals, then lighted up again and shonelike stars. It seems as though, at the approach of a certain dark hour,the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the light of earth.</p><p>Each time that Sister Simplice asked her how she felt, she repliedinvariably, &ldquo;Well. I should like to see M. Madeleine.&rdquo;</p><p>Some months before this, at the moment when Fantine had just lost her lastmodesty, her last shame, and her last joy, she was the shadow of herself;now she was the spectre of herself. Physical suffering had completed thework of moral suffering. This creature of five and twenty had a wrinkledbrow, flabby cheeks, pinched nostrils, teeth from which the gums hadreceded, a leaden complexion, a bony neck, prominent shoulder-blades,frail limbs, a clayey skin, and her golden hair was growing out sprinkledwith gray. Alas! how illness improvises old-age!</p><p>At midday the physician returned, gave some directions, inquired whetherthe mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary, and shook his head.</p><p>M. Madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three o&rsquo;clock. Asexactness is kindness, he was exact.</p><p>About half-past two, Fantine began to be restless. In the course of twentyminutes, she asked the nun more than ten times, &ldquo;What time is it, sister?&rdquo;</p><p>Three o&rsquo;clock struck. At the third stroke, Fantine sat up in bed; she whocould, in general, hardly turn over, joined her yellow, fleshless hands ina sort of convulsive clasp, and the nun heard her utter one of thoseprofound sighs which seem to throw off dejection. Then Fantine turned andlooked at the door.</p><p>No one entered; the door did not open.</p><p>She remained thus for a quarter of an hour, her eyes riveted on the door,motionless and apparently holding her breath. The sister dared not speakto her. The clock struck a quarter past three. Fantine fell back on herpillow.</p><p>She said nothing, but began to plait the sheets once more.</p><p>Half an hour passed, then an hour, no one came; every time the clockstruck, Fantine started up and looked towards the door, then fell backagain.</p><p>Her thought was clearly perceptible, but she uttered no name, she made nocomplaint, she blamed no one. But she coughed in a melancholy way. Onewould have said that something dark was descending upon her. She was lividand her lips were blue. She smiled now and then.</p><p>Five o&rsquo;clock struck. Then the sister heard her say, very low and gently,&ldquo;He is wrong not to come to-day, since I am going away to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>Sister Simplice herself was surprised at M. Madeleine&rsquo;s delay.</p><p>In the meantime, Fantine was staring at the tester of her bed. She seemedto be endeavoring to recall something. All at once she began to sing in avoice as feeble as a breath. The nun listened. This is what Fantine wassinging:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Lovely things we will buy<br/>As we stroll the faubourgs through.<br/>Roses are pink, corn-flowers are blue,<br/>I love my love, corn-flowers are blue.</p><p>&ldquo;Yestere&rsquo;en the Virgin Mary came near my stove, in a broidered mantleclad, and said to me, &lsquo;Here, hide &rsquo;neath my veil the child whom you oneday begged from me.

She sang it in so sad a voice, and to so sweet an air, that it wasenough to make any one, even a nun, weep. The sister, accustomed as shewas to austerities, felt a tear spring to her eyes.</p><p>The clock struck six. Fantine did not seem to hear it. She no longerseemed to pay attention to anything about her.</p><p>Sister Simplice sent a serving-maid to inquire of the portress of thefactory, whether the mayor had returned, and if he would not come to theinfirmary soon. The girl returned in a few minutes.</p><p>Fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts.</p><p>The servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone, that the mayorhad set out that morning before six o&rsquo;clock, in a little tilbury harnessedto a white horse, cold as the weather was; that he had gone alone, withouteven a driver; that no one knew what road he had taken; that people saidhe had been seen to turn into the road to Arras; that others asserted thatthey had met him on the road to Paris. That when he went away he had beenvery gentle, as usual, and that he had merely told the portress not toexpect him that night.</p><p>While the two women were whispering together, with their backs turned toFantine&rsquo;s bed, the sister interrogating, the servant conjecturing,Fantine, with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies, whichunite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of death,had raised herself to her knees in bed, with her shrivelled hands restingon the bolster, and her head thrust through the opening of the curtains,and was listening. All at once she cried:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You are speaking of M. Madeleine! Why are you talking so low? What is hedoing? Why does he not come?&rdquo;</p><p>Her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heardthe voice of a man; they wheeled round in affright.</p><p>&ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo; cried Fantine.</p><p>The servant stammered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The portress told me that he could not come to-day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be calm, my child,&rdquo; said the sister; &ldquo;lie down again.&rdquo;</p><p>Fantine, without changing her attitude, continued in a loud voice, andwith an accent that was both imperious and heart-rending:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;He cannot come? Why not? You know the reason. You are whispering it toeach other there. I want to know it.&rdquo;</p><p>The servant-maid hastened to say in the nun&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;Say that he is busywith the city council.&rdquo;</p><p>Sister Simplice blushed faintly, for it was a lie that the maid hadproposed to her.</p><p>On the other hand, it seemed to her that the mere communication of thetruth to the invalid would, without doubt, deal her a terrible blow, andthat this was a serious matter in Fantine&rsquo;s present state. Her flush didnot last long; the sister raised her calm, sad eyes to Fantine, and said,&ldquo;Monsieur le Maire has gone away.&rdquo;</p><p>Fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed: her eyessparkled; indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face.</p><p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;he has gone to get Cosette.&rdquo;</p><p>Then she raised her arms to heaven, and her white face became ineffable;her lips moved; she was praying in a low voice.</p><p>When her prayer was finished, &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am willing to liedown again; I will do anything you wish; I was naughty just now; I begyour pardon for having spoken so loud; it is very wrong to talk loudly; Iknow that well, my good sister, but, you see, I am very happy: the goodGod is good; M. Madeleine is good; just think! he has gone to Montfermeilto get my little Cosette.&rdquo;</p><p>She lay down again, with the nun&rsquo;s assistance, helped the nun to arrangeher pillow, and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her neck,and which Sister Simplice had given her.</p><p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said the sister, &ldquo;try to rest now, and do not talk any more.&rdquo;</p><p>Fantine took the sister&rsquo;s hand in her moist hands, and the latter waspained to feel that perspiration.</p><p>&ldquo;He set out this morning for Paris; in fact, he need not even go throughParis; Montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence. Do youremember how he said to me yesterday, when I spoke to him of Cosette, <i>Soon,soon?</i> He wants to give me a surprise, you know! he made me sign aletter so that she could be taken from the Thénardiers; they cannot sayanything, can they? they will give back Cosette, for they have been paid;the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they havereceived their pay. Do not make signs to me that I must not talk, sister!I am extremely happy; I am doing well; I am not ill at all any more; I amgoing to see Cosette again; I am even quite hungry; it is nearly fiveyears since I saw her last; you cannot imagine how much attached one getsto children, and then, she will be so pretty; you will see! If you onlyknew what pretty little rosy fingers she had! In the first place, she willhave very beautiful hands; she had ridiculous hands when she was only ayear old; like this! she must be a big girl now; she is seven years old;she is quite a young lady; I call her Cosette, but her name is reallyEuphrasie. Stop! this morning I was looking at the dust on thechimney-piece, and I had a sort of idea come across me, like that, that Ishould see Cosette again soon. Mon Dieu! how wrong it is not to see one&rsquo;schildren for years! One ought to reflect that life is not eternal. Oh, howgood M. le Maire is to go! it is very cold! it is true; he had on hiscloak, at least? he will be here to-morrow, will he not? to-morrow will bea festival day; to-morrow morning, sister, you must remind me to put on mylittle cap that has lace on it. What a place that Montfermeil is! I tookthat journey on foot once; it was very long for me, but the diligences govery quickly! he will be here to-morrow with Cosette: how far is it fromhere to Montfermeil?&rdquo;</p><p>The sister, who had no idea of distances, replied, &ldquo;Oh, I think that hewill be here to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To-morrow! to-morrow!&rdquo; said Fantine, &ldquo;I shall see Cosette to-morrow! yousee, good sister of the good God, that I am no longer ill; I am mad; Icould dance if any one wished it.&rdquo;</p><p>A person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not haveunderstood the change; she was all rosy now; she spoke in a lively andnatural voice; her whole face was one smile; now and then she talked, shelaughed softly; the joy of a mother is almost infantile.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed the nun, &ldquo;now that you are happy, mind me, and do not talkany more.&rdquo;</p><p>Fantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice: &ldquo;Yes, liedown again; be good, for you are going to have your child; Sister Simpliceis right; every one here is right.&rdquo;</p><p>And then, without stirring, without even moving her head, she began tostare all about her with wide-open eyes and a joyous air, and she saidnothing more.</p><p>The sister drew the curtains together again, hoping that she would fallinto a doze. Between seven and eight o&rsquo;clock the doctor came; not hearingany sound, he thought Fantine was asleep, entered softly, and approachedthe bed on tiptoe; he opened the curtains a little, and, by the light ofthe taper, he saw Fantine&rsquo;s big eyes gazing at him.</p><p>She said to him, &ldquo;She will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little bed,will she not, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor thought that she was delirious. She added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;See! there is just room.&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor took Sister Simplice aside, and she explained matters to him;that M. Madeleine was absent for a day or two, and that in their doubtthey had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid, who believed thatthe mayor had gone to Montfermeil; that it was possible, after all, thather guess was correct: the doctor approved.</p><p>He returned to Fantine&rsquo;s bed, and she went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You see, when she wakes up in the morning, I shall be able to say goodmorning to her, poor kitten, and when I cannot sleep at night, I can hearher asleep; her little gentle breathing will do me good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give me your hand,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p><p>She stretched out her arm, and exclaimed with a laugh:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, hold! in truth, you did not know it; I am cured; Cosette will arriveto-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor was surprised; she was better; the pressure on her chest haddecreased; her pulse had regained its strength; a sort of life hadsuddenly supervened and reanimated this poor, worn-out creature.</p><p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;did the sister tell you that M. le Maire has goneto get that mite of a child?&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor recommended silence, and that all painful emotions should beavoided; he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona, and, in case thefever should increase again during the night, a calming potion. As he tookhis departure, he said to the sister:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;She is doing better; if good luck willed that the mayor should actuallyarrive to-morrow with the child, who knows? there are crises soastounding; great joy has been known to arrest maladies; I know well thatthis is an organic disease, and in an advanced state, but all those thingsare such mysteries: we may be able to save her.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0061" id="link2HCH0061"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE TRAVELLER ON HIS ARRIVAL TAKES PRECAUTIONS FORDEPARTURE</h3><p>It was nearly eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening when the cart, which we left onthe road, entered the porte-cochère of the Hotel de la Poste in Arras; theman whom we have been following up to this moment alighted from it,responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the people of theinn, sent back the extra horse, and with his own hands led the littlewhite horse to the stable; then he opened the door of a billiard-roomwhich was situated on the ground floor, sat down there, and leaned hiselbows on a table; he had taken fourteen hours for the journey which hehad counted on making in six; he did himself the justice to acknowledgethat it was not his fault, but at bottom, he was not sorry.</p><p>The landlady of the hotel entered.</p><p>&ldquo;Does Monsieur wish a bed?

A citizen was passing along with alantern. After some hesitation, he decided to apply to this man, notwithout having first glanced behind and in front of him, as though hefeared lest some one should hear the question which he was about to put.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;where is the court-house, if you please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You do not belong in town, sir?&rdquo; replied the bourgeois, who was an oldishman; &ldquo;well, follow me. I happen to be going in the direction of thecourt-house, that is to say, in the direction of the hotel of theprefecture; for the court-house is undergoing repairs just at this moment,and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in theprefecture.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it there that the Assizes are held?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir; you see, the prefecture of to-day was the bishop&rsquo;s palacebefore the Revolution. M. de Conzié, who was bishop in &rsquo;82, built a grandhall there. It is in this grand hall that the court is held.&rdquo;</p><p>On the way, the bourgeois said to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;If Monsieur desires to witness a case, it is rather late. The sittingsgenerally close at six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p><p>When they arrived on the grand square, however, the man pointed out to himfour long windows all lighted up, in the front of a vast and gloomybuilding.</p><p>&ldquo;Upon my word, sir, you are in luck; you have arrived in season. Do yousee those four windows? That is the Court of Assizes. There is lightthere, so they are not through. The matter must have been greatlyprotracted, and they are holding an evening session. Do you take aninterest in this affair? Is it a criminal case? Are you a witness?&rdquo;</p><p>He replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have not come on any business; I only wish to speak to one of thelawyers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is different,&rdquo; said the bourgeois. &ldquo;Stop, sir; here is the doorwhere the sentry stands. You have only to ascend the grand staircase.&rdquo;</p><p>He conformed to the bourgeois&rsquo;s directions, and a few minutes later he wasin a hall containing many people, and where groups, intermingled withlawyers in their gowns, were whispering together here and there.</p><p>It is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations of menrobed in black, murmuring together in low voices, on the threshold of thehalls of justice. It is rare that charity and pity are the outcome ofthese words. Condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to be theresult. All these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observer somany sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts ofdark edifices.</p><p>This spacious hall, illuminated by a single lamp, was the old hall of theepiscopal palace, and served as the large hall of the palace of justice. Adouble-leaved door, which was closed at that moment, separated it from thelarge apartment where the court was sitting.</p><p>The obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyerwhom he met.</p><p>&ldquo;What stage have they reached, sir?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;It is finished,&rdquo; said the lawyer.</p><p>&ldquo;Finished!&rdquo;</p><p>This word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me sir; perhaps you are a relative?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No; I know no one here. Has judgment been pronounced?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course. Nothing else was possible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To penal servitude?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For life.&rdquo;</p><p>He continued, in a voice so weak that it was barely audible:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Then his identity was established?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What identity?&rdquo; replied the lawyer. &ldquo;There was no identity to beestablished. The matter was very simple. The woman had murdered her child;the infanticide was proved; the jury threw out the question ofpremeditation, and she was condemned for life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So it was a woman?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, certainly. The Limosin woman. Of what are you speaking?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing. But since it is all over, how comes it that the hall is stilllighted?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For another case, which was begun about two hours ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What other case?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! this one is a clear case also. It is about a sort of blackguard; aman arrested for a second offence; a convict who has been guilty of theft.I don&rsquo;t know his name exactly. There&rsquo;s a bandit&rsquo;s phiz for you! I&rsquo;d sendhim to the galleys on the strength of his face alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there any way of getting into the court-room, sir?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;I really think that there is not. There is a great crowd. However, thehearing has been suspended. Some people have gone out, and when thehearing is resumed, you might make an effort.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is the entrance?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Through yonder large door.&rdquo;</p><p>The lawyer left him. In the course of a few moments he had experienced,almost simultaneously, almost intermingled with each other, all possibleemotions. The words of this indifferent spectator had, in turn, piercedhis heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire. When he saw thatnothing was settled, he breathed freely once more; but he could not havetold whether what he felt was pain or pleasure.</p><p>He drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying. Thedocket of the session was very heavy; the president had appointed for thesame day two short and simple cases. They had begun with the infanticide,and now they had reached the convict, the old offender, the &ldquo;returnhorse.&rdquo; This man had stolen apples, but that did not appear to be entirelyproved; what had been proved was, that he had already been in the galleysat Toulon. It was that which lent a bad aspect to his case. However, theman&rsquo;s examination and the depositions of the witnesses had been completed,but the lawyer&rsquo;s plea, and the speech of the public prosecutor were stillto come; it could not be finished before midnight. The man would probablybe condemned; the attorney-general was very clever, and never <i>missed</i>his culprits; he was a brilliant fellow who wrote verses.</p><p>An usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the Assizes. Heinquired of this usher:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Will the door be opened soon, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will not be opened at all,&rdquo; replied the usher.</p><p>&ldquo;What! It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed? Is not thehearing suspended?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The hearing has just been begun again,&rdquo; replied the usher, &ldquo;but the doorwill not be opened again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because the hall is full.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! There is not room for one more?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not another one. The door is closed. No one can enter now.&rdquo;</p><p>The usher added after a pause: &ldquo;There are, to tell the truth, two or threeextra places behind Monsieur le Président, but Monsieur le Président onlyadmits public functionaries to them.&rdquo;</p><p>So saying, the usher turned his back.</p><p>He retired with bowed head, traversed the antechamber, and slowlydescended the stairs, as though hesitating at every step. It is probablethat he was holding counsel with himself. The violent conflict which hadbeen going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended;and every moment he encountered some new phase of it. On reaching thelanding-place, he leaned his back against the balusters and folded hisarms. All at once he opened his coat, drew out his pocket-book, took fromit a pencil, tore out a leaf, and upon that leaf he wrote rapidly, by thelight of the street lantern, this line: <i>M. Madeleine, Mayor of M. surM.</i>; then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides, made hisway through the crowd, walked straight up to the usher, handed him thepaper, and said in an authoritative manner:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Take this to Monsieur le Président.&rdquo;</p><p>The usher took the paper, cast a glance upon it, and obeyed.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0062" id="link2HCH0062"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;AN ENTRANCE BY FAVOR</h3><p>Although he did not suspect the fact, the mayor of M. sur M. enjoyed asort of celebrity. For the space of seven years his reputation for virtuehad filled the whole of Bas Boulonnais; it had eventually passed theconfines of a small district and had been spread abroad through two orthree neighboring departments. Besides the service which he had renderedto the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry, there was notone out of the hundred and forty communes of the arrondissement of M. surM. which was not indebted to him for some benefit. He had even at needcontrived to aid and multiply the industries of other arrondissements. Itwas thus that he had, when occasion offered, supported with his credit andhis funds the linen factory at Boulogne, the flax-spinning industry atFrévent, and the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at Boubers-sur-Canche.Everywhere the name of M. Madeleine was pronounced with veneration. Arrasand Douai envied the happy little town of M. sur M. its mayor.</p><p>The Councillor of the Royal Court of Douai, who was presiding over thissession of the Assizes at Arras, was acquainted, in common with the restof the world, with this name which was so profoundly and universallyhonored. When the usher, discreetly opening the door which connected thecouncil-chamber with the court-room, bent over the back of the President&rsquo;sarmchair and handed him the paper on which was inscribed the line whichwe have just perused, adding: &ldquo;The gentleman desires to be present at thetrial,&rdquo; the President, with a quick and deferential movement, seized a penand wrote a few words at the bottom of the paper and returned it to theusher, saying, &ldquo;Admit him.&rdquo;</p><p>The unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the doorof the hall, in the same place and the same attitude in which the usherhad left him. In the midst of his reverie he heard some one saying to him,&ldquo;Will Monsieur do me the honor to follow me?&rdquo; It was the same usher whohad turned his back upon him but a moment previously, and who was nowbowing to the earth before him. At the same time, the usher handed him thepaper. He unfolded it, and as he chanced to be near the light, he couldread it.</p><p>&ldquo;The President of the Court of Assizes presents his respects to M.Madeleine.&rdquo;</p><p>He crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for him astrange and bitter aftertaste.</p><p>He followed the usher.</p><p>A few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted cabinetof severe aspect, lighted by two wax candles, placed upon a table with agreen cloth. The last words of the usher who had just quitted him stillrang in his ears: &ldquo;Monsieur, you are now in the council-chamber; you haveonly to turn the copper handle of yonder door, and you will find yourselfin the court-room, behind the President&rsquo;s chair.&rdquo; These words were mingledin his thoughts with a vague memory of narrow corridors and darkstaircases which he had recently traversed.</p><p>The usher had left him alone. The supreme moment had arrived. He sought tocollect his faculties, but could not. It is chiefly at the moment whenthere is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful realities oflife, that the threads of thought snap within the brain. He was in thevery place where the judges deliberated and condemned. With stupidtranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment, where somany lives had been broken, which was soon to ring with his name, andwhich his fate was at that moment traversing. He stared at the wall, thenhe looked at himself, wondering that it should be that chamber and that itshould be he.</p><p>He had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours; he was worn out by thejolts of the cart, but he was not conscious of it. It seemed to him thathe felt nothing.</p><p>He approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall, and whichcontained, under glass, an ancient autograph letter of Jean Nicolas Pache,mayor of Paris and minister, and dated, through an error, no doubt, the <i>9thof June</i>, of the year II., and in which Pache forwarded to the communethe list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them. Any spectatorwho had chanced to see him at that moment, and who had watched him, wouldhave imagined, doubtless, that this letter struck him as very curious, forhe did not take his eyes from it, and he read it two or three times. Heread it without paying any attention to it, and unconsciously. He wasthinking of Fantine and Cosette.</p><p>As he dreamed, he turned round, and his eyes fell upon the brass knob ofthe door which separated him from the Court of Assizes. He had almostforgotten that door. His glance, calm at first, paused there, remainedfixed on that brass handle, then grew terrified, and little by littlebecame impregnated with fear. Beads of perspiration burst forth among hishair and trickled down upon his temples.</p><p>At a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort ofauthority mingled with rebellion, which is intended to convey, and whichdoes so well convey, <i>&ldquo;Pardieu! who compels me to this?&rdquo;</i> Then hewheeled briskly round, caught sight of the door through which he hadentered in front of him, went to it, opened it, and passed out. He was nolonger in that chamber; he was outside in a corridor, a long, narrowcorridor, broken by steps and gratings, making all sorts of angles,lighted here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids,the corridor through which he had approached. He breathed, he listened;not a sound in front, not a sound behind him, and he fled as thoughpursued.</p><p>When he had turned many angles in this corridor, he still listened. Thesame silence reigned, and there was the same darkness around him. He wasout of breath; he staggered; he leaned against the wall. The stone wascold; the perspiration lay ice-cold on his brow; he straightened himselfup with a shiver.</p><p>Then, there alone in the darkness, trembling with cold and with somethingelse, too, perchance, he meditated.</p><p>He had meditated all night long; he had meditated all the day: he heardwithin him but one voice, which said, &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;</p><p>A quarter of an hour passed thus. At length he bowed his head, sighed withagony, dropped his arms, and retraced his steps. He walked slowly, and asthough crushed. It seemed as though some one had overtaken him in hisflight and was leading him back.</p><p>He re-entered the council-chamber. The first thing he caught sight of wasthe knob of the door. This knob, which was round and of polished brass,shone like a terrible star for him. He gazed at it as a lamb might gazeinto the eye of a tiger.</p><p>He could not take his eyes from it. From time to time he advanced a stepand approached the door.</p><p>Had he listened, he would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall likea sort of confused murmur; but he did not listen, and he did not hear.</p><p>Suddenly, without himself knowing how it happened, he found himself nearthe door; he grasped the knob convulsively; the door opened.</p><p>He was in the court-room.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0063" id="link2HCH0063"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;A PLACE WHERE CONVICTIONS ARE IN PROCESS OF FORMATION</h3><p>He advanced a pace, closed the door mechanically behind him, and remainedstanding, contemplating what he saw.</p><p>It was a vast and badly lighted apartment, now full of uproar, now full ofsilence, where all the apparatus of a criminal case, with its petty andmournful gravity in the midst of the throng, was in process ofdevelopment.</p><p>At the one end of the hall, the one where he was, were judges, withabstracted air, in threadbare robes, who were gnawing their nails orclosing their eyelids; at the other end, a ragged crowd; lawyers in allsorts of attitudes; soldiers with hard but honest faces; ancient, spottedwoodwork, a dirty ceiling, tables covered with serge that was yellowrather than green; doors blackened by handmarks; tap-room lamps whichemitted more smoke than light, suspended from nails in the wainscot; onthe tables candles in brass candlesticks; darkness, ugliness, sadness; andfrom all this there was disengaged an austere and august impression, forone there felt that grand human thing which is called the law, and thatgrand divine thing which is called justice.</p><p>No one in all that throng paid any attention to him; all glances weredirected towards a single point, a wooden bench placed against a smalldoor, in the stretch of wall on the President&rsquo;s left; on this bench,illuminated by several candles, sat a man between two gendarmes.</p><p>This man was <i>the</i> man.</p><p>He did not seek him; he saw him; his eyes went thither naturally, asthough they had known beforehand where that figure was.</p><p>He thought he was looking at himself, grown old; not absolutely the samein face, of course, but exactly similar in attitude and aspect, with hisbristling hair, with that wild and uneasy eye, with that blouse, just asit was on the day when he entered D&mdash;&mdash;, full of hatred,concealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which hehad spent nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison.</p><p>He said to himself with a shudder, &ldquo;Good God! shall I become like thatagain?&rdquo;</p><p>This creature seemed to be at least sixty; there was somethingindescribably coarse, stupid, and frightened about him.</p><p>At the sound made by the opening door, people had drawn aside to make wayfor him; the President had turned his head, and, understanding that thepersonage who had just entered was the mayor of M. sur M., he had bowed tohim; the attorney-general, who had seen M. Madeleine at M. sur M., whitherthe duties of his office had called him more than once, recognized him andsaluted him also: he had hardly perceived it; he was the victim of a sortof hallucination; he was watching.</p><p>Judges, clerks, gendarmes, a throng of cruelly curious heads, all these hehad already beheld once, in days gone by, twenty-seven years before; hehad encountered those fatal things once more; there they were; they moved;they existed; it was no longer an effort of his memory, a mirage of histhought; they were real gendarmes and real judges, a real crowd, and realmen of flesh and blood: it was all over; he beheld the monstrous aspectsof his past reappear and live once more around him, with all that there isformidable in reality.</p><p>All this was yawning before him.</p><p>He was horrified by it; he shut his eyes, and exclaimed in the deepestrecesses of his soul, &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p><p>And by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas tremble, andrendered him nearly mad, it was another self of his that was there! allcalled that man who was being tried Jean Valjean.</p><p>Under his very eyes, unheard-of vision, he had a sort of representation ofthe most horrible moment of his life, enacted by his spectre.</p><p>Everything was there; the apparatus was the same, the hour of the night,the faces of the judges, of soldiers, and of spectators; all were thesame, only above the President&rsquo;s head there hung a crucifix, somethingwhich the courts had lacked at the time of his condemnation: God had beenabsent when he had been judged.</p><p>There was a chair behind him; he dropped into it, terrified at the thoughtthat he might be seen; when he was seated, he took advantage of a pile ofcardboard boxes, which stood on the judge&rsquo;s desk, to conceal his face fromthe whole room; he could now see without being seen; he had fully regainedconsciousness of the reality of things; gradually he recovered; heattained that phase of composure where it is possible to listen.</p><p>M. Bamatabois was one of the jurors.</p><p>He looked for Javert, but did not see him; the seat of the witnesses washidden from him by the clerk&rsquo;s table, and then, as we have just said, thehall was sparely lighted.</p><p>At the moment of this entrance, the defendant&rsquo;s lawyer had just finishedhis plea.</p><p>The attention of all was excited to the highest pitch; the affair hadlasted for three hours: for three hours that crowd had been watching astrange man, a miserable specimen of humanity, either profoundly stupid orprofoundly subtle, gradually bending beneath the weight of a terriblelikeness. This man, as the reader already knows, was a vagabond who hadbeen found in a field carrying a branch laden with ripe apples, broken inthe orchard of a neighbor, called the Pierron orchard. Who was this man?an examination had been made; witnesses had been heard, and they wereunanimous; light had abounded throughout the entire debate; the accusationsaid: &ldquo;We have in our grasp not only a marauder, a stealer of fruit; wehave here, in our hands, a bandit, an old offender who has broken his ban,an ex-convict, a miscreant of the most dangerous description, a malefactornamed Jean Valjean, whom justice has long been in search of, and who,eight years ago, on emerging from the galleys at Toulon, committed ahighway robbery, accompanied by violence, on the person of a child, aSavoyard named Little Gervais; a crime provided for by article 383 of thePenal Code, the right to try him for which we reserve hereafter, when hisidentity shall have been judicially established. He has just committed afresh theft; it is a case of a second offence; condemn him for the freshdeed; later on he will be judged for the old crime.&rdquo; In the face of thisaccusation, in the face of the unanimity of the witnesses, the accusedappeared to be astonished more than anything else; he made signs andgestures which were meant to convey No, or else he stared at the ceiling:he spoke with difficulty, replied with embarrassment, but his wholeperson, from head to foot, was a denial; he was an idiot in the presenceof all these minds ranged in order of battle around him, and like astranger in the midst of this society which was seizing fast upon him;nevertheless, it was a question of the most menacing future for him; thelikeness increased every moment, and the entire crowd surveyed, with moreanxiety than he did himself, that sentence freighted with calamity, whichdescended ever closer over his head; there was even a glimpse of apossibility afforded; besides the galleys, a possible death penalty, incase his identity were established, and the affair of Little Gervais wereto end thereafter in condemnation. Who was this man? what was the natureof his apathy? was it imbecility or craft? Did he understand too well, ordid he not understand at all? these were questions which divided thecrowd, and seemed to divide the jury; there was something both terribleand puzzling in this case: the drama was not only melancholy; it was alsoobscure.</p><p>The counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well, in that provincialtongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar, and which wasformerly employed by all advocates, at Paris as well as at Romorantin orat Montbrison, and which to-day, having become classic, is no longerspoken except by the official orators of magistracy, to whom it is suitedon account of its grave sonorousness and its majestic stride; a tongue inwhich a husband is called <i>a consort</i>, and a woman <i>a spouse</i>;Paris, <i>the centre of art and civilization</i>; the king, <i>the monarch</i>;Monseigneur the Bishop, <i>a sainted pontiff</i>; the district-attorney,<i>the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution</i>; the arguments, <i>theaccents which we have just listened to</i>; the age of Louis XIV., <i>thegrand age</i>; a theatre, <i>the temple of Melpomene</i>; the reigningfamily, <i>the august blood of our kings</i>; a concert, <i>a musicalsolemnity</i>; the General Commandant of the province, <i>the illustriouswarrior, who, etc.</i>; the pupils in the seminary, <i>these tenderlevities</i>; errors imputed to newspapers, <i>the imposture whichdistills its venom through the columns of those organs</i>; etc. Thelawyer had, accordingly, begun with an explanation as to the theft of theapples,&mdash;an awkward matter couched in fine style; but Bénigne Bossuethimself was obliged to allude to a chicken in the midst of a funeraloration, and he extricated himself from the situation in stately fashion.The lawyer established the fact that the theft of the apples had not beencircumstantially proved. His client, whom he, in his character of counsel,persisted in calling Champmathieu, had not been seen scaling that wall norbreaking that branch by any one. He had been taken with that branch (whichthe lawyer preferred to call a <i>bough</i>) in his possession; but hesaid that he had found it broken off and lying on the ground, and hadpicked it up. Where was there any proof to the contrary? No doubt thatbranch had been broken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall,then thrown away by the alarmed marauder; there was no doubt that therehad been a thief in the case. But what proof was there that that thief hadbeen Champmathieu? One thing only. His character as an ex-convict. Thelawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be, unhappily, wellattested; the accused had resided at Faverolles; the accused had exercisedthe calling of a tree-pruner there; the name of Champmathieu might wellhave had its origin in Jean Mathieu; all that was true,&mdash;in short,four witnesses recognize Champmathieu, positively and without hesitation,as that convict, Jean Valjean; to these signs, to this testimony, thecounsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his client, the denial ofan interested party; but supposing that he was the convict Jean Valjean,did that prove that he was the thief of the apples? that was a presumptionat the most, not a proof. The prisoner, it was true, and his counsel, &ldquo;ingood faith,&rdquo; was obliged to admit it, had adopted &ldquo;a bad system ofdefence.&rdquo; He obstinately denied everything, the theft and his character ofconvict. An admission upon this last point would certainly have beenbetter, and would have won for him the indulgence of his judges; thecounsel had advised him to do this; but the accused had obstinatelyrefused, thinking, no doubt, that he would save everything by admittingnothing. It was an error; but ought not the paucity of this intelligenceto be taken into consideration? This man was visibly stupid.Long-continued wretchedness in the galleys, long misery outside thegalleys, had brutalized him, etc. He defended himself badly; was that areason for condemning him? As for the affair with Little Gervais, thecounsel need not discuss it; it did not enter into the case. The lawyerwound up by beseeching the jury and the court, if the identity of JeanValjean appeared to them to be evident, to apply to him the policepenalties which are provided for a criminal who has broken his ban, andnot the frightful chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty of asecond offence.</p><p>The district-attorney answered the counsel for the defence. He was violentand florid, as district-attorneys usually are.</p><p>He congratulated the counsel for the defence on his &ldquo;loyalty,&rdquo; andskilfully took advantage of this loyalty. He reached the accused throughall the concessions made by his lawyer. The advocate had seemed to admitthat the prisoner was Jean Valjean. He took note of this. So this man wasJean Valjean. This point had been conceded to the accusation and could nolonger be disputed. Here, by means of a clever autonomasia which went backto the sources and causes of crime, the district-attorney thunderedagainst the immorality of the romantic school, then dawning under the nameof <i>the Satanic school</i>, which had been bestowed upon it by thecritics of the <i>Quotidienne</i> and the <i>Oriflamme</i>; he attributed,not without some probability, to the influence of this perverse literaturethe crime of Champmathieu, or rather, to speak more correctly, of JeanValjean. Having exhausted these considerations, he passed on to JeanValjean himself. Who was this Jean Valjean? Description of Jean Valjean: amonster spewed forth, etc. The model for this sort of description iscontained in the tale of Théramène, which is not useful to tragedy, butwhich every day renders great services to judicial eloquence. The audienceand the jury &ldquo;shuddered.&rdquo; The description finished, the district-attorneyresumed with an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of thejournal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day: Andit is such a man, etc., etc., etc., vagabond, beggar, without means ofexistence, etc., etc., inured by his past life to culpable deeds, and butlittle reformed by his sojourn in the galleys, as was proved by the crimecommitted against Little Gervais, etc., etc.; it is such a man, caughtupon the highway in the very act of theft, a few paces from a wall thathad been scaled, still holding in his hand the object stolen, who deniesthe crime, the theft, the climbing the wall; denies everything; denieseven his own identity! In addition to a hundred other proofs, to which wewill not recur, four witnesses recognize him&mdash;Javert, the uprightinspector of police; Javert, and three of his former companions in infamy,the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, and Cochepaille. What does he offer inopposition to this overwhelming unanimity? His denial. What obduracy! Youwill do justice, gentlemen of the jury, etc., etc. While thedistrict-attorney was speaking, the accused listened to him open-mouthed,with a sort of amazement in which some admiration was assuredly blended.He was evidently surprised that a man could talk like that. From time totime, at those &ldquo;energetic&rdquo; moments of the prosecutor&rsquo;s speech, wheneloquence which cannot contain itself overflows in a flood of witheringepithets and envelops the accused like a storm, he moved his head slowlyfrom right to left and from left to right in the sort of mute andmelancholy protest with which he had contented himself since the beginningof the argument. Two or three times the spectators who were nearest to himheard him say in a low voice, &ldquo;That is what comes of not having asked M.Baloup.&rdquo; The district-attorney directed the attention of the jury to thisstupid attitude, evidently deliberate, which denoted not imbecility, butcraft, skill, a habit of deceiving justice, and which set forth in all itsnakedness the &ldquo;profound perversity&rdquo; of this man. He ended by making hisreserves on the affair of Little Gervais and demanding a severe sentence.</p><p>At that time, as the reader will remember, it was penal servitude forlife.</p><p>The counsel for the defence rose, began by complimenting Monsieurl&rsquo;Avocat-General on his &ldquo;admirable speech,&rdquo; then replied as best he could;but he weakened; the ground was evidently slipping away from under hisfeet.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0064" id="link2HCH0064"></a>CHAPTER X&mdash;THE SYSTEM OF DENIALS</h3><p>The moment for closing the debate had arrived. The President had theaccused stand up, and addressed to him the customary question, &ldquo;Have youanything to add to your defence?&rdquo;</p><p>The man did not appear to understand, as he stood there, twisting in hishands a terrible cap which he had.</p><p>The President repeated the question.</p><p>This time the man heard it. He seemed to understand. He made a motion likea man who is just waking up, cast his eyes about him, stared at theaudience, the gendarmes, his counsel, the jury, the court, laid hismonstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his bench, took anotherlook, and all at once, fixing his glance upon the district-attorney, hebegan to speak. It was like an eruption. It seemed, from the manner inwhich the words escaped from his mouth,&mdash;incoherent, impetuous,pell-mell, tumbling over each other,&mdash;as though they were allpressing forward to issue forth at once. He said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;This is what I have to say. That I have been a wheelwright in Paris, andthat it was with Monsieur Baloup. It is a hard trade. In the wheelwright&rsquo;strade one works always in the open air, in courtyards, under sheds whenthe masters are good, never in closed workshops, because space isrequired, you see. In winter one gets so cold that one beats one&rsquo;s armstogether to warm one&rsquo;s self; but the masters don&rsquo;t like it; they say itwastes time. Handling iron when there is ice between the paving-stones ishard work. That wears a man out quickly. One is old while he is stillquite young in that trade. At forty a man is done for. I was fifty-three.I was in a bad state. And then, workmen are so mean! When a man is nolonger young, they call him nothing but an old bird, old beast! I was notearning more than thirty sous a day. They paid me as little as possible.The masters took advantage of my age&mdash;and then I had my daughter, whowas a laundress at the river. She earned a little also. It sufficed for ustwo. She had trouble, also; all day long up to her waist in a tub, inrain, in snow. When the wind cuts your face, when it freezes, it is allthe same; you must still wash. There are people who have not much linen,and wait until late; if you do not wash, you lose your custom. The planksare badly joined, and water drops on you from everywhere; you have yourpetticoats all damp above and below. That penetrates. She has also workedat the laundry of the Enfants-Rouges, where the water comes throughfaucets. You are not in the tub there; you wash at the faucet in front ofyou, and rinse in a basin behind you. As it is enclosed, you are not socold; but there is that hot steam, which is terrible, and which ruins youreyes. She came home at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and went to bed atonce, she was so tired. Her husband beat her. She is dead. We have notbeen very happy. She was a good girl, who did not go to the ball, and whowas very peaceable. I remember one Shrove-Tuesday when she went to bed ateight o&rsquo;clock. There, I am telling the truth; you have only to ask. Ah,yes! how stupid I am! Paris is a gulf. Who knows Father Champmathieuthere? But M. Baloup does, I tell you. Go see at M. Baloup&rsquo;s; and afterall, I don&rsquo;t know what is wanted of me.&rdquo;</p><p>The man ceased speaking, and remained standing. He had said these thingsin a loud, rapid, hoarse voice, with a sort of irritated and savageingenuousness. Once he paused to salute some one in the crowd. The sort ofaffirmations which he seemed to fling out before him at random came likehiccoughs, and to each he added the gesture of a wood-cutter who issplitting wood. When he had finished, the audience burst into a laugh. Hestared at the public, and, perceiving that they were laughing, and notunderstanding why, he began to laugh himself.</p><p>It was inauspicious.</p><p>The President, an attentive and benevolent man, raised his voice.</p><p>He reminded &ldquo;the gentlemen of the jury&rdquo; that &ldquo;the sieur Baloup, formerly amaster-wheelwright, with whom the accused stated that he had served, hadbeen summoned in vain. He had become bankrupt, and was not to be found.&rdquo; Then turning to the accused, he enjoined him to listen to what he wasabout to say, and added: &ldquo;You are in a position where reflection isnecessary. The gravest presumptions rest upon you, and may induce vitalresults. Prisoner, in your own interests, I summon you for the last timeto explain yourself clearly on two points. In the first place, did you ordid you not climb the wall of the Pierron orchard, break the branch, andsteal the apples; that is to say, commit the crime of breaking in andtheft? In the second place, are you the discharged convict, Jean Valjean&mdash;yesor no?&rdquo;</p><p>The prisoner shook his head with a capable air, like a man who hasthoroughly understood, and who knows what answer he is going to make. Heopened his mouth, turned towards the President, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;In the first place&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Then he stared at his cap, stared at the ceiling, and held his peace.</p><p>&ldquo;Prisoner,&rdquo; said the district-attorney, in a severe voice; &ldquo;pay attention.You are not answering anything that has been asked of you. Yourembarrassment condemns you. It is evident that your name is notChampmathieu; that you are the convict, Jean Valjean, concealed firstunder the name of Jean Mathieu, which was the name of his mother; that youwent to Auvergne; that you were born at Faverolles, where you were apruner of trees. It is evident that you have been guilty of entering, andof the theft of ripe apples from the Pierron orchard. The gentlemen of thejury will form their own opinion.&rdquo;</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0012" id="linkimage-0012"></a><img src="images/1b7-10-father-chapmathieu.jpg" alt="Father Champmathieu on Trial" width="100%" /></div><p>The prisoner had finally resumed his seat; he arose abruptly when thedistrict-attorney had finished, and exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You are very wicked; that you are! This what I wanted to say; I could notfind words for it at first. I have stolen nothing. I am a man who does nothave something to eat every day. I was coming from Ailly; I was walkingthrough the country after a shower, which had made the whole countryyellow: even the ponds were overflowed, and nothing sprang from the sandany more but the little blades of grass at the wayside. I found a brokenbranch with apples on the ground; I picked up the branch without knowingthat it would get me into trouble. I have been in prison, and they havebeen dragging me about for the last three months; more than that I cannotsay; people talk against me, they tell me, &lsquo;Answer!&rsquo; The gendarme, who isa good fellow, nudges my elbow, and says to me in a low voice, &lsquo;Come,answer!&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know how to explain; I have no education; I am a poorman; that is where they wrong me, because they do not see this. I have notstolen; I picked up from the ground things that were lying there. You say,Jean Valjean, Jean Mathieu! I don&rsquo;t know those persons; they arevillagers. I worked for M. Baloup, Boulevard de l&rsquo;Hôpital; my name isChampmathieu. You are very clever to tell me where I was born; I don&rsquo;tknow myself: it&rsquo;s not everybody who has a house in which to come into theworld; that would be too convenient. I think that my father and motherwere people who strolled along the highways; I know nothing different.When I was a child, they called me <i>young fellow</i>; now they call me<i>old Fellow</i>; those are my baptismal names; take that as you like. Ihave been in Auvergne; I have been at Faverolles. Pardi. Well! can&rsquo;t a manhave been in Auvergne, or at Faverolles, without having been in thegalleys? I tell you that I have not stolen, and that I am FatherChampmathieu; I have been with M. Baloup; I have had a settled residence.You worry me with your nonsense, there! Why is everybody pursuing me sofuriously?&rdquo;</p><p>The district-attorney had remained standing; he addressed the President:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Président, in view of the confused but exceedingly cleverdenials of the prisoner, who would like to pass himself off as an idiot,but who will not succeed in so doing,&mdash;we shall attend to that,&mdash;wedemand that it shall please you and that it shall please the court tosummon once more into this place the convicts Brevet, Cochepaille, andChenildieu, and Police-Inspector Javert, and question them for the lasttime as to the identity of the prisoner with the convict Jean Valjean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would remind the district-attorney,&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;thatPolice-Inspector Javert, recalled by his duties to the capital of aneighboring arrondissement, left the court-room and the town as soon as hehad made his deposition; we have accorded him permission, with the consentof the district-attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true, Mr. President,&rdquo; responded the district-attorney. &ldquo;In theabsence of sieur Javert, I think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of thejury of what he said here a few hours ago. Javert is an estimable man, whodoes honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior but importantfunctions. These are the terms of his deposition: &lsquo;I do not even stand inneed of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions to give the lie tothe prisoner&rsquo;s denial. I recognize him perfectly. The name of this man isnot Champmathieu; he is an ex-convict named Jean Valjean, and is veryvicious and much to be feared. It is only with extreme regret that he wasreleased at the expiration of his term. He underwent nineteen years ofpenal servitude for theft. He made five or six attempts to escape. Besidesthe theft from Little Gervais, and from the Pierron orchard, I suspect himof a theft committed in the house of His Grace the late Bishop of D&mdash;&mdash;I often saw him at the time when I was adjutant of the galley-guard at theprison in Toulon. I repeat that I recognize him perfectly.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>This extremely precise statement appeared to produce a vivid impression onthe public and on the jury. The district-attorney concluded by insisting,that in default of Javert, the three witnesses Brevet, Chenildieu, andCochepaille should be heard once more and solemnly interrogated.</p><p>The President transmitted the order to an usher, and, a moment later, thedoor of the witnesses&rsquo; room opened. The usher, accompanied by a gendarmeready to lend him armed assistance, introduced the convict Brevet. Theaudience was in suspense; and all breasts heaved as though they hadcontained but one soul.</p><p>The ex-convict Brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the centralprisons. Brevet was a person sixty years of age, who had a sort ofbusiness man&rsquo;s face, and the air of a rascal. The two sometimes gotogether. In prison, whither fresh misdeeds had led him, he had becomesomething in the nature of a turnkey. He was a man of whom his superiorssaid, &ldquo;He tries to make himself of use.&rdquo; The chaplains bore good testimonyas to his religious habits. It must not be forgotten that this passedunder the Restoration.</p><p>&ldquo;Brevet,&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;you have undergone an ignominious sentence,and you cannot take an oath.&rdquo;</p><p>Brevet dropped his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; continued the President, &ldquo;even in the man whom the law hasdegraded, there may remain, when the divine mercy permits it, a sentimentof honor and of equity. It is to this sentiment that I appeal at thisdecisive hour. If it still exists in you,&mdash;and I hope it does,&mdash;reflectbefore replying to me: consider on the one hand, this man, whom a wordfrom you may ruin; on the other hand, justice, which a word from you mayenlighten. The instant is solemn; there is still time to retract if youthink you have been mistaken. Rise, prisoner. Brevet, take a good look atthe accused, recall your souvenirs, and tell us on your soul andconscience, if you persist in recognizing this man as your formercompanion in the galleys, Jean Valjean?&rdquo;</p><p>Brevet looked at the prisoner, then turned towards the court.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. President, I was the first to recognize him, and I stick to it;that man is Jean Valjean, who entered at Toulon in 1796, and left in 1815.I left a year later. He has the air of a brute now; but it must be becauseage has brutalized him; he was sly at the galleys: I recognize himpositively.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take your seat,&rdquo; said the President. &ldquo;Prisoner, remain standing.&rdquo;</p><p>Chenildieu was brought in, a prisoner for life, as was indicated by hisred cassock and his green cap. He was serving out his sentence at thegalleys of Toulon, whence he had been brought for this case. He was asmall man of about fifty, brisk, wrinkled, frail, yellow, brazen-faced,feverish, who had a sort of sickly feebleness about all his limbs and hiswhole person, and an immense force in his glance. His companions in thegalleys had nicknamed him <i>I-deny-God</i> (<i>Je-nie Dieu</i>,Chenildieu).</p><p>The President addressed him in nearly the same words which he had used toBrevet. At the moment when he reminded him of his infamy which deprivedhim of the right to take an oath, Chenildieu raised his head and lookedthe crowd in the face. The President invited him to reflection, and askedhim as he had asked Brevet, if he persisted in recognition of theprisoner.</p><p>Chenildieu burst out laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardieu, as if I didn&rsquo;t recognize him! We were attached to the same chainfor five years. So you are sulking, old fellow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go take your seat,&rdquo; said the President.</p><p>The usher brought in Cochepaille. He was another convict for life, who hadcome from the galleys, and was dressed in red, like Chenildieu, was apeasant from Lourdes, and a half-bear of the Pyrenees. He had guarded theflocks among the mountains, and from a shepherd he had slipped into abrigand. Cochepaille was no less savage and seemed even more stupid thanthe prisoner. He was one of those wretched men whom nature has sketchedout for wild beasts, and on whom society puts the finishing touches asconvicts in the galleys.</p><p>The President tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words, andasked him, as he had asked the other two, if he persisted, withouthesitation or trouble, in recognizing the man who was standing before him.</p><p>&ldquo;He is Jean Valjean,&rdquo; said Cochepaille. &ldquo;He was even calledJean-the-Screw, because he was so strong.&rdquo;</p><p>Each of these affirmations from these three men, evidently sincere and ingood faith, had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for theprisoner,&mdash;a murmur which increased and lasted longer each time thata fresh declaration was added to the proceeding.</p><p>The prisoner had listened to them, with that astounded face which was,according to the accusation, his principal means of defence; at the first,the gendarmes, his neighbors, had heard him mutter between his teeth: &ldquo;Ah,well, he&rsquo;s a nice one!&rdquo; after the second, he said, a little louder, withan air that was almost that of satisfaction, &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; at the third, hecried, &ldquo;Famous!&rdquo;</p><p>The President addressed him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you heard, prisoner? What have you to say?&rdquo;</p><p>He replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I say, &lsquo;Famous!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>An uproar broke out among the audience, and was communicated to the jury;it was evident that the man was lost.</p><p>&ldquo;Ushers,&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;enforce silence! I am going to sum up thearguments.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment there was a movement just beside the President; a voice washeard crying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Brevet! Chenildieu! Cochepaille! look here!&rdquo;</p><p>All who heard that voice were chilled, so lamentable and terrible was it;all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded. A man, placedamong the privileged spectators who were seated behind the court, had justrisen, had pushed open the half-door which separated the tribunal from theaudience, and was standing in the middle of the hall; the President, thedistrict-attorney, M. Bamatabois, twenty persons, recognized him, andexclaimed in concert:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;M. Madeleine!&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0065" id="link2HCH0065"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;CHAMPMATHIEU MORE AND MORE ASTONISHED</h3><p>It was he, in fact. The clerk&rsquo;s lamp illumined his countenance. He heldhis hat in his hand; there was no disorder in his clothing; his coat wascarefully buttoned; he was very pale, and he trembled slightly; his hair,which had still been gray on his arrival in Arras, was now entirely white:it had turned white during the hour he had sat there.</p><p>All heads were raised: the sensation was indescribable; there was amomentary hesitation in the audience, the voice had been so heart-rending;the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did not understand atfirst. They asked themselves whether he had indeed uttered that cry; theycould not believe that that tranquil man had been the one to give thatterrible outcry.</p><p>This indecision only lasted a few seconds. Even before the President andthe district-attorney could utter a word, before the ushers and thegendarmes could make a gesture, the man whom all still called, at thatmoment, M. Madeleine, had advanced towards the witnesses Cochepaille,Brevet, and Chenildieu.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you not recognize me?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>All three remained speechless, and indicated by a sign of the head thatthey did not know him. Cochepaille, who was intimidated, made a militarysalute. M. Madeleine turned towards the jury and the court, and said in agentle voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Gentlemen of the jury, order the prisoner to be released! Mr. President,have me arrested. He is not the man whom you are in search of; it is I: Iam Jean Valjean.&rdquo;</p><p>Not a mouth breathed; the first commotion of astonishment had beenfollowed by a silence like that of the grave; those within the hallexperienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses whensomething grand has been done.</p><p>In the meantime, the face of the President was stamped with sympathy andsadness; he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district-attorney and afew low-toned words with the assistant judges; he addressed the public,and asked in accents which all understood:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there a physician present?&rdquo;</p><p>The district-attorney took the word:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Gentlemen of the jury, the very strange and unexpected incident whichdisturbs the audience inspires us, like yourselves, only with a sentimentwhich it is unnecessary for us to express. You all know, by reputation atleast, the honorable M. Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M.; if there is aphysician in the audience, we join the President in requesting him toattend to M. Madeleine, and to conduct him to his home.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine did not allow the district-attorney to finish; he interruptedhim in accents full of suavity and authority. These are the words which heuttered; here they are literally, as they were written down, immediatelyafter the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene, and as they nowring in the ears of those who heard them nearly forty years ago:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I thank you, Mr. District-Attorney, but I am not mad; you shall see; youwere on the point of committing a great error; release this man! I amfulfilling a duty; I am that miserable criminal. I am the only one herewho sees the matter clearly, and I am telling you the truth. God, who ison high, looks down on what I am doing at this moment, and that suffices.You can take me, for here I am: but I have done my best; I concealedmyself under another name; I have become rich; I have become a mayor; Ihave tried to re-enter the ranks of the honest. It seems that that is notto be done. In short, there are many things which I cannot tell. I willnot narrate the story of my life to you; you will hear it one of thesedays. I robbed Monseigneur the Bishop, it is true; it is true that Irobbed Little Gervais; they were right in telling you that Jean Valjeanwas a very vicious wretch. Perhaps it was not altogether his fault.Listen, honorable judges! a man who has been so greatly humbled as I havehas neither any remonstrances to make to Providence, nor any advice togive to society; but, you see, the infamy from which I have tried toescape is an injurious thing; the galleys make the convict what he is;reflect upon that, if you please. Before going to the galleys, I was apoor peasant, with very little intelligence, a sort of idiot; the galleyswrought a change in me. I was stupid; I became vicious: I was a block ofwood; I became a firebrand. Later on, indulgence and kindness saved me, asseverity had ruined me. But, pardon me, you cannot understand what I amsaying. You will find at my house, among the ashes in the fireplace, theforty-sou piece which I stole, seven years ago, from Little Gervais. Ihave nothing farther to add; take me. Good God! the district-attorneyshakes his head; you say, &lsquo;M. Madeleine has gone mad!&rsquo; you do not believeme! that is distressing. Do not, at least, condemn this man! What! thesemen do not recognize me! I wish Javert were here; he would recognize me.&rdquo;</p><p>Nothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone whichaccompanied these words.</p><p>He turned to the three convicts, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I recognize you; do you remember, Brevet?&rdquo;</p><p>He paused, hesitated for an instant, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which youwore in the galleys?&rdquo;</p><p>Brevet gave a start of surprise, and surveyed him from head to foot with afrightened air. He continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Chenildieu, you who conferred on yourself the name of &lsquo;Jenie-Dieu,&rsquo; yourwhole right shoulder bears a deep burn, because you one day laid yourshoulder against the chafing-dish full of coals, in order to efface thethree letters T. F. P., which are still visible, nevertheless; answer, isthis true?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Chenildieu.</p><p>He addressed himself to Cochepaille:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Cochepaille, you have, near the bend in your left arm, a date stamped inblue letters with burnt powder; the date is that of the landing of theEmperor at Cannes, March 1, 1815; pull up your sleeve!&rdquo;</p><p>Cochepaille pushed up his sleeve; all eyes were focused on him and on hisbare arm.</p><p>A gendarme held a light close to it; there was the date.</p><p>The unhappy man turned to the spectators and the judges with a smile whichstill rends the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think of it. It wasa smile of triumph; it was also a smile of despair.</p><p>&ldquo;You see plainly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I am Jean Valjean.&rdquo;</p><p>In that chamber there were no longer either judges, accusers, norgendarmes; there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts. Noone recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to play;the district-attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of prosecuting,the President that he was there to preside, the counsel for the defencethat he was there to defend. It was a striking circumstance that noquestion was put, that no authority intervened. The peculiarity of sublimespectacles is, that they capture all souls and turn witnesses intospectators. No one, probably, could have explained what he felt; no one,probably, said to himself that he was witnessing the splendid outburst ofa grand light: all felt themselves inwardly dazzled.</p><p>It was evident that they had Jean Valjean before their eyes. That wasclear. The appearance of this man had sufficed to suffuse with light thatmatter which had been so obscure but a moment previously, without anyfurther explanation: the whole crowd, as by a sort of electric revelation,understood instantly and at a single glance the simple and magnificenthistory of a man who was delivering himself up so that another man mightnot be condemned in his stead. The details, the hesitations, littlepossible oppositions, were swallowed up in that vast and luminous fact.</p><p>It was an impression which vanished speedily, but which was irresistibleat the moment.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not wish to disturb the court further,&rdquo; resumed Jean Valjean. &ldquo;Ishall withdraw, since you do not arrest me. I have many things to do. Thedistrict-attorney knows who I am; he knows whither I am going; he can haveme arrested when he likes.&rdquo;</p><p>He directed his steps towards the door. Not a voice was raised, not an armextended to hinder him. All stood aside. At that moment there was abouthim that divine something which causes multitudes to stand aside and makeway for a man. He traversed the crowd slowly. It was never known whoopened the door, but it is certain that he found the door open when hereached it. On arriving there he turned round and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am at your command, Mr. District-Attorney.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he addressed the audience:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;All of you, all who are present&mdash;consider me worthy of pity, do younot? Good God! When I think of what I was on the point of doing, Iconsider that I am to be envied. Nevertheless, I should have preferred notto have had this occur.&rdquo;</p><p>He withdrew, and the door closed behind him as it had opened, for thosewho do certain sovereign things are always sure of being served by someone in the crowd.</p><p>Less than an hour after this, the verdict of the jury freed the saidChampmathieu from all accusations; and Champmathieu, being at oncereleased, went off in a state of stupefaction, thinking that all men werefools, and comprehending nothing of this vision.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0077" id="link2H_4_0077"></a>BOOK EIGHTH&mdash;A COUNTER-BLOW</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0066" id="link2HCH0066"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;IN WHAT MIRROR M. MADELEINE CONTEMPLATES HIS HAIR</h3><p>The day had begun to dawn. Fantine had passed a sleepless and feverishnight, filled with happy visions; at daybreak she fell asleep. SisterSimplice, who had been watching with her, availed herself of this slumberto go and prepare a new potion of chinchona. The worthy sister had been inthe laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments, bending over her drugsand phials, and scrutinizing things very closely, on account of thedimness which the half-light of dawn spreads over all objects. Suddenlyshe raised her head and uttered a faint shriek. M. Madeleine stood beforeher; he had just entered silently.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it you, Mr. Mayor?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p><p>He replied in a low voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;How is that poor woman?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not so bad just now; but we have been very uneasy.&rdquo;</p><p>She explained to him what had passed: that Fantine had been very ill theday before, and that she was better now, because she thought that themayor had gone to Montfermeil to get her child. The sister dared notquestion the mayor; but she perceived plainly from his air that he had notcome from there.</p><p>&ldquo;All that is good,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you were right not to undeceive her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded the sister; &ldquo;but now, Mr. Mayor, she will see you andwill not see her child. What shall we say to her?&rdquo;</p><p>He reflected for a moment.</p><p>&ldquo;God will inspire us,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;But we cannot tell a lie,&rdquo; murmured the sister, half aloud.</p><p>It was broad daylight in the room. The light fell full on M. Madeleine&rsquo;sface. The sister chanced to raise her eyes to it.</p><p>&ldquo;Good God, sir!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;what has happened to you? Your hair isperfectly white!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;White!&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Sister Simplice had no mirror. She rummaged in a drawer, and pulled outthe little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whether apatient was dead and whether he no longer breathed. M. Madeleine took themirror, looked at his hair, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p><p>He uttered the word indifferently, and as though his mind were onsomething else.</p><p>The sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a glimpsein all this.</p><p>He inquired:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Can I see her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is not Monsieur le Maire going to have her child brought back to her?&rdquo; said the sister, hardly venturing to put the question.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course; but it will take two or three days at least.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If she were not to see Monsieur le Maire until that time,&rdquo; went on thesister, timidly, &ldquo;she would not know that Monsieur le Maire had returned,and it would be easy to inspire her with patience; and when the childarrived, she would naturally think Monsieur le Maire had just come withthe child. We should not have to enact a lie.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments; then he said with hiscalm gravity:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;No, sister, I must see her. I may, perhaps, be in haste.&rdquo;</p><p>The nun did not appear to notice this word &ldquo;perhaps,&rdquo; which communicatedan obscure and singular sense to the words of the mayor&rsquo;s speech. Shereplied, lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case, she is asleep; but Monsieur le Maire may enter.&rdquo;</p><p>He made some remarks about a door which shut badly, and the noise of whichmight awaken the sick woman; then he entered Fantine&rsquo;s chamber, approachedthe bed and drew aside the curtains. She was asleep. Her breath issuedfrom her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiar to thosemaladies, and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they are watchingthrough the night beside their sleeping child who is condemned to death.But this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort of ineffable serenitywhich overspread her countenance, and which transfigured her in her sleep.Her pallor had become whiteness; her cheeks were crimson; her long goldenlashes, the only beauty of her youth and her virginity which remained toher, palpitated, though they remained closed and drooping. Her wholeperson was trembling with an indescribable unfolding of wings, all readyto open wide and bear her away, which could be felt as they rustled,though they could not be seen. To see her thus, one would never havedreamed that she was an invalid whose life was almost despaired of. Sheresembled rather something on the point of soaring away than something onthe point of dying.</p><p>The branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower, and seemsto both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time. The humanbody has something of this tremor when the instant arrives in which themysterious fingers of Death are about to pluck the soul.</p><p>M. Madeleine remained for some time motionless beside that bed, gazing inturn upon the sick woman and the crucifix, as he had done two monthsbefore, on the day when he had come for the first time to see her in thatasylum. They were both still there in the same attitude&mdash;shesleeping, he praying; only now, after the lapse of two months, her hairwas gray and his was white.</p><p>The sister had not entered with him. He stood beside the bed, with hisfinger on his lips, as though there were some one in the chamber whom hemust enjoin to silence.</p><p>She opened her eyes, saw him, and said quietly, with a smile:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And Cosette?&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0067" id="link2HCH0067"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;FANTINE HAPPY</h3><p>She made no movement of either surprise or of joy; she was joy itself.That simple question, &ldquo;And Cosette?&rdquo; was put with so profound a faith,with so much certainty, with such a complete absence of disquiet and ofdoubt, that he found not a word of reply. She continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew that you were there. I was asleep, but I saw you. I have seen youfor a long, long time. I have been following you with my eyes all nightlong. You were in a glory, and you had around you all sorts of celestialforms.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised his glance to the crucifix.</p><p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;tell me where Cosette is. Why did not you place heron my bed against the moment of my waking?&rdquo;</p><p>He made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able torecall.</p><p>Fortunately, the doctor had been warned, and he now made his appearance.He came to the aid of M. Madeleine.</p><p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, my child,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;your child is here.&rdquo;</p><p>Fantine&rsquo;s eyes beamed and filled her whole face with light. She claspedher hands with an expression which contained all that is possible toprayer in the way of violence and tenderness.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;bring her to me!&rdquo;</p><p>Touching illusion of a mother! Cosette was, for her, still the littlechild who is carried.</p><p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;not just now. You still have some fever. Thesight of your child would agitate you and do you harm. You must be curedfirst.&rdquo;</p><p>She interrupted him impetuously:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;But I am cured! Oh, I tell you that I am cured! What an ass that doctoris! The idea! I want to see my child!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;how excited you become. So long as you are inthis state I shall oppose your having your child. It is not enough to seeher; it is necessary that you should live for her. When you arereasonable, I will bring her to you myself.&rdquo;</p><p>The poor mother bowed her head.</p><p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, doctor, I really beg your pardon. Formerly I shouldnever have spoken as I have just done; so many misfortunes have happenedto me, that I sometimes do not know what I am saying. I understand you;you fear the emotion. I will wait as long as you like, but I swear to youthat it would not have harmed me to see my daughter. I have been seeingher; I have not taken my eyes from her since yesterday evening. Do youknow? If she were brought to me now, I should talk to her very gently.That is all. Is it not quite natural that I should desire to see mydaughter, who has been brought to me expressly from Montfermeil? I am notangry. I know well that I am about to be happy. All night long I have seenwhite things, and persons who smiled at me. When Monsieur le Docteurpleases, he shall bring me Cosette. I have no longer any fever; I am well.I am perfectly conscious that there is nothing the matter with me anymore; but I am going to behave as though I were ill, and not stir, toplease these ladies here. When it is seen that I am very calm, they willsay, &lsquo;She must have her child.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed. She turned towardshim; she was making a visible effort to be calm and &ldquo;very good,&rdquo; as sheexpressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy, inorder that, seeing her so peaceable, they might make no difficulty aboutbringing Cosette to her. But while she controlled herself she could notrefrain from questioning M. Madeleine.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you have a pleasant trip, Monsieur le Maire? Oh! how good you were togo and get her for me! Only tell me how she is. Did she stand the journeywell? Alas! she will not recognize me. She must have forgotten me by thistime, poor darling! Children have no memories. They are like birds. Achild sees one thing to-day and another thing to-morrow, and thinks ofnothing any longer. And did she have white linen? Did those Thénardierskeep her clean? How have they fed her? Oh! if you only knew how I havesuffered, putting such questions as that to myself during all the time ofmy wretchedness. Now, it is all past. I am happy. Oh, how I should like tosee her! Do you think her pretty, Monsieur le Maire? Is not my daughterbeautiful? You must have been very cold in that diligence! Could she notbe brought for just one little instant? She might be taken away directlyafterwards. Tell me; you are the master; it could be so if you chose!&rdquo;</p><p>He took her hand. &ldquo;Cosette is beautiful,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Cosette is well. Youshall see her soon; but calm yourself; you are talking with too muchvivacity, and you are throwing your arms out from under the clothes, andthat makes you cough.&rdquo;</p><p>In fact, fits of coughing interrupted Fantine at nearly every word.</p><p>Fantine did not murmur; she feared that she had injured by her toopassionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous ofinspiring, and she began to talk of indifferent things.</p><p>&ldquo;Montfermeil is quite pretty, is it not? People go there on pleasureparties in summer. Are the Thénardiers prosperous? There are not manytravellers in their parts. That inn of theirs is a sort of a cook-shop.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Madeleine was still holding her hand, and gazing at her with anxiety;it was evident that he had come to tell her things before which his mindnow hesitated. The doctor, having finished his visit, retired. SisterSimplice remained alone with them.</p><p>But in the midst of this pause Fantine exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I hear her! mon Dieu, I hear her!&rdquo;</p><p>She stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her, held her breath,and began to listen with rapture.</p><p>There was a child playing in the yard&mdash;the child of the portress orof some work-woman. It was one of those accidents which are alwaysoccurring, and which seem to form a part of the mysterious stage-settingof mournful scenes. The child&mdash;a little girl&mdash;was going andcoming, running to warm herself, laughing, singing at the top of hervoice. Alas! in what are the plays of children not intermingled. It wasthis little girl whom Fantine heard singing.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;it is my Cosette! I recognize her voice.&rdquo;</p><p>The child retreated as it had come; the voice died away. Fantine listenedfor a while longer, then her face clouded over, and M. Madeleine heard hersay, in a low voice: &ldquo;How wicked that doctor is not to allow me to see mydaughter! That man has an evil countenance, that he has.&rdquo;</p><p>But the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again. Shecontinued to talk to herself, with her head resting on the pillow: &ldquo;Howhappy we are going to be! We shall have a little garden the very firstthing; M. Madeleine has promised it to me. My daughter will play in thegarden. She must know her letters by this time. I will make her spell. Shewill run over the grass after butterflies. I will watch her. Then she willtake her first communion. Ah! when will she take her first communion?&rdquo;</p><p>She began to reckon on her fingers.</p><p>&ldquo;One, two, three, four&mdash;she is seven years old. In five years shewill have a white veil, and openwork stockings; she will look like alittle woman. O my good sister, you do not know how foolish I become whenI think of my daughter&rsquo;s first communion!&rdquo;</p><p>She began to laugh.</p><p>He had released Fantine&rsquo;s hand. He listened to her words as one listens tothe sighing of the breeze, with his eyes on the ground, his mind absorbedin reflection which had no bottom. All at once she ceased speaking, andthis caused him to raise his head mechanically. Fantine had becometerrible.</p><p>She no longer spoke, she no longer breathed; she had raised herself to asitting posture, her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise; her face,which had been radiant but a moment before, was ghastly, and she seemed tohave fixed her eyes, rendered large with terror, on something alarming atthe other extremity of the room.</p><p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;what ails you, Fantine?&rdquo;</p><p>She made no reply; she did not remove her eyes from the object which sheseemed to see. She removed one hand from his arm, and with the other madehim a sign to look behind him.</p><p>He turned, and beheld Javert.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0068" id="link2HCH0068"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;JAVERT SATISFIED</h3><p>This is what had taken place.</p><p>The half-hour after midnight had just struck when M. Madeleine quitted theHall of Assizes in Arras. He regained his inn just in time to set outagain by the mail-wagon, in which he had engaged his place. A littlebefore six o&rsquo;clock in the morning he had arrived at M. sur M., and hisfirst care had been to post a letter to M. Laffitte, then to enter theinfirmary and see Fantine.</p><p>However, he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the Court of Assizes,when the district-attorney, recovering from his first shock, had taken theword to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of M. sur M., todeclare that his convictions had not been in the least modified by thatcurious incident, which would be explained thereafter, and to demand, inthe meantime, the condemnation of that Champmathieu, who was evidently thereal Jean Valjean. The district-attorney&rsquo;s persistence was visibly atvariance with the sentiments of every one, of the public, of the court,and of the jury. The counsel for the defence had some difficulty inrefuting this harangue and in establishing that, in consequence of therevelations of M. Madeleine, that is to say, of the real Jean Valjean, theaspect of the matter had been thoroughly altered, and that the jury hadbefore their eyes now only an innocent man. Thence the lawyer had drawnsome epiphonemas, not very fresh, unfortunately, upon judicial errors,etc., etc.; the President, in his summing up, had joined the counsel forthe defence, and in a few minutes the jury had thrown Champmathieu out ofthe case.</p><p>Nevertheless, the district-attorney was bent on having a Jean Valjean; andas he had no longer Champmathieu, he took Madeleine.</p><p>Immediately after Champmathieu had been set at liberty, thedistrict-attorney shut himself up with the President. They conferred &ldquo;asto the necessity of seizing the person of M. le Maire of M. sur M.&rdquo; Thisphrase, in which there was a great deal of <i>of</i>, is thedistrict-attorney&rsquo;s, written with his own hand, on the minutes of hisreport to the attorney-general. His first emotion having passed off, thePresident did not offer many objections. Justice must, after all, take itscourse. And then, when all was said, although the President was a kindlyand a tolerably intelligent man, he was, at the same time, a devoted andalmost an ardent royalist, and he had been shocked to hear the Mayor of M.sur M. say the <i>Emperor</i>, and not <i>Bonaparte</i>, when alluding tothe landing at Cannes.</p><p>The order for his arrest was accordingly despatched. The district-attorneyforwarded it to M. sur M. by a special messenger, at full speed, andentrusted its execution to Police Inspector Javert.</p><p>The reader knows that Javert had returned to M. sur M. immediately afterhaving given his deposition.</p><p>Javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the orderof arrest and the command to produce the prisoner.</p><p>The messenger himself was a very clever member of the police, who, in twowords, informed Javert of what had taken place at Arras. The order ofarrest, signed by the district-attorney, was couched in these words:&ldquo;Inspector Javert will apprehend the body of the Sieur Madeleine, mayor ofM. sur M., who, in this day&rsquo;s session of the court, was recognized as theliberated convict, Jean Valjean.&rdquo;</p><p>Any one who did not know Javert, and who had chanced to see him at themoment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary, could havedivined nothing of what had taken place, and would have thought his airthe most ordinary in the world. He was cool, calm, grave, his gray hairwas perfectly smooth upon his temples, and he had just mounted the stairswith his habitual deliberation. Any one who was thoroughly acquainted withhim, and who had examined him attentively at the moment, would haveshuddered. The buckle of his leather stock was under his left ear insteadof at the nape of his neck. This betrayed unwonted agitation.</p><p>Javert was a complete character, who never had a wrinkle in his duty or inhis uniform; methodical with malefactors, rigid with the buttons of hiscoat.</p><p>That he should have set the buckle of his stock awry, it was indispensablethat there should have taken place in him one of those emotions which maybe designated as internal earthquakes.</p><p>He had come in a simple way, had made a requisition on the neighboringpost for a corporal and four soldiers, had left the soldiers in thecourtyard, had had Fantine&rsquo;s room pointed out to him by the portress, whowas utterly unsuspicious, accustomed as she was to seeing armed meninquiring for the mayor.</p><p>On arriving at Fantine&rsquo;s chamber, Javert turned the handle, pushed thedoor open with the gentleness of a sick-nurse or a police spy, andentered.</p><p>Properly speaking, he did not enter. He stood erect in the half-open door,his hat on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat, which wasbuttoned up to the chin. In the bend of his elbow the leaden head of hisenormous cane, which was hidden behind him, could be seen.</p><p>Thus he remained for nearly a minute, without his presence beingperceived. All at once Fantine raised her eyes, saw him, and made M.Madeleine turn round.</p><p>The instant that Madeleine&rsquo;s glance encountered Javert&rsquo;s glance, Javert,without stirring, without moving from his post, without approaching him,became terrible. No human sentiment can be as terrible as joy.</p><p>It was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul.</p><p>The satisfaction of at last getting hold of Jean Valjean caused all thatwas in his soul to appear in his countenance. The depths having beenstirred up, mounted to the surface. The humiliation of having, in someslight degree, lost the scent, and of having indulged, for a few moments,in an error with regard to Champmathieu, was effaced by pride at having sowell and accurately divined in the first place, and of having for so longcherished a just instinct. Javert&rsquo;s content shone forth in his sovereignattitude. The deformity of triumph overspread that narrow brow. All thedemonstrations of horror which a satisfied face can afford were there.</p><p>Javert was in heaven at that moment. Without putting the thing clearly tohimself, but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his presenceand of his success, he, Javert, personified justice, light, and truth intheir celestial function of crushing out evil. Behind him and around him,at an infinite distance, he had authority, reason, the case judged, thelegal conscience, the public prosecution, all the stars; he was protectingorder, he was causing the law to yield up its thunders, he was avengingsociety, he was lending a helping hand to the absolute, he was standingerect in the midst of a glory. There existed in his victory a remnant ofdefiance and of combat. Erect, haughty, brilliant, he flaunted abroad inopen day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious archangel. The terribleshadow of the action which he was accomplishing caused the vague flash ofthe social sword to be visible in his clenched fist; happy and indignant,he held his heel upon crime, vice, rebellion, perdition, hell; he wasradiant, he exterminated, he smiled, and there was an incontestablegrandeur in this monstrous Saint Michael.</p><p>Javert, though frightful, had nothing ignoble about him.</p><p>Probity, sincerity, candor, conviction, the sense of duty, are thingswhich may become hideous when wrongly directed; but which, even whenhideous, remain grand: their majesty, the majesty peculiar to the humanconscience, clings to them in the midst of horror; they are virtues whichhave one vice,&mdash;error. The honest, pitiless joy of a fanatic in thefull flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubriously venerableradiance. Without himself suspecting the fact, Javert in his formidablehappiness was to be pitied, as is every ignorant man who triumphs. Nothingcould be so poignant and so terrible as this face, wherein was displayedall that may be designated as the evil of the good.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0069" id="link2HCH0069"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;AUTHORITY REASSERTS ITS RIGHTS</h3><p>Fantine had not seen Javert since the day on which the mayor had torn herfrom the man. Her ailing brain comprehended nothing, but the only thingwhich she did not doubt was that he had come to get her. She could notendure that terrible face; she felt her life quitting her; she hid herface in both hands, and shrieked in her anguish:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Madeleine, save me!&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean&mdash;we shall henceforth not speak of him otherwise&mdash;hadrisen. He said to Fantine in the gentlest and calmest of voices:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Be at ease; it is not for you that he is come.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he addressed Javert, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I know what you want.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Be quick about it!&rdquo;</p><p>There lay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these wordssomething indescribably fierce and frenzied. Javert did not say, &ldquo;Be quickabout it!&rdquo; he said &ldquo;Bequiabouit.&rdquo;</p><p>No orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered: itwas no longer a human word: it was a roar.</p><p>He did not proceed according to his custom, he did not enter into thematter, he exhibited no warrant of arrest. In his eyes, Jean Valjean was asort of mysterious combatant, who was not to be laid hands upon, awrestler in the dark whom he had had in his grasp for the last five years,without being able to throw him. This arrest was not a beginning, but anend. He confined himself to saying, &ldquo;Be quick about it!&rdquo;</p><p>As he spoke thus, he did not advance a single step; he hurled at JeanValjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling-hook, and with whichhe was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him.</p><p>It was this glance which Fantine had felt penetrating to the very marrowof her bones two months previously.</p><p>At Javert&rsquo;s exclamation, Fantine opened her eyes once more. But the mayorwas there; what had she to fear?</p><p>Javert advanced to the middle of the room, and cried:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;See here now! Art thou coming?&rdquo;</p><p>The unhappy woman glanced about her. No one was present excepting the nunand the mayor. To whom could that abject use of &ldquo;thou&rdquo; be addressed? Toher only. She shuddered.</p><p>Then she beheld a most unprecedented thing, a thing so unprecedented thatnothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackest deliriums offever.</p><p>She beheld Javert, the police spy, seize the mayor by the collar; she sawthe mayor bow his head. It seemed to her that the world was coming to anend.</p><p>Javert had, in fact, grasped Jean Valjean by the collar.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Maire!&rdquo; shrieked Fantine.</p><p>Javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed allhis gums.</p><p>&ldquo;There is no longer any Monsieur le Maire here!&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped thecollar of his coat. He said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Javert&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Javert interrupted him: &ldquo;Call me Mr. Inspector.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, &ldquo;I should like to say a word to you inprivate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Aloud! Say it aloud!&rdquo; replied Javert; &ldquo;people are in the habit of talkingaloud to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean went on in a lower tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a request to make of you&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I tell you to speak loud.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you alone should hear it&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What difference does that make to me? I shall not listen.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean turned towards him and said very rapidly and in a very lowvoice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Grant me three days&rsquo; grace! three days in which to go and fetch the childof this unhappy woman. I will pay whatever is necessary. You shallaccompany me if you choose.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are making sport of me!&rdquo; cried Javert. &ldquo;Come now, I did not think yousuch a fool! You ask me to give you three days in which to run away! Yousay that it is for the purpose of fetching that creature&rsquo;s child! Ah! Ah!That&rsquo;s good! That&rsquo;s really capital!&rdquo;</p><p>Fantine was seized with a fit of trembling.</p><p>&ldquo;My child!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;to go and fetch my child! She is not here, then!Answer me, sister; where is Cosette? I want my child! Monsieur Madeleine!Monsieur le Maire!&rdquo;</p><p>Javert stamped his foot.</p><p>&ldquo;And now there&rsquo;s the other one! Will you hold your tongue, you hussy? It&rsquo;sa pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates, and where womenof the town are cared for like countesses! Ah! But we are going to changeall that; it is high time!&rdquo;</p><p>He stared intently at Fantine, and added, once more taking into his graspJean Valjean&rsquo;s cravat, shirt and collar:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I tell you that there is no Monsieur Madeleine and that there is noMonsieur le Maire. There is a thief, a brigand, a convict named JeanValjean! And I have him in my grasp! That&rsquo;s what there is!&rdquo;</p><p>Fantine raised herself in bed with a bound, supporting herself on herstiffened arms and on both hands: she gazed at Jean Valjean, she gazed atJavert, she gazed at the nun, she opened her mouth as though to speak; arattle proceeded from the depths of her throat, her teeth chattered; shestretched out her arms in her agony, opening her hands convulsively, andfumbling about her like a drowning person; then suddenly fell back on herpillow.</p><p>Her head struck the head-board of the bed and fell forwards on her breast,with gaping mouth and staring, sightless eyes.</p><p>She was dead.</p><p>Jean Valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of Javert, and openedit as he would have opened the hand of a baby; then he said to Javert:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You have murdered that woman.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have an end of this!&rdquo; shouted Javert, in a fury; &ldquo;I am not here tolisten to argument. Let us economize all that; the guard is below; marchon instantly, or you&rsquo;ll get the thumb-screws!&rdquo;</p><p>In the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead, which was in adecidedly decrepit state, and which served the sisters as a camp-bed whenthey were watching with the sick. Jean Valjean stepped up to this bed, ina twinkling wrenched off the head-piece, which was already in adilapidated condition, an easy matter to muscles like his, grasped theprincipal rod like a bludgeon, and glanced at Javert. Javert retreatedtowards the door. Jean Valjean, armed with his bar of iron, walked slowlyup to Fantine&rsquo;s couch. When he arrived there he turned and said to Javert,in a voice that was barely audible:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I advise you not to disturb me at this moment.&rdquo;</p><p>One thing is certain, and that is, that Javert trembled.</p><p>It did occur to him to summon the guard, but Jean Valjean might availhimself of that moment to effect his escape; so he remained, grasped hiscane by the small end, and leaned against the door-post, without removinghis eyes from Jean Valjean.</p><p>Jean Valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed, and hisbrow on his hand, and began to contemplate the motionless body of Fantine,which lay extended there. He remained thus, mute, absorbed, evidently withno further thought of anything connected with this life. Upon his face andin his attitude there was nothing but inexpressible pity. After a fewmoments of this meditation he bent towards Fantine, and spoke to her in alow voice.</p><p>What did he say to her? What could this man, who was reproved, say to thatwoman, who was dead? What words were those? No one on earth heard them.Did the dead woman hear them? There are some touching illusions which are,perhaps, sublime realities. The point as to which there exists no doubtis, that Sister Simplice, the sole witness of the incident, often saidthat at the moment that Jean Valjean whispered in Fantine&rsquo;s ear, shedistinctly beheld an ineffable smile dawn on those pale lips, and in thosedim eyes, filled with the amazement of the tomb.</p><p>Jean Valjean took Fantine&rsquo;s head in both his hands, and arranged it on thepillow as a mother might have done for her child; then he tied the stringof her chemise, and smoothed her hair back under her cap. That done, heclosed her eyes.</p><p>Fantine&rsquo;s face seemed strangely illuminated at that moment.</p><p>Death, that signifies entrance into the great light.</p><p>Fantine&rsquo;s hand was hanging over the side of the bed. Jean Valjean kneltdown before that hand, lifted it gently, and kissed it.</p><p>Then he rose, and turned to Javert.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am at your disposal.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0070" id="link2HCH0070"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;A SUITABLE TOMB</h3><p>Javert deposited Jean Valjean in the city prison.</p><p>The arrest of M.

In less than two hours all the good that he had done hadbeen forgotten, and he was nothing but a &ldquo;convict from the galleys.&rdquo; It isjust to add that the details of what had taken place at Arras were not yetknown. All day long conversations like the following were to be heard inall quarters of the town:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know? He was a liberated convict!&rdquo; &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; &ldquo;The mayor.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bah!

I suspected as much. That man was toogood, too perfect, too affected. He refused the cross; he bestowed sous onall the little scamps he came across. I always thought there was some evilhistory back of all that.&rdquo;</p><p>The &ldquo;drawing-rooms&rdquo; particularly abounded in remarks of this nature.</p><p>One old lady, a subscriber to the <i>Drapeau Blanc</i>, made the followingremark, the depth of which it is impossible to fathom:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not sorry. It will be a lesson to the Bonapartists!&rdquo;</p><p>It was thus that the phantom which had been called M. Madeleine vanishedfrom M. sur M. Only three or four persons in all the town remainedfaithful to his memory. The old portress who had served him was among thenumber.</p><p>On the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her lodge,still in a thorough fright, and absorbed in sad reflections. The factoryhad been closed all day, the carriage gate was bolted, the street wasdeserted. There was no one in the house but the two nuns, Sister Perpétueand Sister Simplice, who were watching beside the body of Fantine.</p><p>Towards the hour when M. Madeleine was accustomed to return home, the goodportress rose mechanically, took from a drawer the key of M. Madeleine&rsquo;schamber, and the flat candlestick which he used every evening to go up tohis quarters; then she hung the key on the nail whence he was accustomedto take it, and set the candlestick on one side, as though she wasexpecting him. Then she sat down again on her chair, and became absorbedin thought once more. The poor, good old woman had done all this withoutbeing conscious of it.</p><p>It was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself fromher reverie, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Hold! My good God Jesus! And I hung his key onthe nail!&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment the small window in the lodge opened, a hand passedthrough, seized the key and the candlestick, and lighted the taper at thecandle which was burning there.</p><p>The portress raised her eyes, and stood there with gaping mouth, and ashriek which she confined to her throat.</p><p>She knew that hand, that arm, the sleeve of that coat.</p><p>It was M. Madeleine.</p><p>It was several seconds before she could speak; she had a <i>seizure</i>,as she said herself, when she related the adventure afterwards.</p><p>&ldquo;Good God, Monsieur le Maire,&rdquo; she cried at last, &ldquo;I thought you were&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>She stopped; the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking inrespect towards the beginning. Jean Valjean was still Monsieur le Maire toher.</p><p>He finished her thought.</p><p>&ldquo;In prison,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was there; I broke a bar of one of the windows; Ilet myself drop from the top of a roof, and here I am. I am going up to myroom; go and find Sister Simplice for me. She is with that poor woman, nodoubt.&rdquo;</p><p>The old woman obeyed in all haste.</p><p>He gave her no orders; he was quite sure that she would guard him betterthan he should guard himself.</p><p>No one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard withoutopening the big gates. He had, and always carried about him, a pass-keywhich opened a little side-door; but he must have been searched, and hislatch-key must have been taken from him. This point was never explained.</p><p>He ascended the staircase leading to his chamber. On arriving at the top,he left his candle on the top step of his stairs, opened his door withvery little noise, went and closed his window and his shutters by feeling,then returned for his candle and re-entered his room.</p><p>It was a useful precaution; it will be recollected that his window couldbe seen from the street.</p><p>He cast a glance about him, at his table, at his chair, at his bed whichhad not been disturbed for three days. No trace of the disorder of thenight before last remained. The portress had &ldquo;done up&rdquo; his room; only shehad picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the two ironends of the cudgel and the forty-sou piece which had been blackened by thefire.</p><p>He took a sheet of paper, on which he wrote: &ldquo;These are the two tips of myiron-shod cudgel and the forty-sou piece stolen from Little Gervais, whichI mentioned at the Court of Assizes,&rdquo; and he arranged this piece of paper,the bits of iron, and the coin in such a way that they were the firstthings to be seen on entering the room. From a cupboard he pulled out oneof his old shirts, which he tore in pieces. In the strips of linen thusprepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks. He betrayed neither hastenor agitation; and while he was wrapping up the Bishop&rsquo;s candlesticks, henibbled at a piece of black bread. It was probably the prison-bread whichhe had carried with him in his flight.</p><p>This was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the roomwhen the authorities made an examination later on.</p><p>There came two taps at the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>It was Sister Simplice.</p><p>She was pale; her eyes were red; the candle which she carried trembled inher hand. The peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is, thathowever polished or cool we may be, they wring human nature from our verybowels, and force it to reappear on the surface. The emotions of that dayhad turned the nun into a woman once more. She had wept, and she wastrembling.</p><p>Jean Valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper, which hehanded to the nun, saying, &ldquo;Sister, you will give this to Monsieur leCuré.&rdquo;</p><p>The paper was not folded. She cast a glance upon it.</p><p>&ldquo;You can read it,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>She read:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I beg Monsieur le Curé to keep an eye on all that I leave behind me. Hewill be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial, and of thefuneral of the woman who died yesterday. The rest is for the poor.&rdquo;</p><p>The sister tried to speak, but she only managed to stammer a fewinarticulate sounds. She succeeded in saying, however:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Does not Monsieur le Maire desire to take a last look at that poor,unhappy woman?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I am pursued; it would only end in their arresting me inthat room, and that would disturb her.&rdquo;</p><p>He had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on the staircase.They heard a tumult of ascending footsteps, and the old portress saying inher loudest and most piercing tones:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My good sir, I swear to you by the good God, that not a soul has enteredthis house all day, nor all the evening, and that I have not even left thedoor.&rdquo;</p><p>A man responded:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;But there is a light in that room, nevertheless.&rdquo;</p><p>They recognized Javert&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>The chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the corner ofthe wall on the right. Jean Valjean blew out the light and placed himselfin this angle. Sister Simplice fell on her knees near the table.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>Javert entered.</p><p>The whispers of many men and the protestations of the portress wereaudible in the corridor.</p><p>The nun did not raise her eyes. She was praying.</p><p>The candle was on the chimney-piece, and gave but very little light.</p><p>Javert caught sight of the nun and halted in amazement.</p><p>It will be remembered that the fundamental point in Javert, his element,the very air he breathed, was veneration for all authority. This wasimpregnable, and admitted of neither objection nor restriction. In hiseyes, of course, the ecclesiastical authority was the chief of all; he wasreligious, superficial and correct on this point as on all others. In hiseyes, a priest was a mind, who never makes a mistake; a nun was a creaturewho never sins; they were souls walled in from this world, with a singledoor which never opened except to allow the truth to pass through.</p><p>On perceiving the sister, his first movement was to retire.</p><p>But there was also another duty which bound him and impelled himimperiously in the opposite direction. His second movement was to remainand to venture on at least one question.</p><p>This was Sister Simplice, who had never told a lie in her life. Javertknew it, and held her in special veneration in consequence.</p><p>&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are you alone in this room?&rdquo;</p><p>A terrible moment ensued, during which the poor portress felt as thoughshe should faint.</p><p>The sister raised her eyes and answered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; resumed Javert, &ldquo;you will excuse me if I persist; it is my duty;you have not seen a certain person&mdash;a man&mdash;this evening? He hasescaped; we are in search of him&mdash;that Jean Valjean; you have notseen him?&rdquo;</p><p>The sister replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>She lied. She had lied twice in succession, one after the other, withouthesitation, promptly, as a person does when sacrificing herself.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Javert, and he retired with a deep bow.</p><p>O sainted maid! you left this world many years ago; you have rejoined yoursisters, the virgins, and your brothers, the angels, in the light; maythis lie be counted to your credit in paradise!</p><p>The sister&rsquo;s affirmation was for Javert so decisive a thing that he didnot even observe the singularity of that candle which had but just beenextinguished, and which was still smoking on the table.</p><p>An hour later, a man, marching amid trees and mists, was rapidly departingfrom M. sur M. in the direction of Paris. That man was Jean Valjean. Ithas been established by the testimony of two or three carters who met him,that he was carrying a bundle; that he was dressed in a blouse. Where hadhe obtained that blouse? No one ever found out. But an aged workman haddied in the infirmary of the factory a few days before, leaving behind himnothing but his blouse. Perhaps that was the one.</p><p>One last word about Fantine.</p><p>We all have a mother,&mdash;the earth. Fantine was given back to thatmother.</p><p>The curé thought that he was doing right, and perhaps he really was, inreserving as much money as possible from what Jean Valjean had left forthe poor. Who was concerned, after all? A convict and a woman of the town.That is why he had a very simple funeral for Fantine, and reduced it tothat strictly necessary form known as the pauper&rsquo;s grave.</p><p>So Fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongs toanybody and everybody, and where the poor are lost. Fortunately, God knowswhere to find the soul again. Fantine was laid in the shade, among thefirst bones that came to hand; she was subjected to the promiscuousness ofashes. She was thrown into the public grave. Her grave resembled her bed.</p><p>[THE END OF VOLUME I &ldquo;FANTINE&rdquo;]</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0013" id="linkimage-0013"></a><img src="images/2frontispiece.jpg" alt="Frontispiece Volume Two" width="100%" /></div><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0014" id="linkimage-0014"></a><img src="images/2titlepage.jpg" alt="Titlepage Volume Two" width="100%" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h2><a name="link2H_4_0083" id="link2H_4_0083"></a>VOLUME II<br />COSETTE</h2></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0084" id="link2H_4_0084"></a>BOOK FIRST&mdash;WATERLOO</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0071" id="link2HCH0071"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;WHAT IS MET WITH ON THE WAY FROM NIVELLES</h3><p>Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person whois telling this story, was coming from Nivelles, and directing his coursetowards La Hulpe. He was on foot. He was pursuing a broad paved road,which undulated between two rows of trees, over the hills which succeedeach other, raise the road and let it fall again, and produce something inthe nature of enormous waves.</p><p>He had passed Lillois and Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. In the west he perceivedthe slate-roofed tower of Braine-l&rsquo;Alleud, which has the form of areversed vase. He had just left behind a wood upon an eminence; and at theangle of the crossroad, by the side of a sort of mouldy gibbet bearingthe inscription <i>Ancient Barrier No. 4</i>, a public house, bearing onits front this sign: <i>At the Four Winds</i> (Aux Quatre Vents). <i>Échabeau,Private Café</i>.</p><p>A quarter of a league further on, he arrived at the bottom of a littlevalley, where there is water which passes beneath an arch made through theembankment of the road. The clump of sparsely planted but very greentrees, which fills the valley on one side of the road, is dispersed overthe meadows on the other, and disappears gracefully and as in order in thedirection of Braine-l&rsquo;Alleud.</p><p>On the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled cart atthe door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of dried brushwoodnear a flourishing hedge, lime smoking in a square hole, and a laddersuspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions. A young girl wasweeding in a field, where a huge yellow poster, probably of some outsidespectacle, such as a parish festival, was fluttering in the wind. At onecorner of the inn, beside a pool in which a flotilla of ducks wasnavigating, a badly paved path plunged into the bushes. The wayfarerstruck into this.</p><p>After traversing a hundred paces, skirting a wall of the fifteenthcentury, surmounted by a pointed gable, with bricks set in contrast, hefound himself before a large door of arched stone, with a rectilinearimpost, in the sombre style of Louis XIV., flanked by two flat medallions.A severe façade rose above this door; a wall, perpendicular to the façade,almost touched the door, and flanked it with an abrupt right angle. In themeadow before the door lay three harrows, through which, in disorder, grewall the flowers of May. The door was closed. The two decrepit leaves whichbarred it were ornamented with an old rusty knocker.</p><p>The sun was charming; the branches had that soft shivering of May, whichseems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind. A brave littlebird, probably a lover, was carolling in a distracted manner in a largetree.</p><p>The wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular excavation,resembling the hollow of a sphere, in the stone on the left, at the footof the pier of the door.</p><p>At this moment the leaves of the door parted, and a peasant woman emerged.</p><p>She saw the wayfarer, and perceived what he was looking at.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a French cannon-ball which made that,&rdquo; she said to him. And sheadded:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That which you see there, higher up in the door, near a nail, is the holeof a big iron bullet as large as an egg. The bullet did not pierce thewood.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is the name of this place?&rdquo; inquired the wayfarer.</p><p>&ldquo;Hougomont,&rdquo; said the peasant woman.</p><p>The traveller straightened himself up. He walked on a few paces, and wentoff to look over the tops of the hedges. On the horizon through the trees,he perceived a sort of little elevation, and on this elevation somethingwhich at that distance resembled a lion.</p><p>He was on the battle-field of Waterloo.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0072" id="link2HCH0072"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;HOUGOMONT</h3><p>Hougomont,&mdash;this was a funereal spot, the beginning of the obstacle,the first resistance, which that great wood-cutter of Europe, calledNapoleon, encountered at Waterloo, the first knot under the blows of hisaxe.</p><p>It was a château; it is no longer anything but a farm. For the antiquary,Hougomont is <i>Hugomons</i>. This manor was built by Hugo, Sire ofSomerel, the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the Abbey ofVilliers.</p><p>The traveller pushed open the door, elbowed an ancient calash under theporch, and entered the courtyard.</p><p>The first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of thesixteenth century, which here simulates an arcade, everything else havingfallen prostrate around it. A monumental aspect often has its birth inruin. In a wall near the arcade opens another arched door, of the time ofHenry IV., permitting a glimpse of the trees of an orchard; beside thisdoor, a manure-hole, some pickaxes, some shovels, some carts, an old well,with its flagstone and its iron reel, a chicken jumping, and a turkeyspreading its tail, a chapel surmounted by a small bell-tower, ablossoming pear-tree trained in espalier against the wall of the chapel&mdash;beholdthe court, the conquest of which was one of Napoleon&rsquo;s dreams. This cornerof earth, could he but have seized it, would, perhaps, have given him theworld likewise. Chickens are scattering its dust abroad with their beaks.A growl is audible; it is a huge dog, who shows his teeth and replaces theEnglish.</p><p>The English behaved admirably there. Cooke&rsquo;s four companies of guardsthere held out for seven hours against the fury of an army.</p><p>Hougomont viewed on the map, as a geometrical plan, comprising buildingsand enclosures, presents a sort of irregular rectangle, one angle of whichis nicked out. It is this angle which contains the southern door, guardedby this wall, which commands it only a gun&rsquo;s length away. Hougomont hastwo doors,&mdash;the southern door, that of the château; and the northerndoor, belonging to the farm. Napoleon sent his brother Jérôme againstHougomont; the divisions of Foy, Guilleminot, and Bachelu hurledthemselves against it; nearly the entire corps of Reille was employedagainst it, and miscarried; Kellermann&rsquo;s balls were exhausted on thisheroic section of wall. Bauduin&rsquo;s brigade was not strong enough to forceHougomont on the north, and the brigade of Soye could not do more thaneffect the beginning of a breach on the south, but without taking it.</p><p>The farm buildings border the courtyard on the south. A bit of the northdoor, broken by the French, hangs suspended to the wall. It consists offour planks nailed to two cross-beams, on which the scars of the attackare visible.</p><p>The northern door, which was beaten in by the French, and which has had apiece applied to it to replace the panel suspended on the wall, standshalf-open at the bottom of the paddock; it is cut squarely in the wall,built of stone below, of brick above which closes in the courtyard on thenorth. It is a simple door for carts, such as exist in all farms, with thetwo large leaves made of rustic planks: beyond lie the meadows. Thedispute over this entrance was furious. For a long time, all sorts ofimprints of bloody hands were visible on the door-posts. It was there thatBauduin was killed.</p><p>The storm of the combat still lingers in this courtyard; its horror isvisible there; the confusion of the fray was petrified there; it lives andit dies there; it was only yesterday. The walls are in the death agony,the stones fall; the breaches cry aloud; the holes are wounds; thedrooping, quivering trees seem to be making an effort to flee.</p><p>This courtyard was more built up in 1815 than it is to-day. Buildingswhich have since been pulled down then formed redans and angles.</p><p>The English barricaded themselves there; the French made their way in, butcould not stand their ground. Beside the chapel, one wing of the château,the only ruin now remaining of the manor of Hougomont, rises in acrumbling state,&mdash;disembowelled, one might say. The château servedfor a dungeon, the chapel for a block-house. There men exterminated eachother. The French, fired on from every point,&mdash;from behind the walls,from the summits of the garrets, from the depths of the cellars, throughall the casements, through all the air-holes, through every crack in thestones,&mdash;fetched fagots and set fire to walls and men; the reply tothe grape-shot was a conflagration.</p><p>In the ruined wing, through windows garnished with bars of iron, thedismantled chambers of the main building of brick are visible; the Englishguards were in ambush in these rooms; the spiral of the staircase, crackedfrom the ground floor to the very roof, appears like the inside of abroken shell. The staircase has two stories; the English, besieged on thestaircase, and massed on its upper steps, had cut off the lower steps.These consisted of large slabs of blue stone, which form a heap among thenettles. Half a score of steps still cling to the wall; on the first iscut the figure of a trident. These inaccessible steps are solid in theirniches. All the rest resembles a jaw which has been denuded of its teeth.There are two old trees there: one is dead; the other is wounded at itsbase, and is clothed with verdure in April. Since 1815 it has taken togrowing through the staircase.</p><p>A massacre took place in the chapel. The interior, which has recovered itscalm, is singular. The mass has not been said there since the carnage.Nevertheless, the altar has been left there&mdash;an altar of unpolishedwood, placed against a background of roughhewn stone. Four whitewashedwalls, a door opposite the altar, two small arched windows; over the doora large wooden crucifix, below the crucifix a square air-hole stopped upwith a bundle of hay; on the ground, in one corner, an old window-framewith the glass all broken to pieces&mdash;such is the chapel. Near thealtar there is nailed up a wooden statue of Saint Anne, of the fifteenthcentury; the head of the infant Jesus has been carried off by a largeball. The French, who were masters of the chapel for a moment, and werethen dislodged, set fire to it. The flames filled this building; it was aperfect furnace; the door was burned, the floor was burned, the woodenChrist was not burned. The fire preyed upon his feet, of which only theblackened stumps are now to be seen; then it stopped,&mdash;a miracle,according to the assertion of the people of the neighborhood. The infantJesus, decapitated, was less fortunate than the Christ.</p><p>The walls are covered with inscriptions. Near the feet of Christ this nameis to be read: <i>Henquinez</i>. Then these others: <i>Conde de Rio MaiorMarques y Marquesa de Almagro (Habana)</i>. There are French names withexclamation points,&mdash;a sign of wrath. The wall was freshlywhitewashed in 1849. The nations insulted each other there.</p><p>It was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up which heldan axe in its hand; this corpse was Sub-Lieutenant Legros.</p><p>On emerging from the chapel, a well is visible on the left. There are twoin this courtyard. One inquires, Why is there no bucket and pulley tothis? It is because water is no longer drawn there. Why is water not drawnthere? Because it is full of skeletons.</p><p>The last person who drew water from the well was named Guillaume vanKylsom. He was a peasant who lived at Hougomont, and was gardener there.On the 18th of June, 1815, his family fled and concealed themselves in thewoods.</p><p>The forest surrounding the Abbey of Villiers sheltered these unfortunatepeople who had been scattered abroad, for many days and nights. There areat this day certain traces recognizable, such as old boles of burnedtrees, which mark the site of these poor bivouacs trembling in the depthsof the thickets.</p><p>Guillaume van Kylsom remained at Hougomont, &ldquo;to guard the château,&rdquo; andconcealed himself in the cellar. The English discovered him there. Theytore him from his hiding-place, and the combatants forced this frightenedman to serve them, by administering blows with the flats of their swords.They were thirsty; this Guillaume brought them water. It was from thiswell that he drew it. Many drank there their last draught. This well wheredrank so many of the dead was destined to die itself.</p><p>After the engagement, they were in haste to bury the dead bodies. Deathhas a fashion of harassing victory, and she causes the pest to followglory. The typhus is a concomitant of triumph. This well was deep, and itwas turned into a sepulchre. Three hundred dead bodies were cast into it.With too much haste perhaps. Were they all dead? Legend says they werenot. It seems that on the night succeeding the interment, feeble voiceswere heard calling from the well.</p><p>This well is isolated in the middle of the courtyard. Three walls, partstone, part brick, and simulating a small, square tower, and folded likethe leaves of a screen, surround it on all sides. The fourth side is open.It is there that the water was drawn. The wall at the bottom has a sort ofshapeless loophole, possibly the hole made by a shell. This little towerhad a platform, of which only the beams remain. The iron supports of thewell on the right form a cross. On leaning over, the eye is lost in a deepcylinder of brick which is filled with a heaped-up mass of shadows. Thebase of the walls all about the well is concealed in a growth of nettles.</p><p>This well has not in front of it that large blue slab which forms thetable for all wells in Belgium. The slab has here been replaced by across-beam, against which lean five or six shapeless fragments of knottyand petrified wood which resemble huge bones. There is no longer eitherpail, chain, or pulley; but there is still the stone basin which servedthe overflow. The rain-water collects there, and from time to time a birdof the neighboring forests comes thither to drink, and then flies away.One house in this ruin, the farmhouse, is still inhabited. The door ofthis house opens on the courtyard. Upon this door, beside a pretty Gothiclock-plate, there is an iron handle with trefoils placed slanting. At themoment when the Hanoverian lieutenant, Wilda, grasped this handle in orderto take refuge in the farm, a French sapper hewed off his hand with anaxe.</p><p>The family who occupy the house had for their grandfather Guillaume vanKylsom, the old gardener, dead long since. A woman with gray hair said tous: &ldquo;I was there. I was three years old. My sister, who was older, wasterrified and wept. They carried us off to the woods. I went there in mymother&rsquo;s arms. We glued our ears to the earth to hear. I imitated thecannon, and went <i>boum! boum!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>A door opening from the courtyard on the left led into the orchard, so wewere told. The orchard is terrible.</p><p>It is in three parts; one might almost say, in three acts. The first partis a garden, the second is an orchard, the third is a wood. These threeparts have a common enclosure: on the side of the entrance, the buildingsof the château and the farm; on the left, a hedge; on the right, a wall;and at the end, a wall. The wall on the right is of brick, the wall at thebottom is of stone. One enters the garden first. It slopes downwards, isplanted with gooseberry bushes, choked with a wild growth of vegetation,and terminated by a monumental terrace of cut stone, with balustrade witha double curve.</p><p>It was a seignorial garden in the first French style which preceded LeNôtre; to-day it is ruins and briars. The pilasters are surmounted byglobes which resemble cannon-balls of stone. Forty-three balusters canstill be counted on their sockets; the rest lie prostrate in the grass.Almost all bear scratches of bullets. One broken baluster is placed on thepediment like a fractured leg.</p><p>It was in this garden, further down than the orchard, that sixlight-infantry men of the 1st, having made their way thither, and beingunable to escape, hunted down and caught like bears in their dens,accepted the combat with two Hanoverian companies, one of which was armedwith carbines. The Hanoverians lined this balustrade and fired from above.The infantry men, replying from below, six against two hundred, intrepidand with no shelter save the currant-bushes, took a quarter of an hour todie.</p><p>One mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard,properly speaking. There, within the limits of those few square fathoms,fifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour. The wall seems ready torenew the combat. Thirty-eight loopholes, pierced by the English atirregular heights, are there still. In front of the sixth are placed twoEnglish tombs of granite. There are loopholes only in the south wall, asthe principal attack came from that quarter. The wall is hidden on theoutside by a tall hedge; the French came up, thinking that they had todeal only with a hedge, crossed it, and found the wall both an obstacleand an ambuscade, with the English guards behind it, the thirty-eightloopholes firing at once a shower of grape-shot and balls, and Soye&rsquo;sbrigade was broken against it. Thus Waterloo began.</p><p>Nevertheless, the orchard was taken. As they had no ladders, the Frenchscaled it with their nails. They fought hand to hand amid the trees. Allthis grass has been soaked in blood. A battalion of Nassau, seven hundredstrong, was overwhelmed there. The outside of the wall, against whichKellermann&rsquo;s two batteries were trained, is gnawed by grape-shot.</p><p>This orchard is sentient, like others, in the month of May. It has itsbuttercups and its daisies; the grass is tall there; the cart-horsesbrowse there; cords of hair, on which linen is drying, traverse the spacesbetween the trees and force the passer-by to bend his head; one walks overthis uncultivated land, and one&rsquo;s foot dives into mole-holes. In themiddle of the grass one observes an uprooted tree-bole which lies thereall verdant. Major Blackmann leaned against it to die. Beneath a greattree in the neighborhood fell the German general, Duplat, descended from aFrench family which fled on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. An agedand falling apple-tree leans far over to one side, its wound dressed witha bandage of straw and of clayey loam. Nearly all the apple-trees arefalling with age. There is not one which has not had its bullet or itsbiscayan.<a href="#linknote-6" name="linknoteref-6" id="linknoteref-6">6</a>The skeletons of dead trees abound in this orchard. Crows fly throughtheir branches, and at the end of it is a wood full of violets.</p><p>Bauduin killed, Foy wounded, conflagration, massacre, carnage, a rivuletformed of English blood, French blood, German blood mingled in fury, awell crammed with corpses, the regiment of Nassau and the regiment ofBrunswick destroyed, Duplat killed, Blackmann killed, the English Guardsmutilated, twenty French battalions, besides the forty from Reille&rsquo;scorps, decimated, three thousand men in that hovel of Hougomont alone cutdown, slashed to pieces, shot, burned, with their throats cut,&mdash;andall this so that a peasant can say to-day to the traveller: <i>Monsieur,give me three francs, and if you like, I will explain to you the affair ofWaterloo!</i></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0073" id="link2HCH0073"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE EIGHTEENTH OF JUNE, 1815</h3><p>Let us turn back,&mdash;that is one of the story-teller&rsquo;s rights,&mdash;andput ourselves once more in the year 1815, and even a little earlier thanthe epoch when the action narrated in the first part of this book tookplace.</p><p>If it had not rained in the night between the 17th and the 18th of June,1815, the fate of Europe would have been different. A few drops of water,more or less, decided the downfall of Napoleon. All that Providencerequired in order to make Waterloo the end of Austerlitz was a little morerain, and a cloud traversing the sky out of season sufficed to make aworld crumble.</p><p>The battle of Waterloo could not be begun until half-past eleven o&rsquo;clock,and that gave Blücher time to come up. Why? Because the ground was wet.The artillery had to wait until it became a little firmer before theycould manœuvre.</p><p>Napoleon was an artillery officer, and felt the effects of this. Thefoundation of this wonderful captain was the man who, in the report to theDirectory on Aboukir, said: <i>Such a one of our balls killed six men</i>.All his plans of battle were arranged for projectiles. The key to hisvictory was to make the artillery converge on one point. He treated thestrategy of the hostile general like a citadel, and made a breach in it.He overwhelmed the weak point with grape-shot; he joined and dissolvedbattles with cannon. There was something of the sharpshooter in hisgenius. To beat in squares, to pulverize regiments, to break lines, tocrush and disperse masses,&mdash;for him everything lay in this, tostrike, strike, strike incessantly,&mdash;and he intrusted this task tothe cannon-ball. A redoubtable method, and one which, united with genius,rendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for thespace of fifteen years.</p><p>On the 18th of June, 1815, he relied all the more on his artillery,because he had numbers on his side. Wellington had only one hundred andfifty-nine mouths of fire; Napoleon had two hundred and forty.</p><p>Suppose the soil dry, and the artillery capable of moving, the actionwould have begun at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The battle would have beenwon and ended at two o&rsquo;clock, three hours before the change of fortune infavor of the Prussians. What amount of blame attaches to Napoleon for theloss of this battle? Is the shipwreck due to the pilot?</p><p>Was it the evident physical decline of Napoleon that complicated thisepoch by an inward diminution of force? Had the twenty years of war wornout the blade as it had worn the scabbard, the soul as well as the body?Did the veteran make himself disastrously felt in the leader? In a word,was this genius, as many historians of note have thought, suffering froman eclipse? Did he go into a frenzy in order to disguise his weakenedpowers from himself? Did he begin to waver under the delusion of a breathof adventure? Had he become&mdash;a grave matter in a general&mdash;unconsciousof peril? Is there an age, in this class of material great men, who may becalled the giants of action, when genius grows short-sighted? Old age hasno hold on the geniuses of the ideal; for the Dantes and Michael Angelosto grow old is to grow in greatness; is it to grow less for the Hannibalsand the Bonapartes? Had Napoleon lost the direct sense of victory? Had hereached the point where he could no longer recognize the reef, could nolonger divine the snare, no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses?Had he lost his power of scenting out catastrophes? He who had in formerdays known all the roads to triumph, and who, from the summit of hischariot of lightning, pointed them out with a sovereign finger, had he nowreached that state of sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuouslegions harnessed to it, to the precipice? Was he seized at the age offorty-six with a supreme madness? Was that titanic charioteer of destinyno longer anything more than an immense dare-devil?</p><p>We do not think so.</p><p>His plan of battle was, by the confession of all, a masterpiece. To gostraight to the centre of the Allies&rsquo; line, to make a breach in the enemy,to cut them in two, to drive the British half back on Hal, and thePrussian half on Tongres, to make two shattered fragments of Wellingtonand Blücher, to carry Mont-Saint-Jean, to seize Brussels, to hurl theGerman into the Rhine, and the Englishman into the sea. All this wascontained in that battle, according to Napoleon. Afterwards people wouldsee.</p><p>Of course, we do not here pretend to furnish a history of the battle ofWaterloo; one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which we arerelating is connected with this battle, but this history is not oursubject; this history, moreover, has been finished, and finished in amasterly manner, from one point of view by Napoleon, and from anotherpoint of view by a whole pleiad of historians.<a href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7">7</a></p><p>As for us, we leave the historians at loggerheads; we are but a distantwitness, a passer-by on the plain, a seeker bending over that soil allmade of human flesh, taking appearances for realities, perchance; we haveno right to oppose, in the name of science, a collection of facts whichcontain illusions, no doubt; we possess neither military practice norstrategic ability which authorize a system; in our opinion, a chain ofaccidents dominated the two leaders at Waterloo; and when it becomes aquestion of destiny, that mysterious culprit, we judge like that ingeniousjudge, the populace.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0074" id="link2HCH0074"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;A</h3><p>Those persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of Waterloo haveonly to place, mentally, on the ground, a capital A. The left limb of theA is the road to Nivelles, the right limb is the road to Genappe, the tieof the A is the hollow road to Ohain from Braine-l&rsquo;Alleud. The top of theA is Mont-Saint-Jean, where Wellington is; the lower left tip isHougomont, where Reille is stationed with Jérôme Bonaparte; the right tipis the Belle-Alliance, where Napoleon was. At the centre of this chord isthe precise point where the final word of the battle was pronounced. Itwas there that the lion has been placed, the involuntary symbol of thesupreme heroism of the Imperial Guard.</p><p>The triangle included in the top of the A, between the two limbs and thetie, is the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. The dispute over this plateauconstituted the whole battle. The wings of the two armies extended to theright and left of the two roads to Genappe and Nivelles; d&rsquo;Erlon facingPicton, Reille facing Hill.</p><p>Behind the tip of the A, behind the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, is theforest of Soignes.</p><p>As for the plain itself, let the reader picture to himself a vastundulating sweep of ground; each rise commands the next rise, and all theundulations mount towards Mont-Saint-Jean, and there end in the forest.</p><p>Two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers. It is aquestion of seizing the opponent round the waist. The one seeks to trip upthe other. They clutch at everything: a bush is a point of support; anangle of the wall offers them a rest to the shoulder; for the lack of ahovel under whose cover they can draw up, a regiment yields its ground; anunevenness in the ground, a chance turn in the landscape, a cross-pathencountered at the right moment, a grove, a ravine, can stay the heel ofthat colossus which is called an army, and prevent its retreat. He whoquits the field is beaten; hence the necessity devolving on theresponsible leader, of examining the most insignificant clump of trees,and of studying deeply the slightest relief in the ground.</p><p>The two generals had attentively studied the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean, nowcalled the plain of Waterloo. In the preceding year, Wellington, with thesagacity of foresight, had examined it as the possible seat of a greatbattle. Upon this spot, and for this duel, on the 18th of June, Wellingtonhad the good post, Napoleon the bad post. The English army was stationedabove, the French army below.</p><p>It is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of Napoleon onhorseback, glass in hand, upon the heights of Rossomme, at daybreak, onJune 18, 1815. All the world has seen him before we can show him. Thatcalm profile under the little three-cornered hat of the school of Brienne,that green uniform, the white revers concealing the star of the Legion ofHonor, his great coat hiding his epaulets, the corner of red ribbonpeeping from beneath his vest, his leather trousers, the white horse withthe saddle-cloth of purple velvet bearing on the corners crowned N&rsquo;s andeagles, Hessian boots over silk stockings, silver spurs, the sword ofMarengo,&mdash;that whole figure of the last of the Cæsars is present toall imaginations, saluted with acclamations by some, severely regarded byothers.</p><p>That figure stood for a long time wholly in the light; this arose from acertain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes, and whichalways veils the truth for a longer or shorter time; but to-day historyand daylight have arrived.</p><p>That light called history is pitiless; it possesses this peculiar anddivine quality, that, pure light as it is, and precisely because it iswholly light, it often casts a shadow in places where people had hithertobeheld rays; from the same man it constructs two different phantoms, andthe one attacks the other and executes justice on it, and the shadows ofthe despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader. Hence arises a truermeasure in the definitive judgments of nations. Babylon violated lessensAlexander, Rome enchained lessens Cæsar, Jerusalem murdered lessens Titus,tyranny follows the tyrant. It is a misfortune for a man to leave behindhim the night which bears his form.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0075" id="link2HCH0075"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;THE QUID OBSCURUM OF BATTLES</h3><p>Every one is acquainted with the first phase of this battle; a beginningwhich was troubled, uncertain, hesitating, menacing to both armies, butstill more so for the English than for the French.</p><p>It had rained all night, the earth had been cut up by the downpour, thewater had accumulated here and there in the hollows of the plain as if incasks; at some points the gear of the artillery carriages was buried up tothe axles, the circingles of the horses were dripping with liquid mud. Ifthe wheat and rye trampled down by this cohort of transports on the marchhad not filled in the ruts and strewn a litter beneath the wheels, allmovement, particularly in the valleys, in the direction of Papelotte wouldhave been impossible.</p><p>The affair began late. Napoleon, as we have already explained, was in thehabit of keeping all his artillery well in hand, like a pistol, aiming itnow at one point, now at another, of the battle; and it had been his wishto wait until the horse batteries could move and gallop freely. In orderto do that it was necessary that the sun should come out and dry the soil.But the sun did not make its appearance. It was no longer the rendezvousof Austerlitz. When the first cannon was fired, the English general,Colville, looked at his watch, and noted that it was thirty-five minutespast eleven.</p><p>The action was begun furiously, with more fury, perhaps, than the Emperorwould have wished, by the left wing of the French resting on Hougomont. Atthe same time Napoleon attacked the centre by hurling Quiot&rsquo;s brigade onLa Haie-Sainte, and Ney pushed forward the right wing of the Frenchagainst the left wing of the English, which rested on Papelotte.</p><p>The attack on Hougomont was something of a feint; the plan was to drawWellington thither, and to make him swerve to the left. This plan wouldhave succeeded if the four companies of the English guards and the braveBelgians of Perponcher&rsquo;s division had not held the position solidly, andWellington, instead of massing his troops there, could confine himself todespatching thither, as reinforcements, only four more companies of guardsand one battalion from Brunswick.</p><p>The attack of the right wing of the French on Papelotte was calculated, infact, to overthrow the English left, to cut off the road to Brussels, tobar the passage against possible Prussians, to force Mont-Saint-Jean, toturn Wellington back on Hougomont, thence on Braine-l&rsquo;Alleud, thence onHal; nothing easier. With the exception of a few incidents this attacksucceeded. Papelotte was taken; La Haie-Sainte was carried.</p><p>A detail to be noted. There was in the English infantry, particularly inKempt&rsquo;s brigade, a great many raw recruits. These young soldiers werevaliant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry; their inexperienceextricated them intrepidly from the dilemma; they performed particularlyexcellent service as skirmishers: the soldier skirmisher, left somewhat tohimself, becomes, so to speak, his own general. These recruits displayedsome of the French ingenuity and fury. This novice of an infantry haddash. This displeased Wellington.</p><p>After the taking of La Haie-Sainte the battle wavered.</p><p>There is in this day an obscure interval, from midday to four o&rsquo;clock;the middle portion of this battle is almost indistinct, and participatesin the sombreness of the hand-to-hand conflict. Twilight reigns over it.We perceive vast fluctuations in that fog, a dizzy mirage, paraphernaliaof war almost unknown to-day, pendant colbacks, floating sabre-taches,cross-belts, cartridge-boxes for grenades, hussar dolmans, red boots witha thousand wrinkles, heavy shakos garlanded with torsades, the almostblack infantry of Brunswick mingled with the scarlet infantry of England,the English soldiers with great, white circular pads on the slopes oftheir shoulders for epaulets, the Hanoverian light-horse with their oblongcasques of leather, with brass hands and red horse-tails, the Scotch withtheir bare knees and plaids, the great white gaiters of our grenadiers;pictures, not strategic lines&mdash;what Salvator Rosa requires, not whatis suited to the needs of Gribeauval.</p><p>A certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle. <i>Quidobscurum, quid divinum</i>. Each historian traces, to some extent, theparticular feature which pleases him amid this pell-mell. Whatever may bethe combinations of the generals, the shock of armed masses has anincalculable ebb. During the action the plans of the two leaders enterinto each other and become mutually thrown out of shape. Such a point ofthe field of battle devours more combatants than such another, just asmore or less spongy soils soak up more or less quickly the water which ispoured on them. It becomes necessary to pour out more soldiers than onewould like; a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen. The line ofbattle waves and undulates like a thread, the trails of blood gushillogically, the fronts of the armies waver, the regiments form capes andgulfs as they enter and withdraw; all these reefs are continually movingin front of each other. Where the infantry stood the artillery arrives,the cavalry rushes in where the artillery was, the battalions are likesmoke. There was something there; seek it. It has disappeared; the openspots change place, the sombre folds advance and retreat, a sort of windfrom the sepulchre pushes forward, hurls back, distends, and dispersesthese tragic multitudes. What is a fray? an oscillation? The immobility ofa mathematical plan expresses a minute, not a day. In order to depict abattle, there is required one of those powerful painters who have chaos intheir brushes. Rembrandt is better than Vandermeulen; Vandermeulen, exactat noon, lies at three o&rsquo;clock. Geometry is deceptive; the hurricane aloneis trustworthy. That is what confers on Folard the right to contradictPolybius. Let us add, that there is a certain instant when the battledegenerates into a combat, becomes specialized, and disperses intoinnumerable detailed feats, which, to borrow the expression of Napoleonhimself, &ldquo;belong rather to the biography of the regiments than to thehistory of the army.&rdquo; The historian has, in this case, the evident rightto sum up the whole. He cannot do more than seize the principal outlinesof the struggle, and it is not given to any one narrator, howeverconscientious he may be, to fix, absolutely, the form of that horriblecloud which is called a battle.</p><p>This, which is true of all great armed encounters, is particularlyapplicable to Waterloo.</p><p>Nevertheless, at a certain moment in the afternoon the battle came to apoint.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0076" id="link2HCH0076"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;FOUR O&rsquo;CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON</h3><p>Towards four o&rsquo;clock the condition of the English army was serious. ThePrince of Orange was in command of the centre, Hill of the right wing,Picton of the left wing. The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid,shouted to the Hollando-Belgians: &ldquo;Nassau! Brunswick! Never retreat!&rdquo; Hill, having been weakened, had come up to the support of Wellington;Picton was dead. At the very moment when the English had captured from theFrench the flag of the 105th of the line, the French had killed theEnglish general, Picton, with a bullet through the head. The battle had,for Wellington, two bases of action, Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte;Hougomont still held out, but was on fire; La Haie-Sainte was taken. Ofthe German battalion which defended it, only forty-two men survived; allthe officers, except five, were either dead or captured. Three thousandcombatants had been massacred in that barn. A sergeant of the EnglishGuards, the foremost boxer in England, reputed invulnerable by hiscompanions, had been killed there by a little French drummer-boy. Baringhad been dislodged, Alten put to the sword. Many flags had been lost, onefrom Alten&rsquo;s division, and one from the battalion of Lunenburg, carried bya prince of the house of Deux-Ponts. The Scotch Grays no longer existed;Ponsonby&rsquo;s great dragoons had been hacked to pieces. That valiant cavalryhad bent beneath the lancers of Bro and beneath the cuirassiers ofTravers; out of twelve hundred horses, six hundred remained; out of threelieutenant-colonels, two lay on the earth,&mdash;Hamilton wounded, Materslain. Ponsonby had fallen, riddled by seven lance-thrusts. Gordon wasdead. Marsh was dead. Two divisions, the fifth and the sixth, had beenannihilated.</p><p>Hougomont injured, La Haie-Sainte taken, there now existed but onerallying-point, the centre. That point still held firm. Wellingtonreinforced it. He summoned thither Hill, who was at Merle-Braine; hesummoned Chassé, who was at Braine-l&rsquo;Alleud.</p><p>The centre of the English army, rather concave, very dense, and verycompact, was strongly posted. It occupied the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean,having behind it the village, and in front of it the slope, which wastolerably steep then. It rested on that stout stone dwelling which at thattime belonged to the domain of Nivelles, and which marks the intersectionof the roads&mdash;a pile of the sixteenth century, and so robust that thecannon-balls rebounded from it without injuring it. All about the plateauthe English had cut the hedges here and there, made embrasures in thehawthorn-trees, thrust the throat of a cannon between two branches,embattled the shrubs. There artillery was ambushed in the brushwood. Thispunic labor, incontestably authorized by war, which permits traps, was sowell done, that Haxo, who had been despatched by the Emperor at nineo&rsquo;clock in the morning to reconnoitre the enemy&rsquo;s batteries, haddiscovered nothing of it, and had returned and reported to Napoleon thatthere were no obstacles except the two barricades which barred the road toNivelles and to Genappe. It was at the season when the grain is tall; onthe edge of the plateau a battalion of Kempt&rsquo;s brigade, the 95th, armedwith carabines, was concealed in the tall wheat.</p><p>Thus assured and buttressed, the centre of the Anglo-Dutch army was wellposted. The peril of this position lay in the forest of Soignes, thenadjoining the field of battle, and intersected by the ponds of Groenendaeland Boitsfort. An army could not retreat thither without dissolving; theregiments would have broken up immediately there. The artillery would havebeen lost among the morasses. The retreat, according to many a man versedin the art,&mdash;though it is disputed by others,&mdash;would have been adisorganized flight.</p><p>To this centre, Wellington added one of Chassé&rsquo;s brigades taken from theright wing, and one of Wincke&rsquo;s brigades taken from the left wing, plusClinton&rsquo;s division. To his English, to the regiments of Halkett, to thebrigades of Mitchell, to the guards of Maitland, he gave as reinforcementsand aids, the infantry of Brunswick, Nassau&rsquo;s contingent, Kielmansegg&rsquo;sHanoverians, and Ompteda&rsquo;s Germans. This placed twenty-six battalionsunder his hand. <i>The right wing</i>, as Charras says, <i>was thrown backon the centre</i>. An enormous battery was masked by sacks of earth at thespot where there now stands what is called the &ldquo;Museum of Waterloo.&rdquo; Besides this, Wellington had, behind a rise in the ground, Somerset&rsquo;sDragoon Guards, fourteen hundred horse strong. It was the remaining halfof the justly celebrated English cavalry. Ponsonby destroyed, Somersetremained.</p><p>The battery, which, if completed, would have been almost a redoubt, wasranged behind a very low garden wall, backed up with a coating of bags ofsand and a large slope of earth. This work was not finished; there hadbeen no time to make a palisade for it.</p><p>Wellington, uneasy but impassive, was on horseback, and there remained thewhole day in the same attitude, a little in advance of the old mill ofMont-Saint-Jean, which is still in existence, beneath an elm, which anEnglishman, an enthusiastic vandal, purchased later on for two hundredfrancs, cut down, and carried off. Wellington was coldly heroic. Thebullets rained about him. His aide-de-camp, Gordon, fell at his side. LordHill, pointing to a shell which had burst, said to him: &ldquo;My lord, what areyour orders in case you are killed?&rdquo; &ldquo;To do like me,&rdquo; replied Wellington.To Clinton he said laconically, &ldquo;To hold this spot to the last man.&rdquo; Theday was evidently turning out ill. Wellington shouted to his oldcompanions of Talavera, of Vittoria, of Salamanca: &ldquo;Boys, can retreat bethought of? Think of old England!&rdquo;</p><p>Towards four o&rsquo;clock, the English line drew back. Suddenly nothing wasvisible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and thesharpshooters; the rest had disappeared: the regiments, dislodged by theshells and the French bullets, retreated into the bottom, now intersectedby the back road of the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean; a retrograde movementtook place, the English front hid itself, Wellington drew back. &ldquo;Thebeginning of retreat!&rdquo; cried Napoleon.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0077" id="link2HCH0077"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;NAPOLEON IN A GOOD HUMOR</h3><p>The Emperor, though ill and discommoded on horseback by a local trouble,had never been in a better humor than on that day. His impenetrability hadbeen smiling ever since the morning. On the 18th of June, that profoundsoul masked by marble beamed blindly. The man who had been gloomy atAusterlitz was gay at Waterloo. The greatest favorites of destiny makemistakes. Our joys are composed of shadow. The supreme smile is God&rsquo;salone.</p><p><i>Ridet Cæsar, Pompeius flebit</i>, said the legionaries of theFulminatrix Legion. Pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion, butit is certain that Cæsar laughed. While exploring on horseback at oneo&rsquo;clock on the preceding night, in storm and rain, in company withBertrand, the communes in the neighborhood of Rossomme, satisfied at thesight of the long line of the English camp-fires illuminating the wholehorizon from Frischemont to Braine-l&rsquo;Alleud, it had seemed to him thatfate, to whom he had assigned a day on the field of Waterloo, was exact tothe appointment; he stopped his horse, and remained for some timemotionless, gazing at the lightning and listening to the thunder; and thisfatalist was heard to cast into the darkness this mysterious saying, &ldquo;Weare in accord.&rdquo; Napoleon was mistaken. They were no longer in accord.</p><p>He took not a moment for sleep; every instant of that night was marked bya joy for him. He traversed the line of the principal outposts, haltinghere and there to talk to the sentinels. At half-past two, near the woodof Hougomont, he heard the tread of a column on the march; he thought atthe moment that it was a retreat on the part of Wellington. He said: &ldquo;Itis the rear-guard of the English getting under way for the purpose ofdecamping. I will take prisoners the six thousand English who have justarrived at Ostend.&rdquo; He conversed expansively; he regained the animationwhich he had shown at his landing on the first of March, when he pointedout to the Grand-Marshal the enthusiastic peasant of the Gulf Juan, andcried, &ldquo;Well, Bertrand, here is a reinforcement already!&rdquo; On the night ofthe 17th to the 18th of June he rallied Wellington. &ldquo;That littleEnglishman needs a lesson,&rdquo; said Napoleon. The rain redoubled in violence;the thunder rolled while the Emperor was speaking.</p><p>At half-past three o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he lost one illusion; officerswho had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him that the enemy wasnot making any movement. Nothing was stirring; not a bivouac-fire had beenextinguished; the English army was asleep. The silence on earth wasprofound; the only noise was in the heavens. At four o&rsquo;clock, a peasantwas brought in to him by the scouts; this peasant had served as guide to abrigade of English cavalry, probably Vivian&rsquo;s brigade, which was on itsway to take up a position in the village of Ohain, at the extreme left. Atfive o&rsquo;clock, two Belgian deserters reported to him that they had justquitted their regiment, and that the English army was ready for battle.&ldquo;So much the better!&rdquo; exclaimed Napoleon. &ldquo;I prefer to overthrow themrather than to drive them back.&rdquo;</p><p>In the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which forms an anglewith the Plancenoit road, had a kitchen table and a peasant&rsquo;s chairbrought to him from the farm of Rossomme, seated himself, with a truss ofstraw for a carpet, and spread out on the table the chart of thebattle-field, saying to Soult as he did so, &ldquo;A pretty checker-board.&rdquo;</p><p>In consequence of the rains during the night, the transports ofprovisions, embedded in the soft roads, had not been able to arrive bymorning; the soldiers had had no sleep; they were wet and fasting. Thisdid not prevent Napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to Ney, &ldquo;We haveninety chances out of a hundred.&rdquo; At eight o&rsquo;clock the Emperor&rsquo;s breakfastwas brought to him. He invited many generals to it. During breakfast, itwas said that Wellington had been to a ball two nights before, inBrussels, at the Duchess of Richmond&rsquo;s; and Soult, a rough man of war,with a face of an archbishop, said, &ldquo;The ball takes place to-day.&rdquo; TheEmperor jested with Ney, who said, &ldquo;Wellington will not be so simple as towait for Your Majesty.&rdquo; That was his way, however. &ldquo;He was fond ofjesting,&rdquo; says Fleury de Chaboulon. &ldquo;A merry humor was at the foundationof his character,&rdquo; says Gourgaud. &ldquo;He abounded in pleasantries, which weremore peculiar than witty,&rdquo; says Benjamin Constant. These gayeties of agiant are worthy of insistence. It was he who called his grenadiers &ldquo;hisgrumblers&rdquo;; he pinched their ears; he pulled their moustaches. &ldquo;The Emperordid nothing but play pranks on us,&rdquo; is the remark of one of them. Duringthe mysterious trip from the island of Elba to France, on the 27th ofFebruary, on the open sea, the French brig of war, <i>Le Zéphyr</i>,having encountered the brig <i>L&rsquo;Inconstant</i>, on which Napoleon wasconcealed, and having asked the news of Napoleon from <i>L&rsquo;Inconstant</i>,the Emperor, who still wore in his hat the white and amaranthine cockadesown with bees, which he had adopted at the isle of Elba, laughinglyseized the speaking-trumpet, and answered for himself, &ldquo;The Emperor iswell.&rdquo; A man who laughs like that is on familiar terms with events.Napoleon indulged in many fits of this laughter during the breakfast atWaterloo. After breakfast he meditated for a quarter of an hour; then twogenerals seated themselves on the truss of straw, pen in hand and theirpaper on their knees, and the Emperor dictated to them the order ofbattle.</p><p>At nine o&rsquo;clock, at the instant when the French army, ranged in echelonsand set in motion in five columns, had deployed&mdash;the divisions in twolines, the artillery between the brigades, the music at their head; asthey beat the march, with rolls on the drums and the blasts of trumpets,mighty, vast, joyous, a sea of casques, of sabres, and of bayonets on thehorizon, the Emperor was touched, and twice exclaimed, &ldquo;Magnificent!Magnificent!&rdquo;</p><p>Between nine o&rsquo;clock and half-past ten the whole army, incredible as itmay appear, had taken up its position and ranged itself in six lines,forming, to repeat the Emperor&rsquo;s expression, &ldquo;the figure of six V&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Afew moments after the formation of the battle-array, in the midst of thatprofound silence, like that which heralds the beginning of a storm, whichprecedes engagements, the Emperor tapped Haxo on the shoulder, as hebeheld the three batteries of twelve-pounders, detached by his orders fromthe corps of Erlon, Reille, and Lobau, and destined to begin the action bytaking Mont-Saint-Jean, which was situated at the intersection of theNivelles and the Genappe roads, and said to him, &ldquo;There are four andtwenty handsome maids, General.&rdquo;</p><p>Sure of the issue, he encouraged with a smile, as they passed before him,the company of sappers of the first corps, which he had appointed tobarricade Mont-Saint-Jean as soon as the village should be carried. Allthis serenity had been traversed by but a single word of haughty pity;perceiving on his left, at a spot where there now stands a large tomb,those admirable Scotch Grays, with their superb horses, massingthemselves, he said, &ldquo;It is a pity.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he mounted his horse, advanced beyond Rossomme, and selected for hispost of observation a contracted elevation of turf to the right of theroad from Genappe to Brussels, which was his second station during thebattle. The third station, the one adopted at seven o&rsquo;clock in theevening, between La Belle-Alliance and La Haie-Sainte, is formidable; itis a rather elevated knoll, which still exists, and behind which the guardwas massed on a slope of the plain. Around this knoll the balls reboundedfrom the pavements of the road, up to Napoleon himself. As at Brienne, hehad over his head the shriek of the bullets and of the heavy artillery.Mouldy cannon-balls, old sword-blades, and shapeless projectiles, eaten upwith rust, were picked up at the spot where his horse&rsquo;s feet stood. <i>Scabrarubigine</i>. A few years ago, a shell of sixty pounds, still charged, andwith its fuse broken off level with the bomb, was unearthed. It was atthis last post that the Emperor said to his guide, Lacoste, a hostile andterrified peasant, who was attached to the saddle of a hussar, and whoturned round at every discharge of canister and tried to hide behindNapoleon: &ldquo;Fool, it is shameful! You&rsquo;ll get yourself killed with a ball inthe back.&rdquo; He who writes these lines has himself found, in the friablesoil of this knoll, on turning over the sand, the remains of the neck of abomb, disintegrated, by the oxidization of six and forty years, and oldfragments of iron which parted like elder-twigs between the fingers.</p><p>Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains,where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place, are nolonger what they were on June 18, 1815. By taking from this mournful fieldthe wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real relief has been takenaway, and history, disconcerted, no longer finds her bearings there. Ithas been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it. Wellington, when hebeheld Waterloo once more, two years later, exclaimed, &ldquo;They have alteredmy field of battle!&rdquo; Where the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by thelion, rises to-day, there was a hillock which descended in an easy slopetowards the Nivelles road, but which was almost an escarpment on the sideof the highway to Genappe. The elevation of this escarpment can still bemeasured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres whichenclose the road from Genappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is onthe left; the other, the German tomb, is on the right. There is no Frenchtomb. The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France. Thanks to thethousands upon thousands of cartloads of earth employed in the hillock onehundred and fifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference, theplateau of Mont-Saint-Jean is now accessible by an easy slope. On the dayof battle, particularly on the side of La Haie-Sainte, it was abrupt anddifficult of approach. The slope there is so steep that the English cannoncould not see the farm, situated in the bottom of the valley, which wasthe centre of the combat. On the 18th of June, 1815, the rains had stillfarther increased this acclivity, the mud complicated the problem of theascent, and the men not only slipped back, but stuck fast in the mire.Along the crest of the plateau ran a sort of trench whose presence it wasimpossible for the distant observer to divine.</p><p>What was this trench? Let us explain. Braine-l&rsquo;Alleud is a Belgianvillage; Ohain is another. These villages, both of them concealed incurves of the landscape, are connected by a road about a league and a halfin length, which traverses the plain along its undulating level, and oftenenters and buries itself in the hills like a furrow, which makes a ravineof this road in some places. In 1815, as at the present day, this road cutthe crest of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean between the two highways fromGenappe and Nivelles; only, it is now on a level with the plain; it wasthen a hollow way. Its two slopes have been appropriated for themonumental hillock. This road was, and still is, a trench throughout thegreater portion of its course; a hollow trench, sometimes a dozen feet indepth, and whose banks, being too steep, crumbled away here and there,particularly in winter, under driving rains.

Napoleon was accustomed to gaze steadily at war; henever added up the heart-rending details, cipher by cipher; ciphersmattered little to him, provided that they furnished the total&mdash;victory;he was not alarmed if the beginnings did go astray, since he thoughthimself the master and the possessor at the end; he knew how to wait,supposing himself to be out of the question, and he treated destiny as hisequal: he seemed to say to fate, Thou wilt not dare.</p><p>Composed half of light and half of shadow, Napoleon thought himselfprotected in good and tolerated in evil. He had, or thought that he had, aconnivance, one might almost say a complicity, of events in his favor,which was equivalent to the invulnerability of antiquity.</p><p>Nevertheless, when one has Bérésina, Leipzig, and Fontainebleau behindone, it seems as though one might distrust Waterloo. A mysterious frownbecomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens.</p><p>At the moment when Wellington retreated, Napoleon shuddered.

The man of Marengo was wiping outAgincourt.</p><p>So the Emperor, meditating on this terrible turn of fortune, swept hisglass for the last time over all the points of the field of battle. Hisguard, standing behind him with grounded arms, watched him from below witha sort of religion. He pondered; he examined the slopes, noted thedeclivities, scrutinized the clumps of trees, the square of rye, the path;he seemed to be counting each bush. He gazed with some intentness at theEnglish barricades of the two highways,&mdash;two large abatis of trees,that on the road to Genappe above La Haie-Sainte, armed with two cannon,the only ones out of all the English artillery which commanded theextremity of the field of battle, and that on the road to Nivelles wheregleamed the Dutch bayonets of Chassé&rsquo;s brigade. Near this barricade heobserved the old chapel of Saint Nicholas, painted white, which stands atthe angle of the crossroad near Braine-l&rsquo;Alleud; he bent down and spokein a low voice to the guide Lacoste.

They formed a front aquarter of a league in extent. They were giant men, on colossal horses.There were six and twenty squadrons of them; and they had behind them tosupport them Lefebvre-Desnouettes&rsquo;s division,&mdash;the one hundred andsix picked gendarmes, the light cavalry of the Guard, eleven hundred andninety-seven men, and the lancers of the guard of eight hundred and eightylances. They wore casques without horse-tails, and cuirasses of beateniron, with horse-pistols in their holsters, and long sabre-swords. Thatmorning the whole army had admired them, when, at nine o&rsquo;clock, withbraying of trumpets and all the music playing &ldquo;Let us watch o&rsquo;er theSafety of the Empire,&rdquo; they had come in a solid column, with one of theirbatteries on their flank, another in their centre, and deployed in tworanks between the roads to Genappe and Frischemont, and taken up theirposition for battle in that powerful second line, so cleverly arranged byNapoleon, which, having on its extreme left Kellermann&rsquo;s cuirassiers andon its extreme right Milhaud&rsquo;s cuirassiers, had, so to speak, two wings ofiron.</p><p>Aide-de-camp Bernard carried them the Emperor&rsquo;s orders. Ney drew his swordand placed himself at their head. The enormous squadrons were set inmotion.</p><p>Then a formidable spectacle was seen.</p><p>All their cavalry, with upraised swords, standards and trumpets flung tothe breeze, formed in columns by divisions, descended, by a simultaneousmovement and like one man, with the precision of a brazen battering-ramwhich is effecting a breach, the hill of La Belle Alliance, plunged intothe terrible depths in which so many men had already fallen, disappearedthere in the smoke, then emerging from that shadow, reappeared on theother side of the valley, still compact and in close ranks, mounting at afull trot, through a storm of grape-shot which burst upon them, theterrible muddy slope of the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean. They ascended,grave, threatening, imperturbable; in the intervals between the musketryand the artillery, their colossal trampling was audible. Being twodivisions, there were two columns of them; Wathier&rsquo;s division held theright, Delort&rsquo;s division was on the left. It seemed as though two immenseadders of steel were to be seen crawling towards the crest of thetable-land. It traversed the battle like a prodigy.</p><p>Nothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt of theMuskowa by the heavy cavalry; Murat was lacking here, but Ney was againpresent. It seemed as though that mass had become a monster and had butone soul. Each column undulated and swelled like the ring of a polyp. Theycould be seen through a vast cloud of smoke which was rent here and there.A confusion of helmets, of cries, of sabres, a stormy heaving of thecruppers of horses amid the cannons and the flourish of trumpets, aterrible and disciplined tumult; over all, the cuirasses like the scaleson the hydra.</p><p>These narrations seemed to belong to another age. Something parallel tothis vision appeared, no doubt, in the ancient Orphic epics, which told ofthe centaurs, the old hippanthropes, those Titans with human heads andequestrian chests who scaled Olympus at a gallop, horrible, invulnerable,sublime&mdash;gods and beasts.</p><p>Odd numerical coincidence,&mdash;twenty-six battalions rode to meettwenty-six battalions. Behind the crest of the plateau, in the shadow ofthe masked battery, the English infantry, formed into thirteen squares,two battalions to the square, in two lines, with seven in the first line,six in the second, the stocks of their guns to their shoulders, taking aimat that which was on the point of appearing, waited, calm, mute,motionless. They did not see the cuirassiers, and the cuirassiers did notsee them. They listened to the rise of this flood of men. They heard theswelling noise of three thousand horse, the alternate and symmetricaltramp of their hoofs at full trot, the jingling of the cuirasses, theclang of the sabres and a sort of grand and savage breathing. There ensueda most terrible silence; then, all at once, a long file of uplifted arms,brandishing sabres, appeared above the crest, and casques, trumpets, andstandards, and three thousand heads with gray moustaches, shouting, &ldquo;Vivel&rsquo;Empereur!&rdquo; All this cavalry debouched on the plateau, and it was likethe appearance of an earthquake.</p><p>All at once, a tragic incident; on the English left, on our right, thehead of the column of cuirassiers reared up with a frightful clamor. Onarriving at the culminating point of the crest, ungovernable, utterlygiven over to fury and their course of extermination of the squares andcannon, the cuirassiers had just caught sight of a trench,&mdash;a trenchbetween them and the English. It was the hollow road of Ohain.</p><p>It was a terrible moment. The ravine was there, unexpected, yawning,directly under the horses&rsquo; feet, two fathoms deep between its doubleslopes; the second file pushed the first into it, and the third pushed onthe second; the horses reared and fell backward, landed on their haunches,slid down, all four feet in the air, crushing and overwhelming the riders;and there being no means of retreat,&mdash;the whole column being nolonger anything more than a projectile,&mdash;the force which had beenacquired to crush the English crushed the French; the inexorable ravinecould only yield when filled; horses and riders rolled there pell-mell,grinding each other, forming but one mass of flesh in this gulf: when thistrench was full of living men, the rest marched over them and passed on.Almost a third of Dubois&rsquo;s brigade fell into that abyss.</p><p>This began the loss of the battle.</p><p>A local tradition, which evidently exaggerates matters, says that twothousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow road ofOhain. This figure probably comprises all the other corpses which wereflung into this ravine the day after the combat.</p><p>Let us note in passing that it was Dubois&rsquo;s sorely tried brigade which, anhour previously, making a charge to one side, had captured the flag of theLunenburg battalion.</p><p>Napoleon, before giving the order for this charge of Milhaud&rsquo;scuirassiers, had scrutinized the ground, but had not been able to see thathollow road, which did not even form a wrinkle on the surface of theplateau. Warned, nevertheless, and put on the alert by the little whitechapel which marks its angle of junction with the Nivelles highway, he hadprobably put a question as to the possibility of an obstacle, to the guideLacoste. The guide had answered No. We might almost affirm that Napoleon&rsquo;scatastrophe originated in that sign of a peasant&rsquo;s head.</p><p>Other fatalities were destined to arise.</p><p>Was it possible that Napoleon should have won that battle? We answer No.Why? Because of Wellington? Because of Blücher? No. Because of God.</p><p>Bonaparte victor at Waterloo; that does not come within the law of thenineteenth century. Another series of facts was in preparation, in whichthere was no longer any room for Napoleon. The ill will of events haddeclared itself long before.</p><p>It was time that this vast man should fall.</p><p>The excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed the balance.This individual alone counted for more than a universal group. Theseplethoras of all human vitality concentrated in a single head; the worldmounting to the brain of one man,&mdash;this would be mortal tocivilization were it to last. The moment had arrived for the incorruptibleand supreme equity to alter its plan. Probably the principles and theelements, on which the regular gravitations of the moral, as of thematerial, world depend, had complained. Smoking blood, over-filledcemeteries, mothers in tears,&mdash;these are formidable pleaders. Whenthe earth is suffering from too heavy a burden, there are mysteriousgroanings of the shades, to which the abyss lends an ear.</p><p>Napoleon had been denounced in the infinite and his fall had been decidedon.</p><p>He embarrassed God.</p><p>Waterloo is not a battle; it is a change of front on the part of theUniverse.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0080" id="link2HCH0080"></a>CHAPTER X&mdash;THE PLATEAU OF MONT-SAINT-JEAN</h3><p>The battery was unmasked at the same moment with the ravine.</p><p>Sixty cannons and the thirteen squares darted lightning point-blank on thecuirassiers. The intrepid General Delort made the military salute to theEnglish battery.</p><p>The whole of the flying artillery of the English had re-entered thesquares at a gallop. The cuirassiers had not had even the time for a halt.The disaster of the hollow road had decimated, but not discouraged them.They belonged to that class of men who, when diminished in number,increase in courage.</p><p>Wathier&rsquo;s column alone had suffered in the disaster; Delort&rsquo;s column,which Ney had deflected to the left, as though he had a presentiment of anambush, had arrived whole.</p><p>The cuirassiers hurled themselves on the English squares.</p><p>At full speed, with bridles loose, swords in their teeth, pistols in fist,&mdash;suchwas the attack.</p><p>There are moments in battles in which the soul hardens the man until thesoldier is changed into a statue, and when all this flesh turns intogranite. The English battalions, desperately assaulted, did not stir.</p><p>Then it was terrible.</p><p>All the faces of the English squares were attacked at once. A frenziedwhirl enveloped them. That cold infantry remained impassive. The firstrank knelt and received the cuirassiers on their bayonets, the secondranks shot them down; behind the second rank the cannoneers charged theirguns, the front of the square parted, permitted the passage of an eruptionof grape-shot, and closed again. The cuirassiers replied by crushing them.Their great horses reared, strode across the ranks, leaped over thebayonets and fell, gigantic, in the midst of these four living wells. Thecannon-balls ploughed furrows in these cuirassiers; the cuirassiers madebreaches in the squares. Files of men disappeared, ground to dust underthe horses. The bayonets plunged into the bellies of these centaurs; hencea hideousness of wounds which has probably never been seen anywhere else.The squares, wasted by this mad cavalry, closed up their ranks withoutflinching. Inexhaustible in the matter of grape-shot, they createdexplosions in their assailants&rsquo; midst. The form of this combat wasmonstrous. These squares were no longer battalions, they were craters;those cuirassiers were no longer cavalry, they were a tempest. Each squarewas a volcano attacked by a cloud; lava contended with lightning.</p><p>The square on the extreme right, the most exposed of all, being in theair, was almost annihilated at the very first shock. lt was formed of the75th regiment of Highlanders. The bagpipe-player in the centre dropped hismelancholy eyes, filled with the reflections of the forests and the lakes,in profound inattention, while men were being exterminated around him, andseated on a drum, with his pibroch under his arm, played the Highlandairs. These Scotchmen died thinking of Ben Lothian, as did the Greeksrecalling Argos. The sword of a cuirassier, which hewed down the bagpipesand the arm which bore it, put an end to the song by killing the singer.</p><p>The cuirassiers, relatively few in number, and still further diminished bythe catastrophe of the ravine, had almost the whole English army againstthem, but they multiplied themselves so that each man of them was equal toten. Nevertheless, some Hanoverian battalions yielded. Wellingtonperceived it, and thought of his cavalry. Had Napoleon at that same momentthought of his infantry, he would have won the battle. This forgetfulnesswas his great and fatal mistake.</p><p>All at once, the cuirassiers, who had been the assailants, foundthemselves assailed. The English cavalry was at their back. Before themtwo squares, behind them Somerset; Somerset meant fourteen hundreddragoons of the guard. On the right, Somerset had Dornberg with the Germanlight-horse, and on his left, Trip with the Belgian carabineers; thecuirassiers attacked on the flank and in front, before and in the rear, byinfantry and cavalry, had to face all sides. What mattered it to them?They were a whirlwind. Their valor was something indescribable.</p><p>In addition to this, they had behind them the battery, which was stillthundering. It was necessary that it should be so, or they could neverhave been wounded in the back. One of their cuirasses, pierced on theshoulder by a ball from a biscayan,<a href="#linknote-9" name="linknoteref-9" id="linknoteref-9">9</a> is in the collection of theWaterloo Museum.</p><p>For such Frenchmen nothing less than such Englishmen was needed. It was nolonger a hand-to-hand conflict; it was a shadow, a fury, a dizzy transportof souls and courage, a hurricane of lightning swords. In an instant thefourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only eight hundred. Fuller, theirlieutenant-colonel, fell dead. Ney rushed up with the lancers andLefebvre-Desnouettes&rsquo;s light-horse. The plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean wascaptured, recaptured, captured again. The cuirassiers quitted the cavalryto return to the infantry; or, to put it more exactly, the whole of thatformidable rout collared each other without releasing the other. Thesquares still held firm.</p><p>There were a dozen assaults. Ney had four horses killed under him. Halfthe cuirassiers remained on the plateau. This conflict lasted two hours.</p><p>The English army was profoundly shaken. There is no doubt that, had theynot been enfeebled in their first shock by the disaster of the hollow roadthe cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the centre and decided the victory.This extraordinary cavalry petrified Clinton, who had seen Talavera andBadajoz. Wellington, three-quarters vanquished, admired heroically. Hesaid in an undertone, &ldquo;Sublime!&rdquo;</p><p>The cuirassiers annihilated seven squares out of thirteen, took or spikedsixty pieces of ordnance, and captured from the English regiments sixflags, which three cuirassiers and three chasseurs of the Guard bore tothe Emperor, in front of the farm of La Belle Alliance.</p><p>Wellington&rsquo;s situation had grown worse. This strange battle was like aduel between two raging, wounded men, each of whom, still fighting andstill resisting, is expending all his blood.</p><p>Which of the two will be the first to fall?</p><p>The conflict on the plateau continued.</p><p>What had become of the cuirassiers? No one could have told. One thing iscertain, that on the day after the battle, a cuirassier and his horse werefound dead among the woodwork of the scales for vehicles atMont-Saint-Jean, at the very point where the four roads from Nivelles,Genappe, La Hulpe, and Brussels meet and intersect each other. Thishorseman had pierced the English lines. One of the men who picked up thebody still lives at Mont-Saint-Jean. His name is Dehaze. He was eighteenyears old at that time.</p><p>Wellington felt that he was yielding. The crisis was at hand.</p><p>The cuirassiers had not succeeded, since the centre was not brokenthrough. As every one was in possession of the plateau, no one held it,and in fact it remained, to a great extent, with the English. Wellingtonheld the village and the culminating plain; Ney had only the crest and theslope. They seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides.</p><p>But the weakening of the English seemed irremediable. The bleeding of thatarmy was horrible. Kempt, on the left wing, demanded reinforcements.&ldquo;There are none,&rdquo; replied Wellington; &ldquo;he must let himself be killed!&rdquo; Almost at that same moment, a singular coincidence which paints theexhaustion of the two armies, Ney demanded infantry from Napoleon, andNapoleon exclaimed, &ldquo;Infantry! Where does he expect me to get it? Does hethink I can make it?&rdquo;</p><p>Nevertheless, the English army was in the worse case of the two. Thefurious onsets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron and breastsof steel had ground the infantry to nothing. A few men clustered round aflag marked the post of a regiment; such and such a battalion wascommanded only by a captain or a lieutenant; Alten&rsquo;s division, already soroughly handled at La Haie-Sainte, was almost destroyed; the intrepidBelgians of Van Kluze&rsquo;s brigade strewed the rye-fields all along theNivelles road; hardly anything was left of those Dutch grenadiers, who,intermingled with Spaniards in our ranks in 1811, fought againstWellington; and who, in 1815, rallied to the English standard, foughtagainst Napoleon. The loss in officers was considerable. Lord Uxbridge,who had his leg buried on the following day, had his knee shattered. If,on the French side, in that tussle of the cuirassiers, Delort, l&rsquo;Héritier,Colbert, Dnop, Travers, and Blancard were disabled, on the side of theEnglish there was Alten wounded, Barne wounded, Delancey killed, VanMeeren killed, Ompteda killed, the whole of Wellington&rsquo;s staff decimated,and England had the worse of it in that bloody scale. The second regimentof foot-guards had lost five lieutenant-colonels, four captains, and threeensigns; the first battalion of the 30th infantry had lost 24 officers and1,200 soldiers; the 79th Highlanders had lost 24 officers wounded, 18officers killed, 450 soldiers killed. The Hanoverian hussars ofCumberland, a whole regiment, with Colonel Hacke at its head, who wasdestined to be tried later on and cashiered, had turned bridle in thepresence of the fray, and had fled to the forest of Soignes, sowing defeatall the way to Brussels. The transports, ammunition-wagons, thebaggage-wagons, the wagons filled with wounded, on perceiving that theFrench were gaining ground and approaching the forest, rushed headlongthither. The Dutch, mowed down by the French cavalry, cried, &ldquo;Alarm!&rdquo; FromVert-Coucou to Groenendael, for a distance of nearly two leagues in thedirection of Brussels, according to the testimony of eye-witnesses who arestill alive, the roads were encumbered with fugitives. This panic was suchthat it attacked the Prince de Condé at Mechlin, and Louis XVIII. atGhent. With the exception of the feeble reserve echelonned behind theambulance established at the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean, and of Vivian&rsquo;s andVandeleur&rsquo;s brigades, which flanked the left wing, Wellington had nocavalry left. A number of batteries lay unhorsed. These facts are attestedby Siborne; and Pringle, exaggerating the disaster, goes so far as to saythat the Anglo-Dutch army was reduced to thirty-four thousand men. TheIron Duke remained calm, but his lips blanched. Vincent, the Austriancommissioner, Alava, the Spanish commissioner, who were present at thebattle in the English staff, thought the Duke lost. At five o&rsquo;clockWellington drew out his watch, and he was heard to murmur these sinisterwords, &ldquo;Blücher, or night!&rdquo;</p><p>It was at about that moment that a distant line of bayonets gleamed on theheights in the direction of Frischemont.</p><p>Here comes the change of face in this giant drama.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0081" id="link2HCH0081"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;A BAD GUIDE TO NAPOLEON; A GOOD GUIDE TO BÜLOW</h3><p>The painful surprise of Napoleon is well known.

Death instead of life.</p><p>Fate has these turns; the throne of the world was expected; it was SaintHelena that was seen.</p><p>If the little shepherd who served as guide to Bülow, Blücher&rsquo;s lieutenant,had advised him to debouch from the forest above Frischemont, instead ofbelow Plancenoit, the form of the nineteenth century might, perhaps, havebeen different. Napoleon would have won the battle of Waterloo. By anyother route than that below Plancenoit, the Prussian army would have comeout upon a ravine impassable for artillery, and Bülow would not havearrived.</p><p>Now the Prussian general, Muffling, declares that one hour&rsquo;s delay, andBlücher would not have found Wellington on his feet. &ldquo;The battle waslost.&rdquo;</p><p>It was time that Bülow should arrive, as will be seen. He had, moreover,been very much delayed. He had bivouacked at Dion-le-Mont, and had set outat daybreak; but the roads were impassable, and his divisions stuck fastin the mire. The ruts were up to the hubs of the cannons. Moreover, he hadbeen obliged to pass the Dyle on the narrow bridge of Wavre; the streetleading to the bridge had been fired by the French, so the caissons andammunition-wagons could not pass between two rows of burning houses, andhad been obliged to wait until the conflagration was extinguished. It wasmidday before Bülow&rsquo;s vanguard had been able to reachChapelle-Saint-Lambert.</p><p>Had the action been begun two hours earlier, it would have been over atfour o&rsquo;clock, and Blücher would have fallen on the battle won by Napoleon.Such are these immense risks proportioned to an infinite which we cannotcomprehend.</p><p>The Emperor had been the first, as early as midday, to descry with hisfield-glass, on the extreme horizon, something which had attracted hisattention. He had said, &ldquo;I see yonder a cloud, which seems to me to betroops.&rdquo; Then he asked the Duc de Dalmatie, &ldquo;Soult, what do you see in thedirection of Chapelle-Saint-Lambert?&rdquo; The marshal, levelling his glass,answered, &ldquo;Four or five thousand men, Sire; evidently Grouchy.&rdquo; But itremained motionless in the mist. All the glasses of the staff had studied&ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; pointed out by the Emperor. Some said: &ldquo;It is trees.&rdquo; Thetruth is, that the cloud did not move. The Emperor detached Domon&rsquo;sdivision of light cavalry to reconnoitre in that quarter.</p><p>Bülow had not moved, in fact. His vanguard was very feeble, and couldaccomplish nothing. He was obliged to wait for the body of the army corps,and he had received orders to concentrate his forces before entering intoline; but at five o&rsquo;clock, perceiving Wellington&rsquo;s peril, Blücher orderedBülow to attack, and uttered these remarkable words: &ldquo;We must give air tothe English army.&rdquo;</p><p>A little later, the divisions of Losthin, Hiller, Hacke, and Rysseldeployed before Lobau&rsquo;s corps, the cavalry of Prince William of Prussiadebouched from the forest of Paris, Plancenoit was in flames, and thePrussian cannon-balls began to rain even upon the ranks of the guard inreserve behind Napoleon.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0082" id="link2HCH0082"></a>CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE GUARD</h3><p>Every one knows the rest,&mdash;the irruption of a third army; the battlebroken to pieces; eighty-six mouths of fire thundering simultaneously;Pirch the first coming up with Bülow; Zieten&rsquo;s cavalry led by Blücher inperson, the French driven back; Marcognet swept from the plateau of Ohain;Durutte dislodged from Papelotte; Donzelot and Quiot retreating; Lobaucaught on the flank; a fresh battle precipitating itself on our dismantledregiments at nightfall; the whole English line resuming the offensive andthrust forward; the gigantic breach made in the French army; the Englishgrape-shot and the Prussian grape-shot aiding each other; theextermination; disaster in front; disaster on the flank; the Guardentering the line in the midst of this terrible crumbling of all things.</p><p>Conscious that they were about to die, they shouted, &ldquo;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&rdquo; History records nothing more touching than that agony bursting forth inacclamations.</p><p>The sky had been overcast all day long. All of a sudden, at that verymoment,&mdash;it was eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening&mdash;the clouds on thehorizon parted, and allowed the grand and sinister glow of the setting sunto pass through, athwart the elms on the Nivelles road. They had seen itrise at Austerlitz.</p><p>Each battalion of the Guard was commanded by a general for this finalcatastrophe. Friant, Michel, Roguet, Harlet, Mallet, Poret de Morvan, werethere. When the tall caps of the grenadiers of the Guard, with their largeplaques bearing the eagle appeared, symmetrical, in line, tranquil, in themidst of that combat, the enemy felt a respect for France; they thoughtthey beheld twenty victories entering the field of battle, with wingsoutspread, and those who were the conquerors, believing themselves to bevanquished, retreated; but Wellington shouted, &ldquo;Up, Guards, and aimstraight!&rdquo; The red regiment of English guards, lying flat behind thehedges, sprang up, a cloud of grape-shot riddled the tricolored flag andwhistled round our eagles; all hurled themselves forwards, and the finalcarnage began. In the darkness, the Imperial Guard felt the army losingground around it, and in the vast shock of the rout it heard the desperateflight which had taken the place of the &ldquo;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&rdquo; and, withflight behind it, it continued to advance, more crushed, losing more menat every step that it took. There were none who hesitated, no timid men inits ranks. The soldier in that troop was as much of a hero as the general.Not a man was missing in that suicide.</p><p>Ney, bewildered, great with all the grandeur of accepted death, offeredhimself to all blows in that tempest. He had his fifth horse killed underhim there. Perspiring, his eyes aflame, foaming at the mouth, with uniformunbuttoned, one of his epaulets half cut off by a sword-stroke from ahorseguard, his plaque with the great eagle dented by a bullet; bleeding,bemired, magnificent, a broken sword in his hand, he said, &ldquo;Come and seehow a Marshal of France dies on the field of battle!&rdquo; But in vain; he didnot die. He was haggard and angry. At Drouet d&rsquo;Erlon he hurled thisquestion, &ldquo;Are you not going to get yourself killed?&rdquo; In the midst of allthat artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men, he shouted: &ldquo;So thereis nothing for me!

The cry &ldquo;Treachery!&rdquo; was followed by acry of &ldquo;Save yourselves who can!&rdquo; An army which is disbanding is like athaw. All yields, splits, cracks, floats, rolls, falls, jostles, hastens,is precipitated. The disintegration is unprecedented. Ney borrows a horse,leaps upon it, and without hat, cravat, or sword, places himself acrossthe Brussels road, stopping both English and French. He strives to detainthe army, he recalls it to its duty, he insults it, he clings to the rout.He is overwhelmed. The soldiers fly from him, shouting, &ldquo;Long live MarshalNey!&rdquo; Two of Durutte&rsquo;s regiments go and come in affright as though tossedback and forth between the swords of the Uhlans and the fusillade of thebrigades of Kempt, Best, Pack, and Rylandt; the worst of hand-to-handconflicts is the defeat; friends kill each other in order to escape;squadrons and battalions break and disperse against each other, like thetremendous foam of battle. Lobau at one extremity, and Reille at theother, are drawn into the tide. In vain does Napoleon erect walls fromwhat is left to him of his Guard; in vain does he expend in a last efforthis last serviceable squadrons. Quiot retreats before Vivian, Kellermannbefore Vandeleur, Lobau before Bülow, Morand before Pirch, Domon andSubervic before Prince William of Prussia; Guyot, who led the Emperor&rsquo;ssquadrons to the charge, falls beneath the feet of the English dragoons.Napoleon gallops past the line of fugitives, harangues, urges, threatens,entreats them. All the mouths which in the morning had shouted, &ldquo;Long livethe Emperor!&rdquo; remain gaping; they hardly recognize him. The Prussiancavalry, newly arrived, dashes forwards, flies, hews, slashes, kills,exterminates. Horses lash out, the cannons flee; the soldiers of theartillery-train unharness the caissons and use the horses to make theirescape; transports overturned, with all four wheels in the air, clog theroad and occasion massacres. Men are crushed, trampled down, others walkover the dead and the living. Arms are lost. A dizzy multitude fills theroads, the paths, the bridges, the plains, the hills, the valleys, thewoods, encumbered by this invasion of forty thousand men. Shouts despair,knapsacks and guns flung among the rye, passages forced at the point ofthe sword, no more comrades, no more officers, no more generals, aninexpressible terror. Zieten putting France to the sword at its leisure.Lions converted into goats. Such was the flight.</p><p>At Genappe, an effort was made to wheel about, to present a battle front,to draw up in line. Lobau rallied three hundred men. The entrance to thevillage was barricaded, but at the first volley of Prussian canister, alltook to flight again, and Lobau was taken. That volley of grape-shot canbe seen to-day imprinted on the ancient gable of a brick building on theright of the road at a few minutes&rsquo; distance before you enter Genappe. ThePrussians threw themselves into Genappe, furious, no doubt, that they werenot more entirely the conquerors. The pursuit was stupendous. Blücherordered extermination. Roguet had set the lugubrious example ofthreatening with death any French grenadier who should bring him aPrussian prisoner. Blücher outdid Roguet. Duhesme, the general of theYoung Guard, hemmed in at the doorway of an inn at Genappe, surrenderedhis sword to a huzzar of death, who took the sword and slew the prisoner.The victory was completed by the assassination of the vanquished. Let usinflict punishment, since we are history: old Blücher disgraced himself.This ferocity put the finishing touch to the disaster. The desperate routetraversed Genappe, traversed Quatre-Bras, traversed Gosselies, traversedFrasnes, traversed Charleroi, traversed Thuin, and only halted at thefrontier. Alas! and who, then, was fleeing in that manner? The Grand Army.</p><p>This vertigo, this terror, this downfall into ruin of the loftiest braverywhich ever astounded history,&mdash;is that causeless? No. The shadow ofan enormous right is projected athwart Waterloo. It is the day of destiny.The force which is mightier than man produced that day. Hence theterrified wrinkle of those brows; hence all those great souls surrenderingtheir swords. Those who had conquered Europe have fallen prone on theearth, with nothing left to say nor to do, feeling the present shadow of aterrible presence. <i>Hoc erat in fatis</i>. That day the perspective ofthe human race underwent a change. Waterloo is the hinge of the nineteenthcentury. The disappearance of the great man was necessary to the advent ofthe great century. Some one, a person to whom one replies not, took theresponsibility on himself. The panic of heroes can be explained. In thebattle of Waterloo there is something more than a cloud, there issomething of the meteor. God has passed by.</p><p>At nightfall, in a meadow near Genappe, Bernard and Bertrand seized by theskirt of his coat and detained a man, haggard, pensive, sinister, gloomy,who, dragged to that point by the current of the rout, had justdismounted, had passed the bridle of his horse over his arm, and with wildeye was returning alone to Waterloo. It was Napoleon, the immensesomnambulist of this dream which had crumbled, essaying once more toadvance.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0084" id="link2HCH0084"></a>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;THE LAST SQUARE</h3><p>Several squares of the Guard, motionless amid this stream of the defeat,as rocks in running water, held their own until night. Night came, deathalso; they awaited that double shadow, and, invincible, allowed themselvesto be enveloped therein. Each regiment, isolated from the rest, and havingno bond with the army, now shattered in every part, died alone. They hadtaken up position for this final action, some on the heights of Rossomme,others on the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean. There, abandoned, vanquished,terrible, those gloomy squares endured their death-throes in formidablefashion. Ulm, Wagram, Jena, Friedland, died with them.</p><p>At twilight, towards nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening, one of them was left atthe foot of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. In that fatal valley, at thefoot of that declivity which the cuirassiers had ascended, now inundatedby the masses of the English, under the converging fires of the victorioushostile cavalry, under a frightful density of projectiles, this squarefought on. It was commanded by an obscure officer named Cambronne. At eachdischarge, the square diminished and replied. It replied to the grape-shotwith a fusillade, continually contracting its four walls. The fugitivespausing breathless for a moment in the distance, listened in the darknessto that gloomy and ever-decreasing thunder.</p><p>When this legion had been reduced to a handful, when nothing was left oftheir flag but a rag, when their guns, the bullets all gone, were nolonger anything but clubs, when the heap of corpses was larger than thegroup of survivors, there reigned among the conquerors, around those mendying so sublimely, a sort of sacred terror, and the English artillery,taking breath, became silent. This furnished a sort of respite. Thesecombatants had around them something in the nature of a swarm of spectres,silhouettes of men on horseback, the black profiles of cannon, the whitesky viewed through wheels and gun-carriages, the colossal death&rsquo;s-head,which the heroes saw constantly through the smoke, in the depths of thebattle, advanced upon them and gazed at them. Through the shades oftwilight they could hear the pieces being loaded; the matches all lighted,like the eyes of tigers at night, formed a circle round their heads; allthe lintstocks of the English batteries approached the cannons, and then,with emotion, holding the supreme moment suspended above these men, anEnglish general, Colville according to some, Maitland according to others,shouted to them, &ldquo;Surrender, brave Frenchmen!&rdquo; Cambronne replied, &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p><p>{EDITOR&rsquo;S COMMENTARY: Another edition of this book has the word &ldquo;Merde!&rdquo; in lieu of the &mdash;&mdash; above.}</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0085" id="link2HCH0085"></a>CHAPTER XV&mdash;CAMBRONNE</h3><p>If any French reader object to having his susceptibilities offended, onewould have to refrain from repeating in his presence what is perhaps thefinest reply that a Frenchman ever made.

It reaches thegrandeur of Æschylus!</p><p>Cambronne&rsquo;s reply produces the effect of a violent break. &rsquo;Tis like thebreaking of a heart under a weight of scorn. &rsquo;Tis the overflow of agonybursting forth. Who conquered? Wellington? No! Had it not been forBlücher, he was lost. Was it Blücher? No! If Wellington had not begun,Blücher could not have finished. This Cambronne, this man spending hislast hour, this unknown soldier, this infinitesimal of war, realizes thathere is a falsehood, a falsehood in a catastrophe, and so doublyagonizing; and at the moment when his rage is bursting forth because ofit, he is offered this mockery,&mdash;life! How could he restrain himself?Yonder are all the kings of Europe, the general&rsquo;s flushed with victory,the Jupiter&rsquo;s darting thunderbolts; they have a hundred thousandvictorious soldiers, and back of the hundred thousand a million; theircannon stand with yawning mouths, the match is lighted; they grind downunder their heels the Imperial guards, and the grand army; they have justcrushed Napoleon, and only Cambronne remains,&mdash;only this earthworm isleft to protest. He will protest. Then he seeks for the appropriate wordas one seeks for a sword. His mouth froths, and the froth is the word. Inface of this mean and mighty victory, in face of this victory which countsnone victorious, this desperate soldier stands erect. He grants itsoverwhelming immensity, but he establishes its triviality; and he doesmore than spit upon it. Borne down by numbers, by superior force, by brutematter, he finds in his soul an expression: <i>&ldquo;Excrément!&rdquo;</i> We repeatit,&mdash;to use that word, to do thus, to invent such an expression, isto be the conqueror!</p><p>The spirit of mighty days at that portentous moment made its descent onthat unknown man. Cambronne invents the word for Waterloo as Rougetinvents the &ldquo;Marseillaise,&rdquo; under the visitation of a breath from on high.An emanation from the divine whirlwind leaps forth and comes sweeping overthese men, and they shake, and one of them sings the song supreme, and theother utters the frightful cry.</p><p>This challenge of titanic scorn Cambronne hurls not only at Europe in thename of the Empire,&mdash;that would be a trifle: he hurls it at the pastin the name of the Revolution. It is heard, and Cambronne is recognized aspossessed by the ancient spirit of the Titans. Danton seems to bespeaking! Kléber seems to be bellowing!</p><p>At that word from Cambronne, the English voice responded, &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; Thebatteries flamed, the hill trembled, from all those brazen mouths belcheda last terrible gush of grape-shot; a vast volume of smoke, vaguely whitein the light of the rising moon, rolled out, and when the smoke dispersed,there was no longer anything there. That formidable remnant had beenannihilated; the Guard was dead. The four walls of the living redoubt layprone, and hardly was there discernible, here and there, even a quiver inthe bodies; it was thus that the French legions, greater than the Romanlegions, expired on Mont-Saint-Jean, on the soil watered with rain andblood, amid the gloomy grain, on the spot where nowadays Joseph, whodrives the post-wagon from Nivelles, passes whistling, and cheerfullywhipping up his horse at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0086" id="link2HCH0086"></a>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;QUOT LIBRAS IN DUCE?</h3><p>The battle of Waterloo is an enigma.

Look at thereports. The bulletins are confused, the commentaries involved. Somestammer, others lisp. Jomini divides the battle of Waterloo into fourmoments; Muffling cuts it up into three changes; Charras alone, though wehold another judgment than his on some points, seized with his haughtyglance the characteristic outlines of that catastrophe of human genius inconflict with divine chance. All the other historians suffer from beingsomewhat dazzled, and in this dazzled state they fumble about. It was aday of lightning brilliancy; in fact, a crumbling of the military monarchywhich, to the vast stupefaction of kings, drew all the kingdoms after it&mdash;thefall of force, the defeat of war.</p><p>In this event, stamped with superhuman necessity, the part played by menamounts to nothing.</p><p>If we take Waterloo from Wellington and Blücher, do we thereby depriveEngland and Germany of anything? No. Neither that illustrious England northat august Germany enter into the problem of Waterloo. Thank Heaven,nations are great, independently of the lugubrious feats of the sword.Neither England, nor Germany, nor France is contained in a scabbard. Atthis epoch when Waterloo is only a clashing of swords, above Blücher,Germany has Schiller; above Wellington, England has Byron. A vast dawn ofideas is the peculiarity of our century, and in that aurora England andGermany have a magnificent radiance. They are majestic because they think.The elevation of level which they contribute to civilization is intrinsicwith them; it proceeds from themselves and not from an accident. Theaggrandizement which they have brought to the nineteenth century has notWaterloo as its source. It is only barbarous peoples who undergo rapidgrowth after a victory. That is the temporary vanity of torrents swelledby a storm. Civilized people, especially in our day, are neither elevatednor abased by the good or bad fortune of a captain. Their specific gravityin the human species results from something more than a combat. Theirhonor, thank God! their dignity, their intelligence, their genius, are notnumbers which those gamblers, heroes and conquerors, can put in thelottery of battles. Often a battle is lost and progress is conquered.There is less glory and more liberty. The drum holds its peace; reasontakes the word. It is a game in which he who loses wins. Let us,therefore, speak of Waterloo coldly from both sides. Let us render tochance that which is due to chance, and to God that which is due to God.What is Waterloo? A victory? No. The winning number in the lottery.</p><p>The quine <a href="#linknote-11" name="linknoteref-11" id="linknoteref-11">11</a>won by Europe, paid by France.</p><p>It was not worthwhile to place a lion there.</p><p>Waterloo, moreover, is the strangest encounter in history. Napoleon andWellington. They are not enemies; they are opposites. Never did God, whois fond of antitheses, make a more striking contrast, a more extraordinarycomparison. On one side, precision, foresight, geometry, prudence, anassured retreat, reserves spared, with an obstinate coolness, animperturbable method, strategy, which takes advantage of the ground,tactics, which preserve the equilibrium of battalions, carnage, executedaccording to rule, war regulated, watch in hand, nothing voluntarily leftto chance, the ancient classic courage, absolute regularity; on the other,intuition, divination, military oddity, superhuman instinct, a flamingglance, an indescribable something which gazes like an eagle, and whichstrikes like the lightning, a prodigious art in disdainful impetuosity,all the mysteries of a profound soul, associated with destiny; the stream,the plain, the forest, the hill, summoned, and in a manner, forced toobey, the despot going even so far as to tyrannize over the field ofbattle; faith in a star mingled with strategic science, elevating butperturbing it. Wellington was the Barême of war; Napoleon was its MichaelAngelo; and on this occasion, genius was vanquished by calculation. Onboth sides some one was awaited. It was the exact calculator whosucceeded. Napoleon was waiting for Grouchy; he did not come. Wellingtonexpected Blücher; he came.</p><p>Wellington is classic war taking its revenge. Bonaparte, at his dawning,had encountered him in Italy, and beaten him superbly. The old owl hadfled before the young vulture. The old tactics had been not only struck asby lightning, but disgraced. Who was that Corsican of six and twenty? Whatsignified that splendid ignoramus, who, with everything against him,nothing in his favor, without provisions, without ammunition, withoutcannon, without shoes, almost without an army, with a mere handful of menagainst masses, hurled himself on Europe combined, and absurdly wonvictories in the impossible? Whence had issued that fulminating convict,who almost without taking breath, and with the same set of combatants inhand, pulverized, one after the other, the five armies of the emperor ofGermany, upsetting Beaulieu on Alvinzi, Wurmser on Beaulieu, Mélas onWurmser, Mack on Mélas? Who was this novice in war with the effrontery ofa luminary? The academical military school excommunicated him, and as itlost its footing; hence, the implacable rancor of the old Cæsarism againstthe new; of the regular sword against the flaming sword; and of theexchequer against genius. On the 18th of June, 1815, that rancor had thelast word, and beneath Lodi, Montebello, Montenotte, Mantua, Arcola, itwrote: Waterloo. A triumph of the mediocres which is sweet to themajority. Destiny consented to this irony. In his decline, Napoleon foundWurmser, the younger, again in front of him.</p><p>In fact, to get Wurmser, it sufficed to blanch the hair of Wellington.</p><p>Waterloo is a battle of the first order, won by a captain of the second.</p><p>That which must be admired in the battle of Waterloo, is England; theEnglish firmness, the English resolution, the English blood; the superbthing about England there, no offence to her, was herself. It was not hercaptain; it was her army.</p><p>Wellington, oddly ungrateful, declares in a letter to Lord Bathurst, thathis army, the army which fought on the 18th of June, 1815, was a&ldquo;detestable army.&rdquo; What does that sombre intermingling of bones buriedbeneath the furrows of Waterloo think of that?</p><p>England has been too modest in the matter of Wellington. To makeWellington so great is to belittle England. Wellington is nothing but ahero like many another. Those Scotch Grays, those Horse Guards, thoseregiments of Maitland and of Mitchell, that infantry of Pack and Kempt,that cavalry of Ponsonby and Somerset, those Highlanders playing thepibroch under the shower of grape-shot, those battalions of Rylandt, thoseutterly raw recruits, who hardly knew how to handle a musket holding theirown against Essling&rsquo;s and Rivoli&rsquo;s old troops,&mdash;that is what wasgrand. Wellington was tenacious; in that lay his merit, and we are notseeking to lessen it: but the least of his foot-soldiers and of hiscavalry would have been as solid as he. The iron soldier is worth as muchas the Iron Duke. As for us, all our glorification goes to the Englishsoldier, to the English army, to the English people. If trophy there be,it is to England that the trophy is due. The column of Waterloo would bemore just, if, instead of the figure of a man, it bore on high the statueof a people.</p><p>But this great England will be angry at what we are saying here. She stillcherishes, after her own 1688 and our 1789, the feudal illusion. Shebelieves in heredity and hierarchy. This people, surpassed by none inpower and glory, regards itself as a nation, and not as a people. And as apeople, it willingly subordinates itself and takes a lord for its head. Asa workman, it allows itself to be disdained; as a soldier, it allowsitself to be flogged.</p><p>It will be remembered, that at the battle of Inkermann a sergeant who had,it appears, saved the army, could not be mentioned by Lord Paglan, as theEnglish military hierarchy does not permit any hero below the grade of anofficer to be mentioned in the reports.</p><p>That which we admire above all, in an encounter of the nature of Waterloo,is the marvellous cleverness of chance. A nocturnal rain, the wall ofHougomont, the hollow road of Ohain, Grouchy deaf to the cannon,Napoleon&rsquo;s guide deceiving him, Bülow&rsquo;s guide enlightening him,&mdash;thewhole of this cataclysm is wonderfully conducted.</p><p>On the whole, let us say it plainly, it was more of a massacre than of abattle at Waterloo.</p><p>Of all pitched battles, Waterloo is the one which has the smallest frontfor such a number of combatants. Napoleon three-quarters of a league;Wellington, half a league; seventy-two thousand combatants on each side.From this denseness the carnage arose.</p><p>The following calculation has been made, and the following proportionestablished: Loss of men: at Austerlitz, French, fourteen per cent;Russians, thirty per cent; Austrians, forty-four per cent. At Wagram,French, thirteen per cent; Austrians, fourteen. At the Moskowa, French,thirty-seven per cent; Russians, forty-four. At Bautzen, French, thirteenper cent; Russians and Prussians, fourteen. At Waterloo, French, fifty-sixper cent; the Allies, thirty-one. Total for Waterloo, forty-one per cent;one hundred and forty-four thousand combatants; sixty thousand dead.</p><p>To-day the field of Waterloo has the calm which belongs to the earth, theimpassive support of man, and it resembles all plains.</p><p>At night, moreover, a sort of visionary mist arises from it; and if atraveller strolls there, if he listens, if he watches, if he dreams likeVirgil in the fatal plains of Philippi, the hallucination of thecatastrophe takes possession of him. The frightful 18th of June livesagain; the false monumental hillock disappears, the lion vanishes in air,the battle-field resumes its reality, lines of infantry undulate over theplain, furious gallops traverse the horizon; the frightened dreamerbeholds the flash of sabres, the gleam of bayonets, the flare of bombs,the tremendous interchange of thunders; he hears, as it were, the deathrattle in the depths of a tomb, the vague clamor of the battle phantom;those shadows are grenadiers, those lights are cuirassiers; that skeletonNapoleon, that other skeleton is Wellington; all this no longer exists,and yet it clashes together and combats still; and the ravines areempurpled, and the trees quiver, and there is fury even in the clouds andin the shadows; all those terrible heights, Hougomont, Mont-Saint-Jean,Frischemont, Papelotte, Plancenoit, appear confusedly crowned withwhirlwinds of spectres engaged in exterminating each other.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0087" id="link2HCH0087"></a>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;IS WATERLOO TO BE CONSIDERED GOOD?</h3><p>There exists a very respectable liberal school which does not hateWaterloo. We do not belong to it. To us, Waterloo is but the stupefieddate of liberty. That such an eagle should emerge from such an egg iscertainly unexpected.</p><p>If one places one&rsquo;s self at the culminating point of view of the question,Waterloo is intentionally a counter-revolutionary victory. It is Europeagainst France; it is Petersburg, Berlin, and Vienna against Paris; it isthe <i>statu quo</i> against the initiative; it is the 14th of July, 1789,attacked through the 20th of March, 1815; it is the monarchies clearingthe decks in opposition to the indomitable French rioting. The finalextinction of that vast people which had been in eruption for twenty-sixyears&mdash;such was the dream. The solidarity of the Brunswicks, theNassaus, the Romanoffs, the Hohenzollerns, the Hapsburgs with theBourbons. Waterloo bears divine right on its crupper. It is true, that theEmpire having been despotic, the kingdom by the natural reaction ofthings, was forced to be liberal, and that a constitutional order was theunwilling result of Waterloo, to the great regret of the conquerors. It isbecause revolution cannot be really conquered, and that being providentialand absolutely fatal, it is always cropping up afresh: before Waterloo, inBonaparte overthrowing the old thrones; after Waterloo, in Louis XVIII.granting and conforming to the charter. Bonaparte places a postilion onthe throne of Naples, and a sergeant on the throne of Sweden, employinginequality to demonstrate equality; Louis XVIII. at Saint-Ouencountersigns the declaration of the rights of man. If you wish to gain anidea of what revolution is, call it Progress; and if you wish to acquirean idea of the nature of progress, call it To-morrow. To-morrow fulfilsits work irresistibly, and it is already fulfilling it to-day. It alwaysreaches its goal strangely. It employs Wellington to make of Foy, who wasonly a soldier, an orator. Foy falls at Hougomont and rises again in thetribune. Thus does progress proceed. There is no such thing as a bad toolfor that workman. It does not become disconcerted, but adjusts to itsdivine work the man who has bestridden the Alps, and the good oldtottering invalid of Father Élysée. It makes use of the gouty man as wellas of the conqueror; of the conqueror without, of the gouty man within.Waterloo, by cutting short the demolition of European thrones by thesword, had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to becontinued in another direction. The slashers have finished; it was theturn of the thinkers. The century that Waterloo was intended to arrest haspursued its march. That sinister victory was vanquished by liberty.</p><p>In short, and incontestably, that which triumphed at Waterloo; that whichsmiled in Wellington&rsquo;s rear; that which brought him all the marshals&rsquo;staffs of Europe, including, it is said, the staff of a marshal of France;that which joyously trundled the barrows full of bones to erect the knollof the lion; that which triumphantly inscribed on that pedestal the date &ldquo;<i>June</i>18, 1815&rdquo;; that which encouraged Blücher, as he put the flying army to thesword; that which, from the heights of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean,hovered over France as over its prey, was the counter-revolution. It wasthe counter-revolution which murmured that infamous word &ldquo;dismemberment.&rdquo; On arriving in Paris, it beheld the crater close at hand; it felt thoseashes which scorched its feet, and it changed its mind; it returned to thestammer of a charter.</p><p>Let us behold in Waterloo only that which is in Waterloo. Of intentionalliberty there is none. The counter-revolution was involuntarily liberal,in the same manner as, by a corresponding phenomenon, Napoleon wasinvoluntarily revolutionary. On the 18th of June, 1815, the mountedRobespierre was hurled from his saddle.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0088" id="link2HCH0088"></a>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;A RECRUDESCENCE OF DIVINE RIGHT</h3><p>End of the dictatorship. A whole European system crumbled away.</p><p>The Empire sank into a gloom which resembled that of the Roman world as itexpired. Again we behold the abyss, as in the days of the barbarians; onlythe barbarism of 1815, which must be called by its pet name of thecounter-revolution, was not long breathed, soon fell to panting, andhalted short. The Empire was bewept,&mdash;let us acknowledge the fact,&mdash;andbewept by heroic eyes. If glory lies in the sword converted into asceptre, the Empire had been glory in person. It had diffused over theearth all the light which tyranny can give&mdash;a sombre light. We will saymore; an obscure light. Compared to the true daylight, it is night. Thisdisappearance of night produces the effect of an eclipse.</p><p>Louis XVIII. re-entered Paris. The circling dances of the 8th of Julyeffaced the enthusiasms of the 20th of March. The Corsican became theantithesis of the Bearnese. The flag on the dome of the Tuileries waswhite. The exile reigned. Hartwell&rsquo;s pine table took its place in front ofthe fleur-de-lys-strewn throne of Louis XIV. Bouvines and Fontenoy werementioned as though they had taken place on the preceding day, Austerlitzhaving become antiquated. The altar and the throne fraternizedmajestically. One of the most undisputed forms of the health of society inthe nineteenth century was established over France, and over thecontinent. Europe adopted the white cockade. Trestaillon was celebrated.The device <i>non pluribus impar</i> reappeared on the stone raysrepresenting a sun upon the front of the barracks on the Quai d&rsquo;Orsay.Where there had been an Imperial Guard, there was now a red house. The Arcdu Carrousel, all laden with badly borne victories, thrown out of itselement among these novelties, a little ashamed, it may be, of Marengo andArcola, extricated itself from its predicament with the statue of the Ducd&rsquo;Angoulême. The cemetery of the Madeleine, a terrible pauper&rsquo;s grave in1793, was covered with jasper and marble, since the bones of Louis XVI.and Marie Antoinette lay in that dust.</p><p>In the moat of Vincennes a sepulchral shaft sprang from the earth,recalling the fact that the Duc d&rsquo;Enghien had perished in the very monthwhen Napoleon was crowned. Pope Pius VII., who had performed thecoronation very near this death, tranquilly bestowed his blessing on thefall as he had bestowed it on the elevation. At Schoenbrunn there was alittle shadow, aged four, whom it was seditious to call the King of Rome.And these things took place, and the kings resumed their thrones, and themaster of Europe was put in a cage, and the old regime became the newregime, and all the shadows and all the light of the earth changed place,because, on the afternoon of a certain summer&rsquo;s day, a shepherd said to aPrussian in the forest, &ldquo;Go this way, and not that!&rdquo;</p><p>This 1815 was a sort of lugubrious April. Ancient unhealthy and poisonousrealities were covered with new appearances. A lie wedded 1789; the rightdivine was masked under a charter; fictions became constitutional;prejudices, superstitions and mental reservations, with Article 14 in theheart, were varnished over with liberalism. It was the serpent&rsquo;s change ofskin.</p><p>Man had been rendered both greater and smaller by Napoleon. Under thisreign of splendid matter, the ideal had received the strange name ofideology! It is a grave imprudence in a great man to turn the future intoderision. The populace, however, that food for cannon which is so fond ofthe cannoneer, sought him with its glance. Where is he? What is he doing?&ldquo;Napoleon is dead,&rdquo; said a passer-by to a veteran of Marengo and Waterloo.&ldquo;He dead!&rdquo; cried the soldier; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo; Imagination distrustedthis man, even when overthrown. The depths of Europe were full of darknessafter Waterloo. Something enormous remained long empty through Napoleon&rsquo;sdisappearance.</p><p>The kings placed themselves in this void. Ancient Europe profited by it toundertake reforms. There was a Holy Alliance; <i>Belle-Alliance</i>,Beautiful Alliance, the fatal field of Waterloo had said in advance.</p><p>In presence and in face of that antique Europe reconstructed, the featuresof a new France were sketched out. The future, which the Emperor hadrallied, made its entry. On its brow it bore the star, Liberty. Theglowing eyes of all young generations were turned on it. Singular fact!people were, at one and the same time, in love with the future, Liberty,and the past, Napoleon. Defeat had rendered the vanquished greater.Bonaparte fallen seemed more lofty than Napoleon erect. Those who hadtriumphed were alarmed. England had him guarded by Hudson Lowe, and Francehad him watched by Montchenu. His folded arms became a source ofuneasiness to thrones. Alexander called him &ldquo;my sleeplessness.&rdquo; Thisterror was the result of the quantity of revolution which was contained inhim. That is what explains and excuses Bonapartist liberalism. Thisphantom caused the old world to tremble. The kings reigned, but ill attheir ease, with the rock of Saint Helena on the horizon.</p><p>While Napoleon was passing through the death struggle at Longwood, thesixty thousand men who had fallen on the field of Waterloo were quietlyrotting, and something of their peace was shed abroad over the world. TheCongress of Vienna made the treaties in 1815, and Europe called this theRestoration.</p><p>This is what Waterloo was.</p><p>But what matters it to the Infinite? all that tempest, all that cloud,that war, then that peace? All that darkness did not trouble for a momentthe light of that immense Eye before which a grub skipping from one bladeof grass to another equals the eagle soaring from belfry to belfry on thetowers of Notre Dame.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0089" id="link2HCH0089"></a>CHAPTER XIX&mdash;THE BATTLE-FIELD AT NIGHT</h3><p>Let us return&mdash;it is a necessity in this book&mdash;to that fatalbattle-field.</p><p>On the 18th of June the moon was full. Its light favored Blücher&rsquo;sferocious pursuit, betrayed the traces of the fugitives, delivered up thatdisastrous mass to the eager Prussian cavalry, and aided the massacre.Such tragic favors of the night do occur sometimes during catastrophes.</p><p>After the last cannon-shot had been fired, the plain of Mont-Saint-Jeanremained deserted.</p><p>The English occupied the encampment of the French; it is the usual sign ofvictory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished. They established theirbivouac beyond Rossomme. The Prussians, let loose on the retreating rout,pushed forward. Wellington went to the village of Waterloo to draw up hisreport to Lord Bathurst.</p><p>If ever the <i>sic vos non vobis</i> was applicable, it certainly is tothat village of Waterloo. Waterloo took no part, and lay half a leaguefrom the scene of action. Mont-Saint-Jean was cannonaded, Hougomont wasburned, La Haie-Sainte was taken by assault, Papelotte was burned,Plancenoit was burned, La Belle-Alliance beheld the embrace of the twoconquerors; these names are hardly known, and Waterloo, which worked notin the battle, bears off all the honor.</p><p>We are not of the number of those who flatter war; when the occasionpresents itself, we tell the truth about it. War has frightful beautieswhich we have not concealed; it has also, we acknowledge, some hideousfeatures. One of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of the bodiesof the dead after the victory. The dawn which follows a battle alwaysrises on naked corpses.</p><p>Who does this? Who thus soils the triumph? What hideous, furtive hand isthat which is slipped into the pocket of victory? What pickpockets arethey who ply their trade in the rear of glory? Some philosophers&mdash;Voltaireamong the number&mdash;affirm that it is precisely those persons who have madethe glory. It is the same men, they say; there is no relief corps; thosewho are erect pillage those who are prone on the earth. The hero of theday is the vampire of the night. One has assuredly the right, after all,to strip a corpse a bit when one is the author of that corpse. For our ownpart, we do not think so; it seems to us impossible that the same handshould pluck laurels and purloin the shoes from a dead man.</p><p>One thing is certain, which is, that generally after conquerors followthieves. But let us leave the soldier, especially the contemporarysoldier, out of the question.</p><p>Every army has a rear-guard, and it is that which must be blamed. Bat-likecreatures, half brigands and lackeys; all the sorts of vespertillos thatthat twilight called war engenders; wearers of uniforms, who take no partin the fighting; pretended invalids; formidable limpers; interlopingsutlers, trotting along in little carts, sometimes accompanied by theirwives, and stealing things which they sell again; beggars offeringthemselves as guides to officers; soldiers&rsquo; servants; marauders; armies onthe march in days gone by,&mdash;we are not speaking of the present,&mdash;draggedall this behind them, so that in the special language they are called&ldquo;stragglers.&rdquo; No army, no nation, was responsible for those beings; theyspoke Italian and followed the Germans, then spoke French and followed theEnglish. It was by one of these wretches, a Spanish straggler who spokeFrench, that the Marquis of Fervacques, deceived by his Picard jargon, andtaking him for one of our own men, was traitorously slain and robbed onthe battle-field itself, in the course of the night which followed thevictory of Cerisoles. The rascal sprang from this marauding. Thedetestable maxim, <i>Live on the enemy!</i> produced this leprosy, which astrict discipline alone could heal. There are reputations which aredeceptive; one does not always know why certain generals, great in otherdirections, have been so popular. Turenne was adored by his soldiersbecause he tolerated pillage; evil permitted constitutes part of goodness.Turenne was so good that he allowed the Palatinate to be delivered over tofire and blood. The marauders in the train of an army were more or less innumber, according as the chief was more or less severe. Hoche and Marceauhad no stragglers; Wellington had few, and we do him the justice tomention it.</p><p>Nevertheless, on the night from the 18th to the 19th of June, the deadwere robbed. Wellington was rigid; he gave orders that any one caught inthe act should be shot; but rapine is tenacious. The marauders stole inone corner of the battlefield while others were being shot in another.</p><p>The moon was sinister over this plain.</p><p>Towards midnight, a man was prowling about, or rather, climbing in thedirection of the hollow road of Ohain. To all appearance he was one ofthose whom we have just described,&mdash;neither English nor French,neither peasant nor soldier, less a man than a ghoul attracted by thescent of the dead bodies having theft for his victory, and come to rifleWaterloo. He was clad in a blouse that was something like a great coat; hewas uneasy and audacious; he walked forwards and gazed behind him. Who wasthis man? The night probably knew more of him than the day. He had nosack, but evidently he had large pockets under his coat. From time to timehe halted, scrutinized the plain around him as though to see whether hewere observed, bent over abruptly, disturbed something silent andmotionless on the ground, then rose and fled. His sliding motion, hisattitudes, his mysterious and rapid gestures, caused him to resemble thosetwilight larvæ which haunt ruins, and which ancient Norman legends callthe Alleurs.</p><p>Certain nocturnal wading birds produce these silhouettes among themarshes.</p><p>A glance capable of piercing all that mist deeply would have perceived atsome distance a sort of little sutler&rsquo;s wagon with a fluted wicker hood,harnessed to a famished nag which was cropping the grass across its bit asit halted, hidden, as it were, behind the hovel which adjoins the highwayto Nivelles, at the angle of the road from Mont-Saint-Jean to Brainel&rsquo;Alleud; and in the wagon, a sort of woman seated on coffers andpackages. Perhaps there was some connection between that wagon and thatprowler.</p><p>The darkness was serene. Not a cloud in the zenith. What matters it if theearth be red! the moon remains white; these are the indifferences of thesky. In the fields, branches of trees broken by grape-shot, but notfallen, upheld by their bark, swayed gently in the breeze of night. Abreath, almost a respiration, moved the shrubbery. Quivers which resembledthe departure of souls ran through the grass.</p><p>In the distance the coming and going of patrols and the general rounds ofthe English camp were audible.</p><p>Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte continued to burn, forming, one in the west,the other in the east, two great flames which were joined by the cordon ofbivouac fires of the English, like a necklace of rubies with twocarbuncles at the extremities, as they extended in an immense semicircleover the hills along the horizon.</p><p>We have described the catastrophe of the road of Ohain. The heart isterrified at the thought of what that death must have been to so manybrave men.</p><p>If there is anything terrible, if there exists a reality which surpassesdreams, it is this: to live, to see the sun; to be in full possession ofvirile force; to possess health and joy; to laugh valiantly; to rushtowards a glory which one sees dazzling in front of one; to feel in one&rsquo;sbreast lungs which breathe, a heart which beats, a will which reasons; tospeak, think, hope, love; to have a mother, to have a wife, to havechildren; to have the light&mdash;and all at once, in the space of ashout, in less than a minute, to sink into an abyss; to fall, to roll, tocrush, to be crushed; to see ears of wheat, flowers, leaves, branches; notto be able to catch hold of anything; to feel one&rsquo;s sword useless, menbeneath one, horses on top of one; to struggle in vain, since one&rsquo;s boneshave been broken by some kick in the darkness; to feel a heel which makesone&rsquo;s eyes start from their sockets; to bite horses&rsquo; shoes in one&rsquo;s rage;to stifle, to yell, to writhe; to be beneath, and to say to one&rsquo;s self,&ldquo;But just a little while ago I was a living man!&rdquo;</p><p>There, where that lamentable disaster had uttered its death-rattle, allwas silence now. The edges of the hollow road were encumbered with horsesand riders, inextricably heaped up. Terrible entanglement! There was nolonger any slope, for the corpses had levelled the road with the plain,and reached the brim like a well-filled bushel of barley. A heap of deadbodies in the upper part, a river of blood in the lower part&mdash;suchwas that road on the evening of the 18th of June, 1815. The blood ran evento the Nivelles highway, and there overflowed in a large pool in front ofthe abatis of trees which barred the way, at a spot which is still pointedout.</p><p>It will be remembered that it was at the opposite point, in the directionof the Genappe road, that the destruction of the cuirassiers had takenplace. The thickness of the layer of bodies was proportioned to the depthof the hollow road. Towards the middle, at the point where it becamelevel, where Delort&rsquo;s division had passed, the layer of corpses wasthinner.</p><p>The nocturnal prowler whom we have just shown to the reader was going inthat direction. He was searching that vast tomb. He gazed about. He passedthe dead in some sort of hideous review. He walked with his feet in theblood.</p><p>All at once he paused.</p><p>A few paces in front of him, in the hollow road, at the point where thepile of dead came to an end, an open hand, illumined by the moon,projected from beneath that heap of men. That hand had on its fingersomething sparkling, which was a ring of gold.</p><p>The man bent over, remained in a crouching attitude for a moment, and whenhe rose there was no longer a ring on the hand.</p><p>He did not precisely rise; he remained in a stooping and frightenedattitude, with his back turned to the heap of dead, scanning the horizonon his knees, with the whole upper portion of his body supported on histwo forefingers, which rested on the earth, and his head peering above theedge of the hollow road. The jackal&rsquo;s four paws suit some actions.</p><p>Then coming to a decision, he rose to his feet.</p><p>At that moment, he gave a terrible start. He felt some one clutch him frombehind.</p><p>He wheeled round; it was the open hand, which had closed, and had seizedthe skirt of his coat.</p><p>An honest man would have been terrified; this man burst into a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only a dead body. I prefer a spook to a gendarme.&rdquo;</p><p>But the hand weakened and released him. Effort is quickly exhausted in thegrave.</p><p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; said the prowler, &ldquo;is that dead fellow alive? Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo;</p><p>He bent down again, fumbled among the heap, pushed aside everything thatwas in his way, seized the hand, grasped the arm, freed the head, pulledout the body, and a few moments later he was dragging the lifeless, or atleast the unconscious, man, through the shadows of hollow road. He was acuirassier, an officer, and even an officer of considerable rank; a largegold epaulette peeped from beneath the cuirass; this officer no longerpossessed a helmet. A furious sword-cut had scarred his face, wherenothing was discernible but blood.</p><p>However, he did not appear to have any broken limbs, and, by some happychance, if that word is permissible here, the dead had been vaulted abovehim in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed. His eyes werestill closed.</p><p>On his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the Legion of Honor.</p><p>The prowler tore off this cross, which disappeared into one of the gulfswhich he had beneath his great coat.</p><p>Then he felt of the officer&rsquo;s fob, discovered a watch there, and tookpossession of it. Next he searched his waistcoat, found a purse andpocketed it.</p><p>When he had arrived at this stage of succor which he was administering tothis dying man, the officer opened his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said feebly.</p><p>The abruptness of the movements of the man who was manipulating him, thefreshness of the night, the air which he could inhale freely, had rousedhim from his lethargy.</p><p>The prowler made no reply. He raised his head. A sound of footsteps wasaudible in the plain; some patrol was probably approaching.</p><p>The officer murmured, for the death agony was still in his voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Who won the battle?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The English,&rdquo; answered the prowler.</p><p>The officer went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Look in my pockets; you will find a watch and a purse. Take them.&rdquo;</p><p>It was already done.</p><p>The prowler executed the required feint, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There is nothing there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have been robbed,&rdquo; said the officer; &ldquo;I am sorry for that. You shouldhave had them.&rdquo;</p><p>The steps of the patrol became more and more distinct.</p><p>&ldquo;Some one is coming,&rdquo; said the prowler, with the movement of a man who istaking his departure.</p><p>The officer raised his arm feebly, and detained him.</p><p>&ldquo;You have saved my life. Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>The prowler answered rapidly, and in a low voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Like yourself, I belonged to the French army. I must leave you. If theywere to catch me, they would shoot me. I have saved your life. Now get outof the scrape yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is your rank?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sergeant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thénardier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall not forget that name,&rdquo; said the officer; &ldquo;and do you remembermine.

It must be remembered, that at thatepoch the <i>Gazette des Tribunaux</i> was not yet in existence.</p><p>We borrow the first from the <i>Drapeau Blanc</i>. It bears the date ofJuly 25, 1823.</p><p>An arrondissement of the Pas de Calais has just been the theatre of anevent quite out of the ordinary course. A man, who was a stranger in theDepartment, and who bore the name of M. Madeleine, had, thanks to the newmethods, resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry, themanufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets. He had made his fortune inthe business, and that of the arrondissement as well, we will admit. Hehad been appointed mayor, in recognition of his services. The policediscovered that M. Madeleine was no other than an ex-convict who hadbroken his ban, condemned in 1796 for theft, and named Jean Valjean. JeanValjean has been recommitted to prison. It appears that previous to hisarrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of M. Laffitte, asum of over half a million which he had lodged there, and which he had,moreover, and by perfectly legitimate means, acquired in his business. Noone has been able to discover where Jean Valjean has concealed this moneysince his return to prison at Toulon.</p><p>The second article, which enters a little more into detail, is an extractfrom the <i>Journal de Paris</i>, of the same date.</p><p>A former convict, who had been liberated, named Jean Valjean, has justappeared before the Court of Assizes of the Var, under circumstancescalculated to attract attention. This wretch had succeeded in escaping thevigilance of the police, he had changed his name, and had succeeded ingetting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns; inthis town he had established a considerable commerce. He has at last beenunmasked and arrested, thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the publicprosecutor. He had for his concubine a woman of the town, who died of ashock at the moment of his arrest. This scoundrel, who is endowed withHerculean strength, found means to escape; but three or four days afterhis flight the police laid their hands on him once more, in Paris itself,at the very moment when he was entering one of those little vehicles whichrun between the capital and the village of Montfermeil (Seine-et-Oise). Heis said to have profited by this interval of three or four days ofliberty, to withdraw a considerable sum deposited by him with one of ourleading bankers. This sum has been estimated at six or seven hundredthousand francs. If the indictment is to be trusted, he has hidden it insome place known to himself alone, and it has not been possible to layhands on it. However that may be, the said Jean Valjean has just beenbrought before the Assizes of the Department of the Var as accused ofhighway robbery accompanied with violence, about eight years ago, on theperson of one of those honest children who, as the patriarch of Ferney hassaid, in immortal verse,</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;. . . Arrive from Savoy every year,<br/>And who, with gentle hands, do clear<br/>Those long canals choked up with soot.&rdquo;</p><p class="noindent">This bandit refused to defend himself. It was proved by the skilful andeloquent representative of the public prosecutor, that the theft wascommitted in complicity with others, and that Jean Valjean was a member ofa band of robbers in the south. Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty and wascondemned to the death penalty in consequence. This criminal refused tolodge an appeal. The king, in his inexhaustible clemency, has deigned tocommute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life. Jean Valjean wasimmediately taken to the prison at Toulon.</p><p>The reader has not forgotten that Jean Valjean had religious habits at M.sur M. Some papers, among others the <i>Constitutional</i>, presented thiscommutation as a triumph of the priestly party.</p><p>Jean Valjean changed his number in the galleys. He was called 9,430.</p><p>However, and we will mention it at once in order that we may not beobliged to recur to the subject, the prosperity of M. sur M. vanished withM. Madeleine; all that he had foreseen during his night of fever andhesitation was realized; lacking him, there actually was <i>a soul lacking</i>.After this fall, there took place at M. sur M. that egotistical divisionof great existences which have fallen, that fatal dismemberment offlourishing things which is accomplished every day, obscurely, in thehuman community, and which history has noted only once, because itoccurred after the death of Alexander. Lieutenants are crowned kings;superintendents improvise manufacturers out of themselves. Enviousrivalries arose. M. Madeleine&rsquo;s vast workshops were shut; his buildingsfell to ruin, his workmen were scattered. Some of them quitted thecountry, others abandoned the trade. Thenceforth, everything was done on asmall scale, instead of on a grand scale; for lucre instead of the generalgood. There was no longer a centre; everywhere there was competition andanimosity. M. Madeleine had reigned over all and directed all. No soonerhad he fallen, than each pulled things to himself; the spirit of combatsucceeded to the spirit of organization, bitterness to cordiality, hatredof one another to the benevolence of the founder towards all; the threadswhich M. Madeleine had set were tangled and broken, the methods wereadulterated, the products were debased, confidence was killed; the marketdiminished, for lack of orders; salaries were reduced, the workshops stoodstill, bankruptcy arrived. And then there was nothing more for the poor.All had vanished.</p><p>The state itself perceived that some one had been crushed somewhere. Lessthan four years after the judgment of the Court of Assizes establishingthe identity of Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine, for the benefit of thegalleys, the cost of collecting taxes had doubled in the arrondissement ofM. sur M.; and M. de Villèle called attention to the fact in the rostrum,in the month of February, 1827.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0091" id="link2HCH0091"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;IN WHICH THE READER WILL PERUSE TWO VERSES, WHICH ARE OFTHE DEVIL&rsquo;S COMPOSITION, POSSIBLY</h3><p>Before proceeding further, it will be to the purpose to narrate in somedetail, a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch, inMontfermeil, and which is not lacking in coincidence with certainconjectures of the indictment.</p><p>There exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition,which is all the more curious and all the more precious, because a popularsuperstition in the vicinity of Paris is like an aloe in Siberia. We areamong those who respect everything which is in the nature of a rare plant.Here, then, is the superstition of Montfermeil: it is thought that thedevil, from time immemorial, has selected the forest as a hiding-place forhis treasures. Goodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter atnightfall, in secluded nooks of the forest, a black man with the air of acarter or a wood-chopper, wearing wooden shoes, clad in trousers and ablouse of linen, and recognizable by the fact, that, instead of a cap orhat, he has two immense horns on his head. This ought, in fact, to renderhim recognizable. This man is habitually engaged in digging a hole. Thereare three ways of profiting by such an encounter. The first is to approachthe man and speak to him. Then it is seen that the man is simply apeasant, that he appears black because it is nightfall; that he is notdigging any hole whatever, but is cutting grass for his cows, and thatwhat had been taken for horns is nothing but a dung-fork which he iscarrying on his back, and whose teeth, thanks to the perspective ofevening, seemed to spring from his head. The man returns home and dieswithin the week. The second way is to watch him, to wait until he has dughis hole, until he has filled it and has gone away; then to run with greatspeed to the trench, to open it once more and to seize the &ldquo;treasure&rdquo; which the black man has necessarily placed there. In this case one dieswithin the month. Finally, the last method is not to speak to the blackman, not to look at him, and to flee at the best speed of one&rsquo;s legs. Onethen dies within the year.</p><p>As all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences, thesecond, which at all events, presents some advantages, among others thatof possessing a treasure, if only for a month, is the one most generallyadopted. So bold men, who are tempted by every chance, have quitefrequently, as we are assured, opened the holes excavated by the blackman, and tried to rob the devil. The success of the operation appears tobe but moderate. At least, if the tradition is to be believed, and inparticular the two enigmatical lines in barbarous Latin, which an evilNorman monk, a bit of a sorcerer, named Tryphon has left on this subject.This Tryphon is buried at the Abbey of Saint-Georges de Bocherville, nearRouen, and toads spawn on his grave.</p><p>Accordingly, enormous efforts are made. Such trenches are ordinarilyextremely deep; a man sweats, digs, toils all night&mdash;for it must bedone at night; he wets his shirt, burns out his candle, breaks hismattock, and when he arrives at the bottom of the hole, when he lays hishand on the &ldquo;treasure,&rdquo; what does he find? What is the devil&rsquo;s treasure? Asou, sometimes a crown-piece, a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding body,sometimes a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio,sometimes nothing. This is what Tryphon&rsquo;s verses seem to announce to theindiscreet and curious:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Fodit, et in fossa thesauros condit opaca,<br/>As, nummas, lapides, cadaver, simulacra, nihilque.&rdquo;</p><p>It seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn withbullets, sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn, which hasevidently served the devil. Tryphon does not record these two finds, sinceTryphon lived in the twelfth century, and since the devil does not appearto have had the wit to invent powder before Roger Bacon&rsquo;s time, and cardsbefore the time of Charles VI.</p><p>Moreover, if one plays at cards, one is sure to lose all that onepossesses! and as for the powder in the horn, it possesses the property ofmaking your gun burst in your face.</p><p>Now, a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecutingattorney that the liberated convict Jean Valjean during his flight ofseveral days had been prowling around Montfermeil, it was remarked in thatvillage that a certain old road-laborer, named Boulatruelle, had &ldquo;peculiarways&rdquo; in the forest. People thereabouts thought they knew that thisBoulatruelle had been in the galleys. He was subjected to certain policesupervision, and, as he could find work nowhere, the administrationemployed him at reduced rates as a road-mender on the crossroad fromGagny to Lagny.</p><p>This Boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by theinhabitants of the district as too respectful, too humble, too prompt inremoving his cap to every one, and trembling and smiling in the presenceof the gendarmes,&mdash;probably affiliated to robber bands, they said;suspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall. The onlything in his favor was that he was a drunkard.</p><p>This is what people thought they had noticed:&mdash;</p><p>Of late, Boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone-breaking andcare of the road at a very early hour, and to betaking himself to theforest with his pickaxe. He was encountered towards evening in the mostdeserted clearings, in the wildest thickets; and he had the appearance ofbeing in search of something, and sometimes he was digging holes. Thegoodwives who passed took him at first for Beelzebub; then they recognizedBoulatruelle, and were not in the least reassured thereby. Theseencounters seemed to cause Boulatruelle a lively displeasure. It wasevident that he sought to hide, and that there was some mystery in what hewas doing.</p><p>It was said in the village: &ldquo;It is clear that the devil has appeared.Boulatruelle has seen him, and is on the search. In sooth, he is cunningenough to pocket Lucifer&rsquo;s hoard.&rdquo;</p><p>The Voltairians added, &ldquo;Will Boulatruelle catch the devil, or will thedevil catch Boulatruelle?&rdquo; The old women made a great many signs of thecross.</p><p>In the meantime, Boulatruelle&rsquo;s manœuvres in the forest ceased; andhe resumed his regular occupation of roadmending; and people gossiped ofsomething else.</p><p>Some persons, however, were still curious, surmising that in all thisthere was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends, but some finewindfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil&rsquo;s bank-bills,and that the road-mender had half discovered the secret. The most&ldquo;puzzled&rdquo; were the schoolmaster and Thénardier, the proprietor of thetavern, who was everybody&rsquo;s friend, and had not disdained to ally himselfwith Boulatruelle.</p><p>&ldquo;He has been in the galleys,&rdquo; said Thénardier. &ldquo;Eh! Good God! no one knowswho has been there or will be there.&rdquo;</p><p>One evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law wouldhave instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle did in the forest, andthat the latter would have been forced to speak, and that he would havebeen put to the torture in case of need, and that Boulatruelle would nothave resisted the water test, for example. &ldquo;Let us put him to the winetest,&rdquo; said Thénardier.</p><p>They made an effort, and got the old road-mender to drinking. Boulatruelledrank an enormous amount, but said very little. He combined with admirableart, and in masterly proportions, the thirst of a gormandizer with thediscretion of a judge. Nevertheless, by dint of returning to the chargeand of comparing and putting together the few obscure words which he didallow to escape him, this is what Thénardier and the schoolmaster imaginedthat they had made out:&mdash;</p><p>One morning, when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work, at daybreak, hehad been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest in the underbrush, ashovel and a pickaxe, <i>concealed, as one might say</i>.</p><p>However, he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel andpick of Father Six-Fours, the water-carrier, and would have thought nomore about it. But, on the evening of that day, he saw, without being seenhimself, as he was hidden by a large tree, &ldquo;a person who did not belong inthose parts, and whom he, Boulatruelle, knew well,&rdquo; directing his stepstowards the densest part of the wood. Translation by Thénardier: <i>Acomrade of the galleys</i>. Boulatruelle obstinately refused to reveal hisname. This person carried a package&mdash;something square, like a largebox or a small trunk. Surprise on the part of Boulatruelle. However, itwas only after the expiration of seven or eight minutes that the idea offollowing that &ldquo;person&rdquo; had occurred to him. But it was too late; theperson was already in the thicket, night had descended, and Boulatruellehad not been able to catch up with him. Then he had adopted the course ofwatching for him at the edge of the woods. &ldquo;It was moonlight.&rdquo; Two orthree hours later, Boulatruelle had seen this person emerge from thebrushwood, carrying no longer the coffer, but a shovel and pick.Boulatruelle had allowed the person to pass, and had not dreamed ofaccosting him, because he said to himself that the other man was threetimes as strong as he was, and armed with a pickaxe, and that he wouldprobably knock him over the head on recognizing him, and on perceivingthat he was recognized. Touching effusion of two old comrades on meetingagain. But the shovel and pick had served as a ray of light toBoulatruelle; he had hastened to the thicket in the morning, and had foundneither shovel nor pick. From this he had drawn the inference that thisperson, once in the forest, had dug a hole with his pick, buried thecoffer, and reclosed the hole with his shovel. Now, the coffer was toosmall to contain a body; therefore it contained money. Hence hisresearches. Boulatruelle had explored, sounded, searched the entire forestand the thicket, and had dug wherever the earth appeared to him to havebeen recently turned up. In vain.</p><p>He had &ldquo;ferreted out&rdquo; nothing. No one in Montfermeil thought any moreabout it. There were only a few brave gossips, who said, &ldquo;You may becertain that the mender on the Gagny road did not take all that troublefor nothing; he was sure that the devil had come.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0092" id="link2HCH0092"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE ANKLE-CHAIN MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CERTAINPREPARATORY MANIPULATION TO BE THUS BROKEN WITH A BLOW FROM A HAMMER</h3><p>Towards the end of October, in that same year, 1823, the inhabitants ofToulon beheld the entry into their port, after heavy weather, and for thepurpose of repairing some damages, of the ship <i>Orion</i>, which wasemployed later at Brest as a school-ship, and which then formed a part ofthe Mediterranean squadron.</p><p>This vessel, battered as it was,&mdash;for the sea had handled it roughly,&mdash;produceda fine effect as it entered the roads. It flew some colors which procuredfor it the regulation salute of eleven guns, which it returned, shot forshot; total, twenty-two. It has been calculated that what with salvos,royal and military politenesses, courteous exchanges of uproar, signals ofetiquette, formalities of roadsteads and citadels, sunrises and sunsets,saluted every day by all fortresses and all ships of war, openings andclosings of ports, etc., the civilized world, discharged all over theearth, in the course of four and twenty hours, one hundred and fiftythousand useless shots. At six francs the shot, that comes to nine hundredthousand francs a day, three hundred millions a year, which vanish insmoke. This is a mere detail. All this time the poor were dying of hunger.</p><p>The year 1823 was what the Restoration called &ldquo;the epoch of the Spanishwar.&rdquo;</p><p>This war contained many events in one, and a quantity of peculiarities. Agrand family affair for the house of Bourbon; the branch of Francesuccoring and protecting the branch of Madrid, that is to say, performingan act devolving on the elder; an apparent return to our nationaltraditions, complicated by servitude and by subjection to the cabinets ofthe North; M. le Duc d&rsquo;Angoulême, surnamed by the liberal sheets <i>thehero of Andujar</i>, compressing in a triumphal attitude that was somewhatcontradicted by his peaceable air, the ancient and very powerful terrorismof the Holy Office at variance with the chimerical terrorism of theliberals; the <i>sansculottes</i> resuscitated, to the great terror ofdowagers, under the name of <i>descamisados</i>; monarchy opposing anobstacle to progress described as anarchy; the theories of &rsquo;89 roughlyinterrupted in the sap; a European halt, called to the French idea, whichwas making the tour of the world; beside the son of France asgeneralissimo, the Prince de Carignan, afterwards Charles Albert,enrolling himself in that crusade of kings against people as a volunteer,with grenadier epaulets of red worsted; the soldiers of the Empire settingout on a fresh campaign, but aged, saddened, after eight years of repose,and under the white cockade; the tricolored standard waved abroad by aheroic handful of Frenchmen, as the white standard had been thirty yearsearlier at Coblentz; monks mingled with our troops; the spirit of libertyand of novelty brought to its senses by bayonets; principles slaughteredby cannonades; France undoing by her arms that which she had done by hermind; in addition to this, hostile leaders sold, soldiers hesitating,cities besieged by millions; no military perils, and yet possibleexplosions, as in every mine which is surprised and invaded; but littlebloodshed, little honor won, shame for some, glory for no one. Such wasthis war, made by the princes descended from Louis XIV., and conducted bygenerals who had been under Napoleon. Its sad fate was to recall neitherthe grand war nor grand politics.</p><p>Some feats of arms were serious; the taking of the Trocadéro, amongothers, was a fine military action; but after all, we repeat, the trumpetsof this war give back a cracked sound, the whole effect was suspicious;history approves of France for making a difficulty about accepting thisfalse triumph. It seemed evident that certain Spanish officers chargedwith resistance yielded too easily; the idea of corruption was connectedwith the victory; it appears as though generals and not battles had beenwon, and the conquering soldier returned humiliated. A debasing war, inshort, in which the <i>Bank of France</i> could be read in the folds ofthe flag.</p><p>Soldiers of the war of 1808, on whom Saragossa had fallen in formidableruin, frowned in 1823 at the easy surrender of citadels, and began toregret Palafox. It is the nature of France to prefer to have Rostopchinerather than Ballesteros in front of her.</p><p>From a still more serious point of view, and one which it is also properto insist upon here, this war, which wounded the military spirit ofFrance, enraged the democratic spirit. It was an enterprise ofenthralment. In that campaign, the object of the French soldier, the sonof democracy, was the conquest of a yoke for others. A hideouscontradiction. France is made to arouse the soul of nations, not to stifleit. All the revolutions of Europe since 1792 are the French Revolution:liberty darts rays from France. That is a solar fact. Blind is he who willnot see! It was Bonaparte who said it.</p><p>The war of 1823, an outrage on the generous Spanish nation, was then, atthe same time, an outrage on the French Revolution. It was France whocommitted this monstrous violence; by foul means, for, with the exceptionof wars of liberation, everything that armies do is by foul means. Thewords <i>passive obedience</i> indicate this. An army is a strangemasterpiece of combination where force results from an enormous sum ofimpotence. Thus is war, made by humanity against humanity, despitehumanity, explained.</p><p>As for the Bourbons, the war of 1823 was fatal to them. They took it for asuccess. They did not perceive the danger that lies in having an ideaslain to order. They went astray, in their innocence, to such a degreethat they introduced the immense enfeeblement of a crime into theirestablishment as an element of strength. The spirit of the ambush enteredinto their politics. 1830 had its germ in 1823. The Spanish campaignbecame in their counsels an argument for force and for adventures by rightDivine. France, having re-established <i>el rey netto</i> in Spain, mightwell have re-established the absolute king at home. They fell into thealarming error of taking the obedience of the soldier for the consent ofthe nation. Such confidence is the ruin of thrones. It is not permitted tofall asleep, either in the shadow of a machineel tree, nor in the shadowof an army.</p><p>Let us return to the ship <i>Orion</i>.</p><p>During the operations of the army commanded by the prince generalissimo, asquadron had been cruising in the Mediterranean. We have just stated thatthe <i>Orion</i> belonged to this fleet, and that accidents of the sea hadbrought it into port at Toulon.</p><p>The presence of a vessel of war in a port has something about it whichattracts and engages a crowd. It is because it is great, and the crowdloves what is great.</p><p>A ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations of thegenius of man with the powers of nature.</p><p>A ship of the line is composed, at the same time, of the heaviest and thelightest of possible matter, for it deals at one and the same time withthree forms of substance,&mdash;solid, liquid, and fluid,&mdash;and itmust do battle with all three. It has eleven claws of iron with which toseize the granite on the bottom of the sea, and more wings and moreantennæ than winged insects, to catch the wind in the clouds. Its breathpours out through its hundred and twenty cannons as through enormoustrumpets, and replies proudly to the thunder. The ocean seeks to lead itastray in the alarming sameness of its billows, but the vessel has itssoul, its compass, which counsels it and always shows it the north. In theblackest nights, its lanterns supply the place of the stars. Thus, againstthe wind, it has its cordage and its canvas; against the water, wood;against the rocks, its iron, brass, and lead; against the shadows, itslight; against immensity, a needle.</p><p>If one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions which,taken as a whole, constitute the ship of the line, one has only to enterone of the six-story covered construction stocks, in the ports of Brest orToulon. The vessels in process of construction are under a bell-glassthere, as it were. This colossal beam is a yard; that great column of woodwhich stretches out on the earth as far as the eye can reach is themain-mast. Taking it from its root in the stocks to its tip in the clouds,it is sixty fathoms long, and its diameter at its base is three feet. TheEnglish main-mast rises to a height of two hundred and seventeen feetabove the water-line. The navy of our fathers employed cables, oursemploys chains. The simple pile of chains on a ship of a hundred guns isfour feet high, twenty feet in breadth, and eight feet in depth. And howmuch wood is required to make this ship? Three thousand cubic metres. Itis a floating forest.</p><p>And moreover, let this be borne in mind, it is only a question here of themilitary vessel of forty years ago, of the simple sailing-vessel; steam,then in its infancy, has since added new miracles to that prodigy which iscalled a war vessel. At the present time, for example, the mixed vesselwith a screw is a surprising machine, propelled by three thousand squaremetres of canvas and by an engine of two thousand five hundredhorse-power.</p><p>Not to mention these new marvels, the ancient vessel of ChristopherColumbus and of De Ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man. It is asinexhaustible in force as is the Infinite in gales; it stores up the windin its sails, it is precise in the immense vagueness of the billows, itfloats, and it reigns.</p><p>There comes an hour, nevertheless, when the gale breaks that sixty-footyard like a straw, when the wind bends that mast four hundred feet tall,when that anchor, which weighs tens of thousands, is twisted in the jawsof the waves like a fisherman&rsquo;s hook in the jaws of a pike, when thosemonstrous cannons utter plaintive and futile roars, which the hurricanebears forth into the void and into night, when all that power and all thatmajesty are engulfed in a power and majesty which are superior.</p><p>Every time that immense force is displayed to culminate in an immensefeebleness it affords men food for thought. Hence in the ports curiouspeople abound around these marvellous machines of war and of navigation,without being able to explain perfectly to themselves why. Every day,accordingly, from morning until night, the quays, sluices, and the jettiesof the port of Toulon were covered with a multitude of idlers andloungers, as they say in Paris, whose business consisted in staring at the<i>Orion</i>.</p><p>The <i>Orion</i> was a ship that had been ailing for a long time; in thecourse of its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles had collected onits keel to such a degree as to deprive it of half its speed; it had goneinto the dry dock the year before this, in order to have the barnaclesscraped off, then it had put to sea again; but this cleaning had affectedthe bolts of the keel: in the neighborhood of the Balearic Isles the sideshad been strained and had opened; and, as the plating in those days wasnot of sheet iron, the vessel had sprung a leak. A violent equinoctialgale had come up, which had first staved in a grating and a porthole onthe larboard side, and damaged the foretop-gallant-shrouds; in consequenceof these injuries, the <i>Orion</i> had run back to Toulon.</p><p>It anchored near the Arsenal; it was fully equipped, and repairs werebegun. The hull had received no damage on the starboard, but some of theplanks had been unnailed here and there, according to custom, to permit ofair entering the hold.</p><p>One morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0015" id="linkimage-0015"></a><img src="images/2b2-1-the-ship-orion.jpg" alt="The Ship Orion, an Accident" width="100%" /></div><p>The crew was busy bending the sails; the topman, who had to take the uppercorner of the main-top-sail on the starboard, lost his balance; he wasseen to waver; the multitude thronging the Arsenal quay uttered a cry; theman&rsquo;s head overbalanced his body; the man fell around the yard, with hishands outstretched towards the abyss; on his way he seized the footrope,first with one hand, then with the other, and remained hanging from it:the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth; the shock of his fall had impartedto the foot-rope a violent swinging motion; the man swayed back and forthat the end of that rope, like a stone in a sling.</p><p>It was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance; not one of thesailors, all fishermen of the coast, recently levied for the service,dared to attempt it. In the meantime, the unfortunate topman was losinghis strength; his anguish could not be discerned on his face, but hisexhaustion was visible in every limb; his arms were contracted in horribletwitchings; every effort which he made to re-ascend served but to augmentthe oscillations of the foot-rope; he did not shout, for fear ofexhausting his strength. All were awaiting the minute when he shouldrelease his hold on the rope, and, from instant to instant, heads wereturned aside that his fall might not be seen. There are moments when a bitof rope, a pole, the branch of a tree, is life itself, and it is aterrible thing to see a living being detach himself from it and fall likea ripe fruit.</p><p>All at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the agility of atiger-cat; this man was dressed in red; he was a convict; he wore a greencap; he was a life convict. On arriving on a level with the top, a gust ofwind carried away his cap, and allowed a perfectly white head to be seen:he was not a young man.</p><p>A convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had, infact, at the very first instant, hastened to the officer of the watch,and, in the midst of the consternation and the hesitation of the crew,while all the sailors were trembling and drawing back, he had asked theofficer&rsquo;s permission to risk his life to save the topman; at anaffirmative sign from the officer he had broken the chain riveted to hisankle with one blow of a hammer, then he had caught up a rope, and haddashed into the rigging: no one noticed, at the instant, with what easethat chain had been broken; it was only later on that the incident wasrecalled.</p><p>In a twinkling he was on the yard; he paused for a few seconds andappeared to be measuring it with his eye; these seconds, during which thebreeze swayed the topman at the extremity of a thread, seemed centuries tothose who were looking on. At last, the convict raised his eyes to heavenand advanced a step: the crowd drew a long breath. He was seen to run outalong the yard: on arriving at the point, he fastened the rope which hehad brought to it, and allowed the other end to hang down, then he beganto descend the rope, hand over hand, and then,&mdash;and the anguish wasindescribable,&mdash;instead of one man suspended over the gulf, therewere two.</p><p>One would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly, only here thespider brought life, not death. Ten thousand glances were fastened on thisgroup; not a cry, not a word; the same tremor contracted every brow; allmouths held their breath as though they feared to add the slightest puffto the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate men.</p><p>In the meantime, the convict had succeeded in lowering himself to aposition near the sailor. It was high time; one minute more, and theexhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall into theabyss. The convict had moored him securely with the cord to which he clungwith one hand, while he was working with the other. At last, he was seento climb back on the yard, and to drag the sailor up after him; he heldhim there a moment to allow him to recover his strength, then he graspedhim in his arms and carried him, walking on the yard himself to the cap,and from there to the main-top, where he left him in the hands of hiscomrades.</p><p>At that moment the crowd broke into applause: old convict-sergeants amongthem wept, and women embraced each other on the quay, and all voices wereheard to cry with a sort of tender rage, &ldquo;Pardon for that man!&rdquo;</p><p>He, in the meantime, had immediately begun to make his descent to rejoinhis detachment. In order to reach them the more speedily, he dropped intothe rigging, and ran along one of the lower yards; all eyes were followinghim. At a certain moment fear assailed them; whether it was that he wasfatigued, or that his head turned, they thought they saw him hesitate andstagger. All at once the crowd uttered a loud shout: the convict hadfallen into the sea.</p><p>The fall was perilous. The frigate <i>Algésiras</i> was anchored alongsidethe <i>Orion</i>, and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels:it was to be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them.Four men flung themselves hastily into a boat; the crowd cheered them on;anxiety again took possession of all souls; the man had not risen to thesurface; he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple, as thoughhe had fallen into a cask of oil: they sounded, they dived. In vain. Thesearch was continued until the evening: they did not even find the body.</p><p>On the following day the Toulon newspaper printed these lines:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Nov. 17, 1823. Yesterday, a convict belonging to the detachment on boardof the <i>Orion</i>, on his return from rendering assistance to a sailor,fell into the sea and was drowned. The body has not yet been found; it issupposed that it is entangled among the piles of the Arsenal point: thisman was committed under the number 9,430, and his name was Jean Valjean.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0108" id="link2H_4_0108"></a>BOOK THIRD&mdash;ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE PROMISE MADE TO THE DEAD WOMAN</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0093" id="link2HCH0093"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE WATER QUESTION AT MONTFERMEIL</h3><p>Montfermeil is situated between Livry and Chelles, on the southern edge ofthat lofty table-land which separates the Ourcq from the Marne. At thepresent day it is a tolerably large town, ornamented all the year throughwith plaster villas, and on Sundays with beaming bourgeois. In 1823 therewere at Montfermeil neither so many white houses nor so manywell-satisfied citizens: it was only a village in the forest. Somepleasure-houses of the last century were to be met with there, to be sure,which were recognizable by their grand air, their balconies in twistediron, and their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all sorts of varyingshades of green on the white of the closed shutters; but Montfermeil wasnonetheless a village. Retired cloth-merchants and rusticating attorneyshad not discovered it as yet; it was a peaceful and charming place, whichwas not on the road to anywhere: there people lived, and cheaply, thatpeasant rustic life which is so bounteous and so easy; only, water wasrare there, on account of the elevation of the plateau.</p><p>It was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance; the end of thevillage towards Gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds whichexist in the woods there. The other end, which surrounds the church andwhich lies in the direction of Chelles, found drinking-water only at alittle spring half-way down the slope, near the road to Chelles, about aquarter of an hour from Montfermeil.</p><p>Thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water. Thelarge houses, the aristocracy, of which the Thénardier tavern formed apart, paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a business of it,and who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise of supplyingMontfermeil with water; but this good man only worked until seven o&rsquo;clockin the evening in summer, and five in winter; and night once come and theshutters on the ground floor once closed, he who had no water to drinkwent to fetch it for himself or did without it.</p><p>This constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader hasprobably not forgotten,&mdash;little Cosette. It will be remembered thatCosette was useful to the Thénardiers in two ways: they made the motherpay them, and they made the child serve them. So when the mother ceased topay altogether, the reason for which we have read in preceding chapters,the Thénardiers kept Cosette. She took the place of a servant in theirhouse. In this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when it wasrequired. So the child, who was greatly terrified at the idea of going tothe spring at night, took great care that water should never be lacking inthe house.</p><p>Christmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil. Thebeginning of the winter had been mild; there had been neither snow norfrost up to that time. Some mountebanks from Paris had obtained permissionof the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street of the village,and a band of itinerant merchants, under protection of the same tolerance,had constructed their stalls on the Church Square, and even extended theminto Boulanger Alley, where, as the reader will perhaps remember, theThénardiers&rsquo; hostelry was situated. These people filled the inns anddrinking-shops, and communicated to that tranquil little district a noisyand joyous life. In order to play the part of a faithful historian, weought even to add that, among the curiosities displayed in the square,there was a menagerie, in which frightful clowns, clad in rags and comingno one knew whence, exhibited to the peasants of Montfermeil in 1823 oneof those horrible Brazilian vultures, such as our Royal Museum did notpossess until 1845, and which have a tricolored cockade for an eye. Ibelieve that naturalists call this bird Caracara Polyborus; it belongs tothe order of the Apicides, and to the family of the vultures. Some goodold Bonapartist soldiers, who had retired to the village, went to see thiscreature with great devotion. The mountebanks gave out that the tricoloredcockade was a unique phenomenon made by God expressly for their menagerie.</p><p>On Christmas eve itself, a number of men, carters, and peddlers, wereseated at table, drinking and smoking around four or five candles in thepublic room of Thénardier&rsquo;s hostelry. This room resembled alldrinking-shop rooms,&mdash;tables, pewter jugs, bottles, drinkers,smokers; but little light and a great deal of noise. The date of the year1823 was indicated, nevertheless, by two objects which were thenfashionable in the bourgeois class: to wit, a kaleidoscope and a lamp ofribbed tin. The female Thénardier was attending to the supper, which wasroasting in front of a clear fire; her husband was drinking with hiscustomers and talking politics.</p><p>Besides political conversations which had for their principal subjects theSpanish war and M. le Duc d&rsquo;Angoulême, strictly local parentheses, likethe following, were audible amid the uproar:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;About Nanterre and Suresnes the vines have flourished greatly. When tenpieces were reckoned on there have been twelve. They have yielded a greatdeal of juice under the press.&rdquo; &ldquo;But the grapes cannot be ripe?&rdquo; &ldquo;In thoseparts the grapes should not be ripe; the wine turns oily as soon as springcomes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then it is very thin wine?&rdquo; &ldquo;There are wines poorer even thanthese. The grapes must be gathered while green.&rdquo; Etc.</p><p>Or a miller would call out:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Are we responsible for what is in the sacks? We find in them a quantityof small seed which we cannot sift out, and which we are obliged to sendthrough the mill-stones; there are tares, fennel, vetches, hempseed,fox-tail, and a host of other weeds, not to mention pebbles, which aboundin certain wheat, especially in Breton wheat. I am not fond of grindingBreton wheat, any more than long-sawyers like to saw beams with nails inthem. You can judge of the bad dust that makes in grinding. And thenpeople complain of the flour. They are in the wrong. The flour is no faultof ours.&rdquo;</p><p>In a space between two windows a mower, who was seated at table with alanded proprietor who was fixing on a price for some meadow work to beperformed in the spring, was saying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It does no harm to have the grass wet. It cuts better. Dew is a goodthing, sir. It makes no difference with that grass. Your grass is youngand very hard to cut still. It&rsquo;s terribly tender. It yields before theiron.&rdquo; Etc.</p><p>Cosette was in her usual place, seated on the cross-bar of the kitchentable near the chimney. She was in rags; her bare feet were thrust intowooden shoes, and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollenstockings destined for the young Thénardiers. A very young kitten wasplaying about among the chairs. Laughter and chatter were audible in theadjoining room, from two fresh children&rsquo;s voices: it was Éponine andAzelma.</p><p>In the chimney-corner a cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails was hanging on a nail.</p><p>At intervals the cry of a very young child, which was somewhere in thehouse, rang through the noise of the dram-shop. It was a little boy whohad been born to the Thénardiers during one of the preceding winters,&mdash;&ldquo;shedid not know why,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the result of the cold,&rdquo;&mdash;and who was alittle more than three years old. The mother had nursed him, but she didnot love him. When the persistent clamor of the brat became too annoying,&ldquo;Your son is squalling,&rdquo; Thénardier would say; &ldquo;do go and see what hewants.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; the mother would reply, &ldquo;he bothers me.&rdquo; And the neglectedchild continued to shriek in the dark.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0094" id="link2HCH0094"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;TWO COMPLETE PORTRAITS</h3><p>So far in this book the Thénardiers have been viewed only in profile; themoment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple, and consideringit under all its aspects.</p><p>Thénardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Thénardier wasapproaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a woman; so thatthere existed a balance of age between husband and wife.</p><p>Our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this Thénardierwoman, ever since her first appearance,&mdash;tall, blond, red, fat,angular, square, enormous, and agile; she belonged, as we have said, tothe race of those colossal wild women, who contort themselves at fairswith paving-stones hanging from their hair. She did everything about thehouse,&mdash;made the beds, did the washing, the cooking, and everythingelse. Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the service of an elephant.Everything trembled at the sound of her voice,&mdash;window panes,furniture, and people. Her big face, dotted with red blotches, presentedthe appearance of a skimmer. She had a beard. She was an idealmarket-porter dressed in woman&rsquo;s clothes. She swore splendidly; sheboasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist. Except forthe romances which she had read, and which made the affected lady peepthrough the ogress at times, in a very queer way, the idea would neverhave occurred to any one to say of her, &ldquo;That is a woman.&rdquo; This Thénardierfemale was like the product of a wench engrafted on a fishwife. When oneheard her speak, one said, &ldquo;That is a gendarme&rdquo;; when one saw her drink,one said, &ldquo;That is a carter&rdquo;; when one saw her handle Cosette, one said,&ldquo;That is the hangman.&rdquo; One of her teeth projected when her face was inrepose.</p><p>Thénardier was a small, thin, pale, angular, bony, feeble man, who had asickly air and who was wonderfully healthy. His cunning began here; hesmiled habitually, by way of precaution, and was almost polite toeverybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing. He hadthe glance of a pole-cat and the bearing of a man of letters. He greatlyresembled the portraits of the Abbé Delille. His coquetry consisted indrinking with the carters. No one had ever succeeded in rendering himdrunk. He smoked a big pipe. He wore a blouse, and under his blouse an oldblack coat. He made pretensions to literature and to materialism. Therewere certain names which he often pronounced to support whatever things hemight be saying,&mdash;Voltaire, Raynal, Parny, and, singularly enough,Saint Augustine. He declared that he had &ldquo;a system.&rdquo; In addition, he was agreat swindler. A <i>filousophe</i> [philosophe], a scientific thief. Thespecies does exist. It will be remembered that he pretended to have servedin the army; he was in the habit of relating with exuberance, how, being asergeant in the 6th or the 9th light something or other, at Waterloo, hehad alone, and in the presence of a squadron of death-dealing hussars,covered with his body and saved from death, in the midst of thegrape-shot, &ldquo;a general, who had been dangerously wounded.&rdquo; Thence arosefor his wall the flaring sign, and for his inn the name which it bore inthe neighborhood, of &ldquo;the cabaret of the Sergeant of Waterloo.&rdquo; He was aliberal, a classic, and a Bonapartist. He had subscribed for the Champd&rsquo;Asile. It was said in the village that he had studied for thepriesthood.</p><p>We believe that he had simply studied in Holland for an inn-keeper. Thisrascal of composite order was, in all probability, some Fleming fromLille, in Flanders, a Frenchman in Paris, a Belgian at Brussels, beingcomfortably astride of both frontiers. As for his prowess at Waterloo, thereader is already acquainted with that. It will be perceived that heexaggerated it a trifle. Ebb and flow, wandering, adventure, was the levenof his existence; a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary life, and,apparently at the stormy epoch of June 18, 1815, Thénardier belonged tothat variety of marauding sutlers of which we have spoken, beating aboutthe country, selling to some, stealing from others, and travelling like afamily man, with wife and children, in a rickety cart, in the rear oftroops on the march, with an instinct for always attaching himself to thevictorious army. This campaign ended, and having, as he said, &ldquo;somequibus,&rdquo; he had come to Montfermeil and set up an inn there.</p><p>This <i>quibus</i>, composed of purses and watches, of gold rings andsilver crosses, gathered in harvest-time in furrows sown with corpses, didnot amount to a large total, and did not carry this sutler turnedeating-house-keeper very far.</p><p>Thénardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestures which,accompanied by an oath, recalls the barracks, and by a sign of the cross, theseminary.

Nevertheless, the schoolmaster had noticed that he pronouncedimproperly.<a href="#linknote-12" name="linknoteref-12" id="linknoteref-12">12</a></p><p>He composed the travellers&rsquo; tariff card in a superior manner, butpractised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it. Thénardierwas cunning, greedy, slothful, and clever. He did not disdain hisservants, which caused his wife to dispense with them. This giantess wasjealous. It seemed to her that that thin and yellow little man must be anobject coveted by all.</p><p>Thénardier, who was, above all, an astute and well-balanced man, was ascamp of a temperate sort. This is the worst species; hypocrisy entersinto it.</p><p>It is not that Thénardier was not, on occasion, capable of wrath to quitethe same degree as his wife; but this was very rare, and at such times,since he was enraged with the human race in general, as he bore within hima deep furnace of hatred. And since he was one of those people who arecontinually avenging their wrongs, who accuse everything that passesbefore them of everything which has befallen them, and who are alwaysready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand, as a legitimategrievance, the sum total of the deceptions, the bankruptcies, and thecalamities of their lives,&mdash;when all this leaven was stirred up inhim and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes, he was terrible. Woe to theperson who came under his wrath at such a time!</p><p>In addition to his other qualities, Thénardier was attentive andpenetrating, silent or talkative, according to circumstances, and alwayshighly intelligent. He had something of the look of sailors, who areaccustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses.Thénardier was a statesman.</p><p>Every newcomer who entered the tavern said, on catching sight of MadameThénardier, &ldquo;There is the master of the house.&rdquo; A mistake. She was noteven the mistress. The husband was both master and mistress. She worked;he created. He directed everything by a sort of invisible and constantmagnetic action. A word was sufficient for him, sometimes a sign; themastodon obeyed. Thénardier was a sort of special and sovereign being inMadame Thénardier&rsquo;s eyes, though she did not thoroughly realize it. Shewas possessed of virtues after her own kind; if she had ever had adisagreement as to any detail with &ldquo;Monsieur Thénardier,&rdquo;&mdash;which wasan inadmissible hypothesis, by the way,&mdash;she would not have blamedher husband in public on any subject whatever. She would never havecommitted &ldquo;before strangers&rdquo; that mistake so often committed by women, andwhich is called in parliamentary language, &ldquo;exposing the crown.&rdquo; Althoughtheir concord had only evil as its result, there was contemplation inMadame Thénardier&rsquo;s submission to her husband. That mountain of noise andof flesh moved under the little finger of that frail despot. Viewed on itsdwarfed and grotesque side, this was that grand and universal thing, theadoration of mind by matter; for certain ugly features have a cause in thevery depths of eternal beauty. There was an unknown quantity aboutThénardier; hence the absolute empire of the man over that woman. Atcertain moments she beheld him like a lighted candle; at others she felthim like a claw.</p><p>This woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except her children,and who did not fear any one except her husband. She was a mother becauseshe was mammiferous. But her maternity stopped short with her daughters,and, as we shall see, did not extend to boys. The man had but one thought,&mdash;howto enrich himself.</p><p>He did not succeed in this. A theatre worthy of this great talent waslacking. Thénardier was ruining himself at Montfermeil, if ruin ispossible to zero; in Switzerland or in the Pyrenees this penniless scampwould have become a millionaire; but an inn-keeper must browse where fatehas hitched him.</p><p>It will be understood that the word <i>inn-keeper</i> is here employed ina restricted sense, and does not extend to an entire class.</p><p>In this same year, 1823, Thénardier was burdened with about fifteenhundred francs&rsquo; worth of petty debts, and this rendered him anxious.</p><p>Whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case,Thénardier was one of those men who understand best, with the mostprofundity and in the most modern fashion, that thing which is a virtueamong barbarous peoples and an object of merchandise among civilizedpeoples,&mdash;hospitality. Besides, he was an admirable poacher, andquoted for his skill in shooting. He had a certain cold and tranquillaugh, which was particularly dangerous.</p><p>His theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes. Hehad professional aphorisms, which he inserted into his wife&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;Theduty of the inn-keeper,&rdquo; he said to her one day, violently, and in a lowvoice, &ldquo;is to sell to the first comer, stews, repose, light, fire, dirtysheets, a servant, lice, and a smile; to stop passers-by, to empty smallpurses, and to honestly lighten heavy ones; to shelter travelling familiesrespectfully: to shave the man, to pluck the woman, to pick the childclean; to quote the window open, the window shut, the chimney-corner, thearmchair, the chair, the ottoman, the stool, the feather-bed, themattress and the truss of straw; to know how much the shadow uses up themirror, and to put a price on it; and, by five hundred thousand devils, tomake the traveller pay for everything, even for the flies which his dogeats!&rdquo;</p><p>This man and this woman were ruse and rage wedded&mdash;a hideous andterrible team.</p><p>While the husband pondered and combined, Madame Thénardier thought not ofabsent creditors, took no heed of yesterday nor of to-morrow, and lived ina fit of anger, all in a minute.</p><p>Such were these two beings. Cosette was between them, subjected to theirdouble pressure, like a creature who is at the same time being ground upin a mill and pulled to pieces with pincers. The man and the woman eachhad a different method: Cosette was overwhelmed with blows&mdash;this wasthe woman&rsquo;s; she went barefooted in winter&mdash;that was the man&rsquo;s doing.</p><p>Cosette ran upstairs and down, washed, swept, rubbed, dusted, ran,fluttered about, panted, moved heavy articles, and weak as she was, didthe coarse work. There was no mercy for her; a fierce mistress andvenomous master. The Thénardier hostelry was like a spider&rsquo;s web, in whichCosette had been caught, and where she lay trembling. The ideal ofoppression was realized by this sinister household. It was something likethe fly serving the spiders.</p><p>The poor child passively held her peace.</p><p>What takes place within these souls when they have but just quitted God,find themselves thus, at the very dawn of life, very small and in themidst of men all naked!</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0095" id="link2HCH0095"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;MEN MUST HAVE WINE, AND HORSES MUST HAVE WATER</h3><p>Four new travellers had arrived.</p><p>Cosette was meditating sadly; for, although she was only eight years old,she had already suffered so much that she reflected with the lugubriousair of an old woman. Her eye was black in consequence of a blow fromMadame Thénardier&rsquo;s fist, which caused the latter to remark from time totime, &ldquo;How ugly she is with her fist-blow on her eye!&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette was thinking that it was dark, very dark, that the pitchers andcaraffes in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must have beenfilled and that there was no more water in the cistern.</p><p>She was somewhat reassured because no one in the Thénardier establishmentdrank much water. Thirsty people were never lacking there; but theirthirst was of the sort which applies to the jug rather than to thepitcher. Any one who had asked for a glass of water among all thoseglasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these men. But therecame a moment when the child trembled; Madame Thénardier raised the coverof a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove, then seized a glass andbriskly approached the cistern. She turned the faucet; the child hadraised her head and was following all the woman&rsquo;s movements. A thin streamof water trickled from the faucet, and half filled the glass. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; saidshe, &ldquo;there is no more water!&rdquo; A momentary silence ensued. The child didnot breathe.</p><p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; resumed Madame Thénardier, examining the half-filled glass, &ldquo;thiswill be enough.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette applied herself to her work once more, but for a quarter of anhour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big snow-flake.</p><p>She counted the minutes that passed in this manner, and wished it were thenext morning.</p><p>From time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street, andexclaimed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as black as an oven!&rdquo; or, &ldquo;One must needs be a cat to goabout the streets without a lantern at this hour!&rdquo; And Cosette trembled.</p><p>All at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry entered, andsaid in a harsh voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My horse has not been watered.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it has,&rdquo; said Madame Thénardier.</p><p>&ldquo;I tell you that it has not,&rdquo; retorted the pedler.</p><p>Cosette had emerged from under the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the horse has had a drink; he drank out of abucket, a whole bucketful, and it was I who took the water to him, and Ispoke to him.&rdquo;</p><p>It was not true; Cosette lied.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house,&rdquo; exclaimed the pedler. &ldquo;I tell you that he has not been watered, you littlejade!

Thesebooths were all illuminated, because the citizens would soon pass on theirway to the midnight mass, with candles burning in paper funnels, which, asthe schoolmaster, then seated at the table at the Thénardiers&rsquo; observed,produced &ldquo;a magical effect.&rdquo; In compensation, not a star was visible inthe sky.</p><p>The last of these stalls, established precisely opposite the Thénardiers&rsquo;door, was a toy-shop all glittering with tinsel, glass, and magnificentobjects of tin. In the first row, and far forwards, the merchant hadplaced on a background of white napkins, an immense doll, nearly two feethigh, who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe, with gold wheat-ears on herhead, which had real hair and enamel eyes. All that day, this marvel hadbeen displayed to the wonderment of all passers-by under ten years of age,without a mother being found in Montfermeil sufficiently rich orsufficiently extravagant to give it to her child. Éponine and Azelma hadpassed hours in contemplating it, and Cosette herself had ventured to casta glance at it, on the sly, it is true.</p><p>At the moment when Cosette emerged, bucket in hand, melancholy andovercome as she was, she could not refrain from lifting her eyes to thatwonderful doll, towards <i>the lady</i>, as she called it. The poor childpaused in amazement. She had not yet beheld that doll close to. The wholeshop seemed a palace to her: the doll was not a doll; it was a vision. Itwas joy, splendor, riches, happiness, which appeared in a sort ofchimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly engulfed ingloomy and chilly misery. With the sad and innocent sagacity of childhood,Cosette measured the abyss which separated her from that doll. She said toherself that one must be a queen, or at least a princess, to have a&ldquo;thing&rdquo; like that. She gazed at that beautiful pink dress, that beautifulsmooth hair, and she thought, &ldquo;How happy that doll must be!&rdquo; She could nottake her eyes from that fantastic stall. The more she looked, the moredazzled she grew. She thought she was gazing at paradise. There were otherdolls behind the large one, which seemed to her to be fairies and genii.The merchant, who was pacing back and forth in front of his shop, producedon her somewhat the effect of being the Eternal Father.</p><p>In this adoration she forgot everything, even the errand with which shewas charged.</p><p>All at once the Thénardier&rsquo;s coarse voice recalled her to reality: &ldquo;What,you silly jade! you have not gone? Wait! I&rsquo;ll give it to you! I want toknow what you are doing there! Get along, you little monster!&rdquo;</p><p>The Thénardier had cast a glance into the street, and had caught sight ofCosette in her ecstasy.</p><p>Cosette fled, dragging her pail, and taking the longest strides of whichshe was capable.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0097" id="link2HCH0097"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;THE LITTLE ONE ALL ALONE</h3><p>As the Thénardier hostelry was in that part of the village which is nearthe church, it was to the spring in the forest in the direction of Chellesthat Cosette was obliged to go for her water.</p><p>She did not glance at the display of a single other merchant. So long asshe was in Boulanger Lane and in the neighborhood of the church, thelighted stalls illuminated the road; but soon the last light from the laststall vanished. The poor child found herself in the dark. She plunged intoit. Only, as a certain emotion overcame her, she made as much motion aspossible with the handle of the bucket as she walked along. This made anoise which afforded her company.</p><p>The further she went, the denser the darkness became. There was no one inthe streets. However, she did encounter a woman, who turned around onseeing her, and stood still, muttering between her teeth: &ldquo;Where can thatchild be going? Is it a werewolf child?&rdquo; Then the woman recognizedCosette. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the Lark!&rdquo;</p><p>In this manner Cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and desertedstreets which terminate in the village of Montfermeil on the side ofChelles. So long as she had the houses or even the walls only on bothsides of her path, she proceeded with tolerable boldness. From time totime she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of a shutter&mdash;thiswas light and life; there were people there, and it reassured her. But inproportion as she advanced, her pace slackened mechanically, as it were.When she had passed the corner of the last house, Cosette paused. It hadbeen hard to advance further than the last stall; it became impossible toproceed further than the last house. She set her bucket on the ground,thrust her hand into her hair, and began slowly to scratch her head,&mdash;agesture peculiar to children when terrified and undecided what to do. Itwas no longer Montfermeil; it was the open fields. Black and desert spacewas before her. She gazed in despair at that darkness, where there was nolonger any one, where there were beasts, where there were spectres,possibly. She took a good look, and heard the beasts walking on the grass,and she distinctly saw spectres moving in the trees. Then she seized herbucket again; fear had lent her audacity. &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I will tellhim that there was no more water!&rdquo; And she resolutely re-enteredMontfermeil.</p><p>Hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began to scratchher head again. Now it was the Thénardier who appeared to her, with herhideous, hyena mouth, and wrath flashing in her eyes. The child cast amelancholy glance before her and behind her. What was she to do? What wasto become of her? Where was she to go? In front of her was the spectre ofthe Thénardier; behind her all the phantoms of the night and of theforest. It was before the Thénardier that she recoiled. She resumed herpath to the spring, and began to run. She emerged from the village, sheentered the forest at a run, no longer looking at or listening toanything. She only paused in her course when her breath failed her; butshe did not halt in her advance. She went straight before her indesperation.</p><p>As she ran she felt like crying.</p><p>The nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely.</p><p>She no longer thought, she no longer saw. The immensity of night wasfacing this tiny creature. On the one hand, all shadow; on the other, anatom.</p><p>It was only seven or eight minutes&rsquo; walk from the edge of the woods to thespring. Cosette knew the way, through having gone over it many times indaylight. Strange to say, she did not get lost. A remnant of instinctguided her vaguely. But she did not turn her eyes either to right or toleft, for fear of seeing things in the branches and in the brushwood. Inthis manner she reached the spring.</p><p>It was a narrow, natural basin, hollowed out by the water in a clayeysoil, about two feet deep, surrounded with moss and with those tall,crimped grasses which are called Henry IV.&rsquo;s frills, and paved withseveral large stones. A brook ran out of it, with a tranquil little noise.</p><p>Cosette did not take time to breathe. It was very dark, but she was in thehabit of coming to this spring. She felt with her left hand in the darkfor a young oak which leaned over the spring, and which usually served tosupport her, found one of its branches, clung to it, bent down, andplunged the bucket in the water. She was in a state of such violentexcitement that her strength was trebled. While thus bent over, she didnot notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into thespring. The fifteen-sou piece fell into the water. Cosette neither saw norheard it fall. She drew out the bucket nearly full, and set it on thegrass.</p><p>That done, she perceived that she was worn out with fatigue. She wouldhave liked to set out again at once, but the effort required to fill thebucket had been such that she found it impossible to take a step. She wasforced to sit down. She dropped on the grass, and remained crouchingthere.</p><p>She shut her eyes; then she opened them again, without knowing why, butbecause she could not do otherwise. The agitated water in the bucketbeside her was describing circles which resembled tin serpents.</p><p>Overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds, which were likemasses of smoke. The tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend vaguely over thechild.</p><p>Jupiter was setting in the depths.</p><p>The child stared with bewildered eyes at this great star, with which shewas unfamiliar, and which terrified her. The planet was, in fact, verynear the horizon and was traversing a dense layer of mist which impartedto it a horrible ruddy hue. The mist, gloomily empurpled, magnified thestar. One would have called it a luminous wound.</p><p>A cold wind was blowing from the plain. The forest was dark, not a leafwas moving; there were none of the vague, fresh gleams of summertide.Great boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise. Slender and misshapenbushes whistled in the clearings. The tall grasses undulated like eelsunder the north wind. The nettles seemed to twist long arms furnished withclaws in search of prey. Some bits of dry heather, tossed by the breeze,flew rapidly by, and had the air of fleeing in terror before somethingwhich was coming after. On all sides there were lugubrious stretches.</p><p>The darkness was bewildering. Man requires light. Whoever buries himselfin the opposite of day feels his heart contract. When the eye sees black,the heart sees trouble. In an eclipse in the night, in the sooty opacity,there is anxiety even for the stoutest of hearts. No one walks alone inthe forest at night without trembling. Shadows and trees&mdash;twoformidable densities. A chimerical reality appears in the indistinctdepths. The inconceivable is outlined a few paces distant from you with aspectral clearness. One beholds floating, either in space or in one&rsquo;s ownbrain, one knows not what vague and intangible thing, like the dreams ofsleeping flowers. There are fierce attitudes on the horizon. One inhalesthe effluvia of the great black void. One is afraid to glance behind him,yet desirous of doing so. The cavities of night, things grown haggard,taciturn profiles which vanish when one advances, obscure dishevelments,irritated tufts, livid pools, the lugubrious reflected in the funereal,the sepulchral immensity of silence, unknown but possible beings, bendingsof mysterious branches, alarming torsos of trees, long handfuls ofquivering plants,&mdash;against all this one has no protection. There isno hardihood which does not shudder and which does not feel the vicinityof anguish. One is conscious of something hideous, as though one&rsquo;s soulwere becoming amalgamated with the darkness. This penetration of theshadows is indescribably sinister in the case of a child.</p><p>Forests are apocalypses, and the beating of the wings of a tiny soulproduces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault.</p><p>Without understanding her sensations, Cosette was conscious that she wasseized upon by that black enormity of nature; it was no longer terroralone which was gaining possession of her; it was something more terribleeven than terror; she shivered. There are no words to express thestrangeness of that shiver which chilled her to the very bottom of herheart; her eye grew wild; she thought she felt that she should not be ableto refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow.</p><p>Then, by a sort of instinct, she began to count aloud, one, two, three,four, and so on up to ten, in order to escape from that singular statewhich she did not understand, but which terrified her, and, when she hadfinished, she began again; this restored her to a true perception of thethings about her. Her hands, which she had wet in drawing the water, feltcold; she rose; her terror, a natural and unconquerable terror, hadreturned: she had but one thought now,&mdash;to flee at full speed throughthe forest, across the fields to the houses, to the windows, to thelighted candles. Her glance fell upon the water which stood before her;such was the fright which the Thénardier inspired in her, that she darednot flee without that bucket of water: she seized the handle with bothhands; she could hardly lift the pail.</p><p>In this manner she advanced a dozen paces, but the bucket was full; it washeavy; she was forced to set it on the ground once more. She took breathfor an instant, then lifted the handle of the bucket again, and resumedher march, proceeding a little further this time, but again she wasobliged to pause. After some seconds of repose she set out again. Shewalked bent forward, with drooping head, like an old woman; the weight ofthe bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms. The iron handle completedthe benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands; she was forced tohalt from time to time, and each time that she did so, the cold waterwhich splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs. This took place in thedepths of a forest, at night, in winter, far from all human sight; she wasa child of eight: no one but God saw that sad thing at the moment.</p><p>And her mother, no doubt, alas!</p><p>For there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their graves.</p><p>She panted with a sort of painful rattle; sobs contracted her throat, butshe dared not weep, so afraid was she of the Thénardier, even at adistance: it was her custom to imagine the Thénardier always present.</p><p>However, she could not make much headway in that manner, and she went onvery slowly. In spite of diminishing the length of her stops, and ofwalking as long as possible between them, she reflected with anguish thatit would take her more than an hour to return to Montfermeil in thismanner, and that the Thénardier would beat her. This anguish was mingledwith her terror at being alone in the woods at night; she was worn outwith fatigue, and had not yet emerged from the forest. On arriving near anold chestnut-tree with which she was acquainted, made a last halt, longerthan the rest, in order that she might get well rested; then she summonedup all her strength, picked up her bucket again, and courageously resumedher march, but the poor little desperate creature could not refrain fromcrying, &ldquo;O my God! my God!&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longerweighed anything at all: a hand, which seemed to her enormous, had justseized the handle, and lifted it vigorously. She raised her head. A largeblack form, straight and erect, was walking beside her through thedarkness; it was a man who had come up behind her, and whose approach shehad not heard. This man, without uttering a word, had seized the handle ofthe bucket which she was carrying.</p><p>There are instincts for all the encounters of life.</p><p>The child was not afraid.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0098" id="link2HCH0098"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;WHICH POSSIBLY PROVES BOULATRUELLE&rsquo;S INTELLIGENCE</h3><p>On the afternoon of that same Christmas Day, 1823, a man had walked forrather a long time in the most deserted part of the Boulevard de l&rsquo;Hôpitalin Paris. This man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings, and heseemed to halt, by preference, at the most modest houses on thatdilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau.</p><p>We shall see further on that this man had, in fact, hired a chamber inthat isolated quarter.</p><p>This man, in his attire, as in all his person, realized the type of whatmay be called the well-bred mendicant,&mdash;extreme wretchedness combinedwith extreme cleanliness. This is a very rare mixture which inspiresintelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the manwho is very poor, and for the man who is very worthy. He wore a very oldand very well brushed round hat; a coarse coat, worn perfectly threadbare,of an ochre yellow, a color that was not in the least eccentric at thatepoch; a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut; black breeches,worn gray at the knee, stockings of black worsted; and thick shoes withcopper buckles. He would have been pronounced a preceptor in some goodfamily, returned from the emigration. He would have been taken for morethan sixty years of age, from his perfectly white hair, his wrinkled brow,his livid lips, and his countenance, where everything breathed depressionand weariness of life. Judging from his firm tread, from the singularvigor which stamped all his movements, he would have hardly been thoughtfifty. The wrinkles on his brow were well placed, and would have disposedin his favor any one who observed him attentively. His lip contracted witha strange fold which seemed severe, and which was humble. There was in thedepth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity. In his left handhe carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief; in his right heleaned on a sort of a cudgel, cut from some hedge. This stick had beencarefully trimmed, and had an air that was not too threatening; the mosthad been made of its knots, and it had received a coral-like head, madefrom red wax: it was a cudgel, and it seemed to be a cane.</p><p>There are but few passers-by on that boulevard, particularly in thewinter. The man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them, but thiswithout any affectation.</p><p>At that epoch, King Louis XVIII. went nearly every day to Choisy-le-Roi:it was one of his favorite excursions. Towards two o&rsquo;clock, almostinvariably, the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at fullspeed along the Boulevard de l&rsquo;Hôpital.</p><p>This served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarterwho said, &ldquo;It is two o&rsquo;clock; there he is returning to the Tuileries.&rdquo;</p><p>And some rushed forward, and others drew up in line, for a passing kingalways creates a tumult; besides, the appearance and disappearance ofLouis XVIII. produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris. It wasrapid but majestic. This impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop; ashe was not able to walk, he wished to run: that cripple would gladly havehad himself drawn by the lightning. He passed, pacific and severe, in themidst of naked swords. His massive couch, all covered with gilding, withgreat branches of lilies painted on the panels, thundered noisily along.There was hardly time to cast a glance upon it. In the rear angle on theright there was visible on tufted cushions of white satin a large, firm,and ruddy face, a brow freshly powdered <i>à l&rsquo;oiseau royal</i>, a proud,hard, crafty eye, the smile of an educated man, two great epaulets withbullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat, the Golden Fleece, thecross of Saint Louis, the cross of the Legion of Honor, the silver plaqueof the Saint-Esprit, a huge belly, and a wide blue ribbon: it was theking. Outside of Paris, he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumeson his knees enwrapped in high English gaiters; when he re-entered thecity, he put on his hat and saluted rarely; he stared coldly at thepeople, and they returned it in kind. When he appeared for the first timein the Saint-Marceau quarter, the whole success which he produced iscontained in this remark of an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade,&ldquo;That big fellow yonder is the government.&rdquo;</p><p>This infallible passage of the king at the same hour was, therefore, thedaily event of the Boulevard de l&rsquo;Hôpital.</p><p>The promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the quarter,and probably did not belong in Paris, for he was ignorant as to thisdetail. When, at two o&rsquo;clock, the royal carriage, surrounded by a squadronof the body-guard all covered with silver lace, debouched on theboulevard, after having made the turn of the Salpêtrière, he appearedsurprised and almost alarmed. There was no one but himself in thiscross-lane. He drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of anenclosure, though this did not prevent M. le Duc de Havré from spying himout.</p><p>M. le Duc de Havré, as captain of the guard on duty that day, was seatedin the carriage, opposite the king. He said to his Majesty, &ldquo;Yonder is anevil-looking man.&rdquo; Members of the police, who were clearing the king&rsquo;sroute, took equal note of him: one of them received an order to followhim. But the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the faubourg,and as twilight was beginning to fall, the agent lost trace of him, as isstated in a report addressed that same evening to M. le Comte d&rsquo;Anglès,Minister of State, Prefect of Police.</p><p>When the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track, heredoubled his pace, not without turning round many a time to assurehimself that he was not being followed. At a quarter-past four, that is tosay, when night was fully come, he passed in front of the theatre of thePorte Saint-Martin, where <i>The Two Convicts</i> was being played thatday. This poster, illuminated by the theatre lanterns, struck him; for,although he was walking rapidly, he halted to read it. An instant later hewas in the blind alley of La Planchette, and he entered the <i>Platd&rsquo;Etain</i> [the Pewter Platter], where the office of the coach for Lagnywas then situated. This coach set out at half-past four. The horses wereharnessed, and the travellers, summoned by the coachman, were hastilyclimbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle.</p><p>The man inquired:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you a place?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only one&mdash;beside me on the box,&rdquo; said the coachman.</p><p>&ldquo;I will take it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Climb up.&rdquo;</p><p>Nevertheless, before setting out, the coachman cast a glance at thetraveller&rsquo;s shabby dress, at the diminutive size of his bundle, and madehim pay his fare.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going as far as Lagny?&rdquo; demanded the coachman.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>The traveller paid to Lagny.</p><p>They started. When they had passed the barrier, the coachman tried toenter into conversation, but the traveller only replied in monosyllables.The coachman took to whistling and swearing at his horses.</p><p>The coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak. It was cold. The man did notappear to be thinking of that. Thus they passed Gournay andNeuilly-sur-Marne.</p><p>Towards six o&rsquo;clock in the evening they reached Chelles. The coachman drewup in front of the carters&rsquo; inn installed in the ancient buildings of theRoyal Abbey, to give his horses a breathing spell.</p><p>&ldquo;I get down here,&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>He took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle.</p><p>An instant later he had disappeared.</p><p>He did not enter the inn.</p><p>When the coach set out for Lagny a few minutes later, it did not encounterhim in the principal street of Chelles.</p><p>The coachman turned to the inside travellers.</p><p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is a man who does not belong here, for I do not knowhim. He had not the air of owning a sou, but he does not consider money;he pays to Lagny, and he goes only as far as Chelles. It is night; all thehouses are shut; he does not enter the inn, and he is not to be found. Sohe has dived through the earth.&rdquo;</p><p>The man had not plunged into the earth, but he had gone with great stridesthrough the dark, down the principal street of Chelles, then he had turnedto the right before reaching the church, into the crossroad leading toMontfermeil, like a person who was acquainted with the country and hadbeen there before.</p><p>He followed this road rapidly. At the spot where it is intersected by theancient tree-bordered road which runs from Gagny to Lagny, he heard peoplecoming. He concealed himself precipitately in a ditch, and there waiteduntil the passers-by were at a distance. The precaution was nearlysuperfluous, however; for, as we have already said, it was a very darkDecember night. Not more than two or three stars were visible in the sky.</p><p>It is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins. The man did notreturn to the road to Montfermeil; he struck across the fields to theright, and entered the forest with long strides.</p><p>Once in the forest he slackened his pace, and began a careful examinationof all the trees, advancing, step by step, as though seeking and followinga mysterious road known to himself alone. There came a moment when heappeared to lose himself, and he paused in indecision. At last he arrived,by dint of feeling his way inch by inch, at a clearing where there was agreat heap of whitish stones. He stepped up briskly to these stones, andexamined them attentively through the mists of night, as though he werepassing them in review. A large tree, covered with those excrescenceswhich are the warts of vegetation, stood a few paces distant from the pileof stones. He went up to this tree and passed his hand over the bark ofthe trunk, as though seeking to recognize and count all the warts.</p><p>Opposite this tree, which was an ash, there was a chestnut-tree, sufferingfrom a peeling of the bark, to which a band of zinc had been nailed by wayof dressing. He raised himself on tiptoe and touched this band of zinc.</p><p>Then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space betweenthe tree and the heap of stones, like a person who is trying to assurehimself that the soil has not recently been disturbed.</p><p>That done, he took his bearings, and resumed his march through the forest.</p><p>It was the man who had just met Cosette.</p><p>As he walked through the thicket in the direction of Montfermeil, he hadespied that tiny shadow moving with a groan, depositing a burden on theground, then taking it up and setting out again. He drew near, andperceived that it was a very young child, laden with an enormous bucket ofwater. Then he approached the child, and silently grasped the handle ofthe bucket.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0099" id="link2HCH0099"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;COSETTE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE STRANGER IN THE DARK</h3><p>Cosette, as we have said, was not frightened.</p><p>The man accosted her. He spoke in a voice that was grave and almost bass.</p><p>&ldquo;My child, what you are carrying is very heavy for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette raised her head and replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;I will carry it for you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette let go of the bucket-handle. The man walked along beside her.</p><p>&ldquo;It really is very heavy,&rdquo; he muttered between his teeth. Then he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;How old are you, little one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eight, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And have you come from far like this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From the spring in the forest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going far?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A good quarter of an hour&rsquo;s walk from here.&rdquo;</p><p>The man said nothing for a moment; then he remarked abruptly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;So you have no mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the child.</p><p>Before the man had time to speak again, she added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Other people have mothers. I have none.&rdquo;</p><p>And after a silence she went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I think that I never had any.&rdquo;</p><p>The man halted; he set the bucket on the ground, bent down and placed bothhands on the child&rsquo;s shoulders, making an effort to look at her and to seeher face in the dark.</p><p>Cosette&rsquo;s thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light inthe sky.</p><p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette.&rdquo;</p><p>The man seemed to have received an electric shock. He looked at her oncemore; then he removed his hands from Cosette&rsquo;s shoulders, seized thebucket, and set out again.</p><p>After a moment he inquired:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Where do you live, little one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At Montfermeil, if you know where that is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is where we are going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused; then began again:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was Madame Thénardier.&rdquo;</p><p>The man resumed, in a voice which he strove to render indifferent, but inwhich there was, nevertheless, a singular tremor:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What does your Madame Thénardier do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is my mistress,&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;She keeps the inn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The inn?&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Well, I am going to lodge there to-night. Showme the way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We are on the way there,&rdquo; said the child.</p><p>The man walked tolerably fast. Cosette followed him without difficulty.She no longer felt any fatigue. From time to time she raised her eyestowards the man, with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribableconfidence. She had never been taught to turn to Providence and to pray;nevertheless, she felt within her something which resembled hope and joy,and which mounted towards heaven.</p><p>Several minutes elapsed. The man resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there no servant in Madame Thénardier&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you alone there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>Another pause ensued. Cosette lifted up her voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That is to say, there are two little girls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What little girls?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ponine and Zelma.&rdquo;</p><p>This was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to thefemale Thénardier.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are Ponine and Zelma?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are Madame Thénardier&rsquo;s young ladies; her daughters, as you wouldsay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what do those girls do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;they have beautiful dolls; things with gold inthem, all full of affairs. They play; they amuse themselves.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All day long?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I? I work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All day long?&rdquo;</p><p>The child raised her great eyes, in which hung a tear, which was notvisible because of the darkness, and replied gently:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>After an interval of silence she went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes, when I have finished my work and they let me, I amuse myself,too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you amuse yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the best way I can. They let me alone; but I have not many playthings.Ponine and Zelma will not let me play with their dolls. I have only alittle lead sword, no longer than that.&rdquo;</p><p>The child held up her tiny finger.</p><p>&ldquo;And it will not cut?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the child; &ldquo;it cuts salad and the heads of flies.&rdquo;</p><p>They reached the village. Cosette guided the stranger through the streets.They passed the bakeshop, but Cosette did not think of the bread which shehad been ordered to fetch. The man had ceased to ply her with questions,and now preserved a gloomy silence.</p><p>When they had left the church behind them, the man, on perceiving all theopen-air booths, asked Cosette:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;So there is a fair going on here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, sir; it is Christmas.&rdquo;</p><p>As they approached the tavern, Cosette timidly touched his arm:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, my child?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We are quite near the house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you let me take my bucket now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If Madame sees that some one has carried it for me, she will beat me.&rdquo;</p><p>The man handed her the bucket.

Thedoor opened. The Thénardier appeared with a candle in her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! so it&rsquo;s you, you little wretch! good mercy, but you&rsquo;ve taken yourtime! The hussy has been amusing herself!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Cosette, trembling all over, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a gentleman who wantsa lodging.&rdquo;</p><p>The Thénardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace, achange of aspect common to tavern-keepers, and eagerly sought thenewcomer with her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the gentleman?&rdquo; said she.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Madame,&rdquo; replied the man, raising his hand to his hat.</p><p>Wealthy travellers are not so polite. This gesture, and an inspection ofthe stranger&rsquo;s costume and baggage, which the Thénardier passed in reviewwith one glance, caused the amiable grimace to vanish, and the gruff miento reappear. She resumed dryly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Enter, my good man.&rdquo;</p><p>The &ldquo;good man&rdquo; entered. The Thénardier cast a second glance at him, paidparticular attention to his frock-coat, which was absolutely threadbare,and to his hat, which was a little battered, and, tossing her head,wrinkling her nose, and screwing up her eyes, she consulted her husband,who was still drinking with the carters. The husband replied by thatimperceptible movement of the forefinger, which, backed up by an inflationof the lips, signifies in such cases: A regular beggar. Thereupon, theThénardier exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! see here, my good man; I am very sorry, but I have no room left.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Put me where you like,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;in the attic, in the stable. Iwill pay as though I occupied a room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Forty sous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Forty sous; agreed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very well, then!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Forty sous!&rdquo; said a carter, in a low tone, to the Thénardier woman; &ldquo;why,the charge is only twenty sous!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is forty in his case,&rdquo; retorted the Thénardier, in the same tone. &ldquo;Idon&rsquo;t lodge poor folks for less.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; added her husband, gently; &ldquo;it ruins a house to have suchpeople in it.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, the man, laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench, hadseated himself at a table, on which Cosette made haste to place a bottleof wine and a glass. The merchant who had demanded the bucket of watertook it to his horse himself. Cosette resumed her place under the kitchentable, and her knitting.</p><p>The man, who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had pouredout for himself, observed the child with peculiar attention.</p><p>Cosette was ugly. If she had been happy, she might have been pretty. Wehave already given a sketch of that sombre little figure. Cosette was thinand pale; she was nearly eight years old, but she seemed to be hardly six.Her large eyes, sunken in a sort of shadow, were almost put out withweeping. The corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish whichis seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people. Her hands were,as her mother had divined, &ldquo;ruined with chilblains.&rdquo; The fire whichilluminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of herbones, and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent. As she was alwaysshivering, she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees one againstthe other. Her entire clothing was but a rag which would have inspiredpity in summer, and which inspired horror in winter. All she had on washole-ridden linen, not a scrap of woollen. Her skin was visible here andthere and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried, which markedthe places where the Thénardier woman had touched her. Her naked legs werethin and red. The hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep. Thischild&rsquo;s whole person, her mien, her attitude, the sound of her voice, theintervals which she allowed to elapse between one word and the next, herglance, her silence, her slightest gesture, expressed and betrayed onesole idea,&mdash;fear.</p><p>Fear was diffused all over her; she was covered with it, so to speak; feardrew her elbows close to her hips, withdrew her heels under her petticoat,made her occupy as little space as possible, allowed her only the breaththat was absolutely necessary, and had become what might be called thehabit of her body, admitting of no possible variation except an increase.In the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook where terrorlurked.</p><p>Her fear was such, that on her arrival, wet as she was, Cosette did notdare to approach the fire and dry herself, but sat silently down to herwork again.</p><p>The expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habituallyso gloomy, and at times so tragic, that it seemed at certain moments asthough she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon.</p><p>As we have stated, she had never known what it is to pray; she had neverset foot in a church. &ldquo;Have I the time?&rdquo; said the Thénardier.</p><p>The man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from Cosette.</p><p>All at once, the Thénardier exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;By the way, where&rsquo;s that bread?&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette, according to her custom whenever the Thénardier uplifted hervoice, emerged with great haste from beneath the table.</p><p>She had completely forgotten the bread. She had recourse to the expedientof children who live in a constant state of fear. She lied.</p><p>&ldquo;Madame, the baker&rsquo;s shop was shut.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You should have knocked.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did knock, Madame.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He did not open the door.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find out to-morrow whether that is true,&rdquo; said the Thénardier; &ldquo;andif you are telling me a lie, I&rsquo;ll lead you a pretty dance. In themeantime, give me back my fifteen-sou piece.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron, and turned green.The fifteen-sou piece was not there.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, come now,&rdquo; said Madame Thénardier, &ldquo;did you hear me?&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette turned her pocket inside out; there was nothing in it. What couldhave become of that money? The unhappy little creature could not find aword to say. She was petrified.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you lost that fifteen-sou piece?&rdquo; screamed the Thénardier, hoarsely,&ldquo;or do you want to rob me of it?&rdquo;</p><p>At the same time, she stretched out her arm towards the cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tailswhich hung on a nail in the chimney-corner.</p><p>This formidable gesture restored to Cosette sufficient strength to shriek:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Mercy, Madame, Madame! I will not do so any more!&rdquo;</p><p>The Thénardier took down the whip.</p><p>In the meantime, the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fobof his waistcoat, without any one having noticed his movements. Besides,the other travellers were drinking or playing cards, and were not payingattention to anything.</p><p>Cosette contracted herself into a ball, with anguish, within the angle ofthe chimney, endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half-nudelimbs. The Thénardier raised her arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Madame,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;but just now I caught sight ofsomething which had fallen from this little one&rsquo;s apron pocket, and rolledaside. Perhaps this is it.&rdquo;</p><p>At the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor fora moment.</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly; here it is,&rdquo; he went on, straightening himself up.</p><p>And he held out a silver coin to the Thénardier.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said she.</p><p>It was not it, for it was a twenty-sou piece; but the Thénardier found itto her advantage. She put the coin in her pocket, and confined herself tocasting a fierce glance at the child, accompanied with the remark, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;tlet this ever happen again!&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette returned to what the Thénardier called &ldquo;her kennel,&rdquo; and her largeeyes, which were riveted on the traveller, began to take on an expressionsuch as they had never worn before. Thus far it was only an innocentamazement, but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with it.</p><p>&ldquo;By the way, would you like some supper?&rdquo; the Thénardier inquired of thetraveller.</p><p>He made no reply. He appeared to be absorbed in thought.</p><p>&ldquo;What sort of a man is that?&rdquo; she muttered between her teeth. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s somefrightfully poor wretch. He hasn&rsquo;t a sou to pay for a supper. Will he evenpay me for his lodging? It&rsquo;s very lucky, all the same, that it did notoccur to him to steal the money that was on the floor.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, a door had opened, and Éponine and Azelma entered.</p><p>They were two really pretty little girls, more bourgeois than peasant inlooks, and very charming; the one with shining chestnut tresses, the otherwith long black braids hanging down her back, both vivacious, neat, plump,rosy, and healthy, and a delight to the eye. They were warmly clad, butwith so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detractfrom the coquetry of arrangement. There was a hint of winter, though thespringtime was not wholly effaced. Light emanated from these two littlebeings. Besides this, they were on the throne. In their toilettes, intheir gayety, in the noise which they made, there was sovereignty. Whenthey entered, the Thénardier said to them in a grumbling tone which wasfull of adoration, &ldquo;Ah! there you are, you children!&rdquo;</p><p>Then drawing them, one after the other to her knees, smoothing their hair,tying their ribbons afresh, and then releasing them with that gentlemanner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Whatfrights they are!&rdquo;</p><p>They went and seated themselves in the chimney-corner. They had a doll,which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyouschatter. From time to time Cosette raised her eyes from her knitting, andwatched their play with a melancholy air.</p><p>Éponine and Azelma did not look at Cosette. She was the same as a dog tothem. These three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty yearsbetween them, but they already represented the whole society of man; envyon the one side, disdain on the other.</p><p>The doll of the Thénardier sisters was very much faded, very old, and muchbroken; but it seemed nonetheless admirable to Cosette, who had neverhad a doll in her life, <i>a real doll</i>, to make use of the expressionwhich all children will understand.</p><p>All at once, the Thénardier, who had been going back and forth in theroom, perceived that Cosette&rsquo;s mind was distracted, and that, instead ofworking, she was paying attention to the little ones at their play.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! I&rsquo;ve caught you at it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the way you work! I&rsquo;llmake you work to the tune of the whip; that I will.&rdquo;</p><p>The stranger turned to the Thénardier, without quitting his chair.</p><p>&ldquo;Bah, Madame,&rdquo; he said, with an almost timid air, &ldquo;let her play!&rdquo;</p><p>Such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton andhad drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper, and who had not theair of being frightfully poor, would have been equivalent to an order. Butthat a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire, and that aman with such a coat should permit himself to have a will, was somethingwhich Madame Thénardier did not intend to tolerate. She retorted withacrimony:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;She must work, since she eats. I don&rsquo;t feed her to do nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is she making?&rdquo; went on the stranger, in a gentle voice whichcontrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter&rsquo;sshoulders.</p><p>The Thénardier deigned to reply:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Stockings, if you please. Stockings for my little girls, who have none,so to speak, and who are absolutely barefoot just now.&rdquo;</p><p>The man looked at Cosette&rsquo;s poor little red feet, and continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;When will she have finished this pair of stockings?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She has at least three or four good days&rsquo; work on them still, the lazycreature!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finishedthem?&rdquo;</p><p>The Thénardier cast a glance of disdain on him.</p><p>&ldquo;Thirty sous at least.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you sell them for five francs?&rdquo; went on the man.</p><p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed a carter who was listening, with a loud laugh;&ldquo;five francs! the deuce, I should think so! five balls!&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier thought it time to strike in.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; if such is your fancy, you will be allowed to have that pair ofstockings for five francs. We can refuse nothing to travellers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must pay on the spot,&rdquo; said the Thénardier, in her curt andperemptory fashion.</p><p>&ldquo;I will buy that pair of stockings,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;and,&rdquo; he added,drawing a five-franc piece from his pocket, and laying it on the table, &ldquo;Iwill pay for them.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he turned to Cosette.</p><p>&ldquo;Now I own your work; play, my child.&rdquo;</p><p>The carter was so much touched by the five-franc piece, that he abandonedhis glass and hastened up.</p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; he cried, examining it. &ldquo;A real hind wheel! and notcounterfeit!&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket.</p><p>The Thénardier had no reply to make. She bit her lips, and her faceassumed an expression of hatred.</p><p>In the meantime, Cosette was trembling. She ventured to ask:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it true, Madame? May I play?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Play!&rdquo; said the Thénardier, in a terrible voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Madame,&rdquo; said Cosette.</p><p>And while her mouth thanked the Thénardier, her whole little soul thankedthe traveller.</p><p>Thénardier had resumed his drinking; his wife whispered in his ear:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Who can this yellow man be?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have seen millionaires with coats like that,&rdquo; replied Thénardier, in asovereign manner.</p><p>Cosette had dropped her knitting, but had not left her seat. Cosettealways moved as little as possible. She picked up some old rags and herlittle lead sword from a box behind her.</p><p>Éponine and Azelma paid no attention to what was going on. They had justexecuted a very important operation; they had just got hold of the cat.They had thrown their doll on the ground, and Éponine, who was the elder,was swathing the little cat, in spite of its mewing and its contortions,in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps. While performing thisserious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet andadorable language of children, whose grace, like the splendor of thebutterfly&rsquo;s wing, vanishes when one essays to fix it fast.</p><p>&ldquo;You see, sister, this doll is more amusing than the other. She twists,she cries, she is warm. See, sister, let us play with her. She shall be mylittle girl. I will be a lady. I will come to see you, and you shall lookat her. Gradually, you will perceive her whiskers, and that will surpriseyou. And then you will see her ears, and then you will see her tail and itwill amaze you. And you will say to me, &lsquo;Ah! Mon Dieu!&rsquo; and I will say toyou: &lsquo;Yes, Madame, it is my little girl. Little girls are made like thatjust at present.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Azelma listened admiringly to Éponine.</p><p>In the meantime, the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song, and tolaugh at it until the ceiling shook. Thénardier accompanied and encouragedthem.</p><p>As birds make nests out of everything, so children make a doll out ofanything which comes to hand. While Éponine and Azelma were bundling upthe cat, Cosette, on her side, had dressed up her sword. That done, shelaid it in her arms, and sang to it softly, to lull it to sleep.</p><p>The doll is one of the most imperious needs and, at the same time, one ofthe most charming instincts of feminine childhood. To care for, to clothe,to deck, to dress, to undress, to redress, to teach, scold a little, torock, to dandle, to lull to sleep, to imagine that something is some one,&mdash;thereinlies the whole woman&rsquo;s future. While dreaming and chattering, making tinyoutfits, and baby clothes, while sewing little gowns, and corsages andbodices, the child grows into a young girl, the young girl into a biggirl, the big girl into a woman. The first child is the continuation ofthe last doll.</p><p>A little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy, and quite asimpossible, as a woman without children.</p><p>So Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword.</p><p>Madame Thénardier approached <i>the yellow man</i>; &ldquo;My husband is right,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;perhaps it is M. Laffitte; there are such queer rich men!&rdquo;</p><p>She came and set her elbows on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said she. At this word, <i>Monsieur</i>, the man turned; up tothat time, the Thénardier had addressed him only as <i>brave homme</i> or<i>bonhomme</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; she pursued, assuming a sweetish air that was even morerepulsive to behold than her fierce mien, &ldquo;I am willing that the childshould play; I do not oppose it, but it is good for once, because you aregenerous. You see, she has nothing; she must needs work.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then this child is not yours?&rdquo; demanded the man.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! mon Dieu! no, sir! she is a little beggar whom we have taken inthrough charity; a sort of imbecile child. She must have water on thebrain; she has a large head, as you see. We do what we can for her, for weare not rich; we have written in vain to her native place, and havereceived no reply these six months. It must be that her mother is dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the man, and fell into his reverie once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Her mother didn&rsquo;t amount to much,&rdquo; added the Thénardier; &ldquo;she abandonedher child.&rdquo;</p><p>During the whole of this conversation Cosette, as though warned by someinstinct that she was under discussion, had not taken her eyes from theThénardier&rsquo;s face; she listened vaguely; she caught a few words here andthere.</p><p>Meanwhile, the drinkers, all three-quarters intoxicated, were repeatingtheir unclean refrain with redoubled gayety; it was a highly spiced andwanton song, in which the Virgin and the infant Jesus were introduced. TheThénardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter. Cosette, fromher post under the table, gazed at the fire, which was reflected from herfixed eyes. She had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made,and, as she rocked it, she sang in a low voice, &ldquo;My mother is dead! mymother is dead! my mother is dead!&rdquo;</p><p>On being urged afresh by the hostess, the yellow man, &ldquo;the millionaire,&rdquo; consented at last to take supper.</p><p>&ldquo;What does Monsieur wish?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bread and cheese,&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>&ldquo;Decidedly, he is a beggar&rdquo; thought Madame Thénardier.</p><p>The drunken men were still singing their song, and the child under thetable was singing hers.</p><p>All at once, Cosette paused; she had just turned round and caught sight ofthe little Thénardiers&rsquo; doll, which they had abandoned for the cat and hadleft on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table.</p><p>Then she dropped the swaddled sword, which only half met her needs, andcast her eyes slowly round the room. Madame Thénardier was whispering toher husband and counting over some money; Ponine and Zelma were playingwith the cat; the travellers were eating or drinking or singing; not aglance was fixed on her. She had not a moment to lose; she crept out fromunder the table on her hands and knees, made sure once more that no onewas watching her; then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it.An instant later she was in her place again, seated motionless, and onlyturned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms. Thehappiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it contained allthe violence of voluptuousness.</p><p>No one had seen her, except the traveller, who was slowly devouring hismeagre supper.</p><p>This joy lasted about a quarter of an hour.</p><p>But with all the precautions that Cosette had taken she did not perceivethat one of the doll&rsquo;s legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearthlighted it up very vividly. That pink and shining foot, projecting fromthe shadow, suddenly struck the eye of Azelma, who said to Éponine, &ldquo;Look!sister.&rdquo;</p><p>The two little girls paused in stupefaction; Cosette had dared to taketheir doll!</p><p>Éponine rose, and, without releasing the cat, she ran to her mother, andbegan to tug at her skirt.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo; said her mother; &ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;look there!&rdquo;</p><p>And she pointed to Cosette.</p><p>Cosette, absorbed in the ecstasies of possession, no longer saw or heardanything.</p><p>Madame Thénardier&rsquo;s countenance assumed that peculiar expression which iscomposed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life, and which hascaused this style of woman to be named <i>Megaeras</i>.</p><p>On this occasion, wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further.Cosette had overstepped all bounds; Cosette had laid violent hands on thedoll belonging to &ldquo;these young ladies.&rdquo; A czarina who should see a muzhiktrying on her imperial son&rsquo;s blue ribbon would wear no other face.</p><p>She shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette!&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her; she turnedround.</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette!&rdquo; repeated the Thénardier.</p><p>Cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort ofveneration, mingled with despair; then, without taking her eyes from it,she clasped her hands, and, what is terrible to relate of a child of thatage, she wrung them; then&mdash;not one of the emotions of the day,neither the trip to the forest, nor the weight of the bucket of water, northe loss of the money, nor the sight of the whip, nor even the sad wordswhich she had heard Madame Thénardier utter had been able to wring thisfrom her&mdash;she wept; she burst out sobbing.</p><p>Meanwhile, the traveller had risen to his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he said to the Thénardier.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; said the Thénardier, pointing to the <i>corpus delicti</i>which lay at Cosette&rsquo;s feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; resumed the man.</p><p>&ldquo;That beggar,&rdquo; replied the Thénardier, &ldquo;has permitted herself to touch thechildren&rsquo;s doll!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All this noise for that!&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;well, what if she did play withthat doll?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She touched it with her dirty hands!&rdquo; pursued the Thénardier, &ldquo;with herfrightful hands!&rdquo;</p><p>Here Cosette redoubled her sobs.</p><p>&ldquo;Will you stop your noise?&rdquo; screamed the Thénardier.</p><p>The man went straight to the street door, opened it, and stepped out.</p><p>As soon as he had gone, the Thénardier profited by his absence to giveCosette a hearty kick under the table, which made the child utter loudcries.</p><p>The door opened again, the man reappeared; he carried in both hands thefabulous doll which we have mentioned, and which all the village brats hadbeen staring at ever since the morning, and he set it upright in front ofCosette, saying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Here; this is for you.&rdquo;</p><p>It must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he hadspent there he had taken confused notice through his reverie of that toyshop, lighted up by fire-pots and candles so splendidly that it wasvisible like an illumination through the window of the drinking-shop.</p><p>Cosette raised her eyes; she gazed at the man approaching her with thatdoll as she might have gazed at the sun; she heard the unprecedentedwords, &ldquo;It is for you&rdquo;; she stared at him; she stared at the doll; thenshe slowly retreated, and hid herself at the extreme end, under the tablein a corner of the wall.</p><p>She no longer cried; she no longer wept; she had the appearance of nolonger daring to breathe.</p><p>The Thénardier, Éponine, and Azelma were like statues also; the verydrinkers had paused; a solemn silence reigned through the whole room.</p><p>Madame Thénardier, petrified and mute, recommenced her conjectures: &ldquo;Whois that old fellow? Is he a poor man? Is he a millionaire? Perhaps he isboth; that is to say, a thief.&rdquo;</p><p>The face of the male Thénardier presented that expressive fold whichaccentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appearsthere in all its bestial force. The tavern-keeper stared alternately atthe doll and at the traveller; he seemed to be scenting out the man, as hewould have scented out a bag of money. This did not last longer than thespace of a flash of lightning. He stepped up to his wife and said to herin a low voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That machine costs at least thirty francs. No nonsense. Down on yourbelly before that man!&rdquo;</p><p>Gross natures have this in common with <i>naïve</i> natures, that theypossess no transition state.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Cosette,&rdquo; said the Thénardier, in a voice that strove to be sweet,and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t yougoing to take your doll?&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette ventured to emerge from her hole.</p><p>&ldquo;The gentleman has given you a doll, my little Cosette,&rdquo; said Thénardier,with a caressing air. &ldquo;Take it; it is yours.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror. Her face wasstill flooded with tears, but her eyes began to fill, like the sky atdaybreak, with strange beams of joy. What she felt at that moment was alittle like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told,&ldquo;Little one, you are the Queen of France.&rdquo;</p><p>It seemed to her that if she touched that doll, lightning would dart fromit.</p><p>This was true, up to a certain point, for she said to herself that theThénardier would scold and beat her.</p><p>Nevertheless, the attraction carried the day. She ended by drawing nearand murmuring timidly as she turned towards Madame Thénardier:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;May I, Madame?&rdquo;</p><p>No words can render that air, at once despairing, terrified, and ecstatic.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardi!&rdquo; cried the Thénardier, &ldquo;it is yours. The gentleman has given it toyou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Truly, sir?&rdquo; said Cosette. &ldquo;Is it true? Is the &lsquo;lady&rsquo; mine?&rdquo;</p><p>The stranger&rsquo;s eyes seemed to be full of tears. He appeared to havereached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest heshould weep. He nodded to Cosette, and placed the &ldquo;lady&rsquo;s&rdquo; hand in hertiny hand.</p><p>Cosette hastily withdrew her hand, as though that of the &ldquo;lady&rdquo; scorchedher, and began to stare at the floor. We are forced to add that at thatmoment she stuck out her tongue immoderately. All at once she wheeledround and seized the doll in a transport.</p><p>&ldquo;I shall call her Catherine,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>It was an odd moment when Cosette&rsquo;s rags met and clasped the ribbons andfresh pink muslins of the doll.</p><p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;may I put her on a chair?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my child,&rdquo; replied the Thénardier.</p><p>It was now the turn of Éponine and Azelma to gaze at Cosette with envy.</p><p>Cosette placed Catherine on a chair, then seated herself on the floor infront of her, and remained motionless, without uttering a word, in anattitude of contemplation.</p><p>&ldquo;Play, Cosette,&rdquo; said the stranger.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! I am playing,&rdquo; returned the child.</p><p>This stranger, this unknown individual, who had the air of a visit whichProvidence was making on Cosette, was the person whom the Thénardier hatedworse than any one in the world at that moment. However, it was necessaryto control herself. Habituated as she was to dissimulation throughendeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions, these emotions weremore than she could endure. She made haste to send her daughters to bed,then she asked the man&rsquo;s <i>permission</i> to send Cosette off also; &ldquo;forshe has worked hard all day,&rdquo; she added with a maternal air. Cosette wentoff to bed, carrying Catherine in her arms.</p><p>From time to time the Thénardier went to the other end of the room whereher husband was, to <i>relieve her soul</i>, as she said. She exchangedwith her husband words which were all the more furious because she darednot utter them aloud.</p><p>&ldquo;Old beast! What has he got in his belly, to come and upset us in thismanner! To want that little monster to play! to give away forty-francdolls to a jade that I would sell for forty sous, so I would! A littlemore and he will be saying <i>Your Majesty</i> to her, as though to theDuchesse de Berry! Is there any sense in it? Is he mad, then, thatmysterious old fellow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why! it is perfectly simple,&rdquo; replied Thénardier, &ldquo;if that amuses him! Itamuses you to have the little one work; it amuses him to have her play.He&rsquo;s all right. A traveller can do what he pleases when he pays for it. Ifthe old fellow is a philanthropist, what is that to you? If he is animbecile, it does not concern you. What are you worrying for, so long ashe has money?&rdquo;</p><p>The language of a master, and the reasoning of an innkeeper, neither ofwhich admitted of any reply.</p><p>The man had placed his elbows on the table, and resumed his thoughtfulattitude. All the other travellers, both pedlers and carters, hadwithdrawn a little, and had ceased singing. They were staring at him froma distance, with a sort of respectful awe. This poorly dressed man, whodrew &ldquo;hind-wheels&rdquo; from his pocket with so much ease, and who lavishedgigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes, was certainly amagnificent fellow, and one to be feared.</p><p>Many hours passed. The midnight mass was over, the chimes had ceased, thedrinkers had taken their departure, the drinking-shop was closed, thepublic room was deserted, the fire extinct, the stranger still remained inthe same place and the same attitude. From time to time he changed theelbow on which he leaned. That was all; but he had not said a word sinceCosette had left the room.</p><p>The Thénardiers alone, out of politeness and curiosity, had remained inthe room.</p><p>&ldquo;Is he going to pass the night in that fashion?&rdquo; grumbled the Thénardier.When two o&rsquo;clock in the morning struck, she declared herself vanquished,and said to her husband, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed. Do as you like.&rdquo; Her husbandseated himself at a table in the corner, lighted a candle, and began toread the <i>Courrier Français</i>.</p><p>A good hour passed thus. The worthy inn-keeper had perused the <i>CourrierFrançais</i> at least three times, from the date of the number to theprinter&rsquo;s name. The stranger did not stir.</p><p>Thénardier fidgeted, coughed, spit, blew his nose, and creaked his chair.Not a movement on the man&rsquo;s part. &ldquo;Is he asleep?&rdquo; thought Thénardier. Theman was not asleep, but nothing could arouse him.</p><p>At last Thénardier took off his cap, stepped gently up to him, andventured to say:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is not Monsieur going to his repose?&rdquo;</p><p><i>Not going to bed</i> would have seemed to him excessive and familiar.<i>To repose</i> smacked of luxury and respect. These words possess themysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the followingday. A chamber where one <i>sleeps</i> costs twenty sous; a chamber inwhich one <i>reposes</i> costs twenty francs.</p><p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;you are right. Where is your stable?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Thénardier, with a smile, &ldquo;I will conduct you, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>He took the candle; the man picked up his bundle and cudgel, andThénardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor, which was ofrare splendor, all furnished in mahogany, with a low bedstead, curtainedwith red calico.</p><p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; said the traveller.</p><p>&ldquo;It is really our bridal chamber,&rdquo; said the tavern-keeper. &ldquo;My wife and Ioccupy another. This is only entered three or four times a year.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should have liked the stable quite as well,&rdquo; said the man, abruptly.</p><p>Thénardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark.</p><p>He lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on thechimney-piece. A very good fire was flickering on the hearth.</p><p>On the chimney-piece, under a glass globe, stood a woman&rsquo;s head-dress insilver wire and orange flowers.</p><p>&ldquo;And what is this?&rdquo; resumed the stranger.</p><p>&ldquo;That, sir,&rdquo; said Thénardier, &ldquo;is my wife&rsquo;s wedding bonnet.&rdquo;</p><p>The traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say,&ldquo;There really was a time, then, when that monster was a maiden?&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier lied, however. When he had leased this paltry building for thepurpose of converting it into a tavern, he had found this chamberdecorated in just this manner, and had purchased the furniture andobtained the orange flowers at second hand, with the idea that this wouldcast a graceful shadow on &ldquo;his spouse,&rdquo; and would result in what theEnglish call respectability for his house.</p><p>When the traveller turned round, the host had disappeared. Thénardier hadwithdrawn discreetly, without venturing to wish him a good night, as hedid not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposedto fleece royally the following morning.</p><p>The inn-keeper retired to his room. His wife was in bed, but she was notasleep. When she heard her husband&rsquo;s step she turned over and said to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know, I&rsquo;m going to turn Cosette out of doors to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier replied coldly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;How you do go on!&rdquo;</p><p>They exchanged no further words, and a few moments later their candle wasextinguished.</p><p>As for the traveller, he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in acorner. The landlord once gone, he threw himself into an armchair andremained for some time buried in thought. Then he removed his shoes, tookone of the two candles, blew out the other, opened the door, and quittedthe room, gazing about him like a person who is in search of something. Hetraversed a corridor and came upon a staircase. There he heard a veryfaint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child. He followed thissound, and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase,or rather formed by the staircase itself. This recess was nothing elsethan the space under the steps. There, in the midst of all sorts of oldpapers and potsherds, among dust and spiders&rsquo; webs, was a bed&mdash;if onecan call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes as to displaythe straw, and a coverlet so tattered as to show the pallet. No sheets.This was placed on the floor.</p><p>In this bed Cosette was sleeping.</p><p>The man approached and gazed down upon her.</p><p>Cosette was in a profound sleep; she was fully dressed. In the winter shedid not undress, in order that she might not be so cold.</p><p>Against her breast was pressed the doll, whose large eyes, wide open,glittered in the dark. From time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh asthough she were on the point of waking, and she strained the doll almostconvulsively in her arms. Beside her bed there was only one of her woodenshoes.</p><p>A door which stood open near Cosette&rsquo;s pallet permitted a view of a ratherlarge, dark room. The stranger stepped into it. At the further extremity,through a glass door, he saw two small, very white beds. They belonged toÉponine and Azelma. Behind these beds, and half hidden, stood anuncurtained wicker cradle, in which the little boy who had cried all theevening lay asleep.</p><p>The stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of theThénardier pair. He was on the point of retreating when his eye fell uponthe fireplace&mdash;one of those vast tavern chimneys where there isalways so little fire when there is any fire at all, and which are so coldto look at. There was no fire in this one, there was not even ashes; butthere was something which attracted the stranger&rsquo;s gaze, nevertheless. Itwas two tiny children&rsquo;s shoes, coquettish in shape and unequal in size.The traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in accordancewith which children place their shoes in the chimney on Christmas eve,there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy.Éponine and Azelma had taken care not to omit this, and each of them hadset one of her shoes on the hearth.</p><p>The traveller bent over them.</p><p>The fairy, that is to say, their mother, had already paid her visit, andin each he saw a brand-new and shining ten-sou piece.</p><p>The man straightened himself up, and was on the point of withdrawing, whenfar in, in the darkest corner of the hearth, he caught sight of anotherobject. He looked at it, and recognized a wooden shoe, a frightful shoe ofthe coarsest description, half dilapidated and all covered with ashes anddried mud. It was Cosette&rsquo;s sabot. Cosette, with that touching trust ofchildhood, which can always be deceived yet never discouraged, had placedher shoe on the hearth-stone also.</p><p>Hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet andtouching thing.</p><p>There was nothing in this wooden shoe.</p><p>The stranger fumbled in his waistcoat, bent over and placed a louis d&rsquo;orin Cosette&rsquo;s shoe.</p><p>Then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0101" id="link2HCH0101"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash; THÉNARDIER AND HIS MANŒUVRES</h3><p>On the following morning, two hours at least before day-break, Thénardier,seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern, pen in hand, wasmaking out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat.</p><p>His wife, standing beside him, and half bent over him, was following himwith her eyes. They exchanged not a word. On the one hand, there wasprofound meditation, on the other, the religious admiration with which onewatches the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind. A noisewas audible in the house; it was the Lark sweeping the stairs.</p><p>After the lapse of a good quarter of an hour, and some erasures,Thénardier produced the following masterpiece:&mdash;</p><p class="center">BILL OF THE GENTLEMAN IN No. 1.</p><table summary="" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"><tr><td>Supper</td><td>3 francs.</td></tr><tr><td>Chamber</td><td>10    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Candle</td><td>5    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Fire</td><td>4    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td>Service</td><td>1    &rdquo;</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>23 francs.</td></tr></table><p>Service was written <i>servisse</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty-three francs!&rdquo; cried the woman, with an enthusiasm which wasmingled with some hesitation.</p><p>Like all great artists, Thénardier was dissatisfied.</p><p>&ldquo;Peuh!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p><p>It was the accent of Castlereagh auditing France&rsquo;s bill at the Congress ofVienna.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Thénardier, you are right; he certainly owes that,&rdquo; murmured thewife, who was thinking of the doll bestowed on Cosette in the presence ofher daughters. &ldquo;It is just, but it is too much. He will not pay it.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier laughed coldly, as usual, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;He will pay.&rdquo;</p><p>This laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority. Thatwhich was asserted in this manner must needs be so. His wife did notinsist.</p><p>She set about arranging the table; her husband paced the room. A momentlater he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I owe full fifteen hundred francs!&rdquo;</p><p>He went and seated himself in the chimney-corner, meditating, with hisfeet among the warm ashes.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! by the way,&rdquo; resumed his wife, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t forget that I&rsquo;m going toturn Cosette out of doors to-day? The monster! She breaks my heart withthat doll of hers! I&rsquo;d rather marry Louis XVIII. than keep her another dayin the house!&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier lighted his pipe, and replied between two puffs:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You will hand that bill to the man.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he went out.</p><p>Hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered.</p><p>Thénardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in thehalf-open door, visible only to his wife.</p><p>The yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Up so early?&rdquo; said Madame Thénardier; &ldquo;is Monsieur leaving us already?&rdquo;</p><p>As she spoke thus, she was twisting the bill about in her hands with anembarrassed air, and making creases in it with her nails. Her hard facepresented a shade which was not habitual with it,&mdash;timidity andscruples.</p><p>To present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air &ldquo;of a poorwretch&rdquo; seemed difficult to her.</p><p>The traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent-minded. He replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Madame, I am going.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So Monsieur has no business in Montfermeil?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I was passing through. That is all. What do I owe you, Madame,&rdquo; headded.</p><p>The Thénardier silently handed him the folded bill.</p><p>The man unfolded the paper and glanced at it; but his thoughts wereevidently elsewhere.</p><p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;is business good here in Montfermeil?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So so, Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the Thénardier, stupefied at not witnessinganother sort of explosion.</p><p>She continued, in a dreary and lamentable tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Monsieur, times are so hard! and then, we have so few bourgeois inthe neighborhood! All the people are poor, you see. If we had not, now andthen, some rich and generous travellers like Monsieur, we should not getalong at all. We have so many expenses. Just see, that child is costing usour very eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What child?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, the little one, you know!

I have no need to bring up other people&rsquo;s children.&rdquo;</p><p>The man resumed, in that voice which he strove to render indifferent, andin which there lingered a tremor:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What if one were to rid you of her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who? Cosette?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>The landlady&rsquo;s red and violent face brightened up hideously.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! sir, my dear sir, take her, keep her, lead her off, carry her away,sugar her, stuff her with truffles, drink her, eat her, and the blessingsof the good holy Virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Agreed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really! You will take her away?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will take her away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Immediately?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Immediately. Call the child.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette!&rdquo; screamed the Thénardier.</p><p>&ldquo;In the meantime,&rdquo; pursued the man, &ldquo;I will pay you what I owe you. Howmuch is it?&rdquo;</p><p>He cast a glance on the bill, and could not restrain a start of surprise:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty-three francs!&rdquo;</p><p>He looked at the landlady, and repeated:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty-three francs?&rdquo;</p><p>There was in the enunciation of these words, thus repeated, an accentbetween an exclamation and an interrogation point.</p><p>The Thénardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock. She replied,with assurance:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Good gracious, yes, sir, it is twenty-three francs.&rdquo;</p><p>The stranger laid five five-franc pieces on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Go and get the child,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>At that moment Thénardier advanced to the middle of the room, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur owes twenty-six sous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty-six sous!&rdquo; exclaimed his wife.</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty sous for the chamber,&rdquo; resumed Thénardier, coldly, &ldquo;and six sousfor his supper. As for the child, I must discuss that matter a little withthe gentleman. Leave us, wife.&rdquo;</p><p>Madame Thénardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpectedlightning flashes of talent. She was conscious that a great actor wasmaking his entrance on the stage, uttered not a word in reply, and leftthe room.</p><p>As soon as they were alone, Thénardier offered the traveller a chair. Thetraveller seated himself; Thénardier remained standing, and his faceassumed a singular expression of good-fellowship and simplicity.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what I have to say to you is this, that I adore thatchild.&rdquo;</p><p>The stranger gazed intently at him.</p><p>&ldquo;What child?&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;How strange it is, one grows attached. What money is that? Take back yourhundred-sou piece. I adore the child.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean?&rdquo; demanded the stranger.</p><p>&ldquo;Eh! our little Cosette! Are you not intending to take her away from us?Well, I speak frankly; as true as you are an honest man, I will notconsent to it. I shall miss that child. I saw her first when she was atiny thing. It is true that she costs us money; it is true that she hasher faults; it is true that we are not rich; it is true that I have paidout over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses! Butone must do something for the good God&rsquo;s sake. She has neither father normother. I have brought her up. I have bread enough for her and for myself.In truth, I think a great deal of that child. You understand, oneconceives an affection for a person; I am a good sort of a beast, I am; Ido not reason; I love that little girl; my wife is quick-tempered, but sheloves her also. You see, she is just the same as our own child. I want tokeep her to babble about the house.&rdquo;</p><p>The stranger kept his eye intently fixed on Thénardier. The lattercontinued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir, but one does not give away one&rsquo;s child to a passer-by,like that. I am right, am I not? Still, I don&rsquo;t say&mdash;you are rich;you have the air of a very good man,&mdash;if it were for her happiness.But one must find out that. You understand: suppose that I were to let hergo and to sacrifice myself, I should like to know what becomes of her; Ishould not wish to lose sight of her; I should like to know with whom sheis living, so that I could go to see her from time to time; so that shemay know that her good foster-father is alive, that he is watching overher. In short, there are things which are not possible. I do not even knowyour name. If you were to take her away, I should say: &lsquo;Well, and theLark, what has become of her?&rsquo; One must, at least, see some petty scrap ofpaper, some trifle in the way of a passport, you know!&rdquo;</p><p>The stranger, still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates, as thesaying goes, to the very depths of the conscience, replied in a grave,firm voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Thénardier, one does not require a passport to travel fiveleagues from Paris. If I take Cosette away, I shall take her away, andthat is the end of the matter. You will not know my name, you will notknow my residence, you will not know where she is; and my intention isthat she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives. I breakthe thread which binds her foot, and she departs. Does that suit you? Yesor no?&rdquo;</p><p>Since geniuses, like demons, recognize the presence of a superior God bycertain signs, Thénardier comprehended that he had to deal with a verystrong person. It was like an intuition; he comprehended it with his clearand sagacious promptitude. While drinking with the carters, smoking, andsinging coarse songs on the preceding evening, he had devoted the whole ofthe time to observing the stranger, watching him like a cat, and studyinghim like a mathematician. He had watched him, both on his own account, forthe pleasure of the thing, and through instinct, and had spied upon him asthough he had been paid for so doing. Not a movement, not a gesture, onthe part of the man in the yellow great-coat had escaped him. Even beforethe stranger had so clearly manifested his interest in Cosette, Thénardierhad divined his purpose. He had caught the old man&rsquo;s deep glancesreturning constantly to the child. Who was this man? Why this interest?Why this hideous costume, when he had so much money in his purse?Questions which he put to himself without being able to solve them, andwhich irritated him. He had pondered it all night long. He could not beCosette&rsquo;s father. Was he her grandfather? Then why not make himself knownat once? When one has a right, one asserts it. This man evidently had noright over Cosette. What was it, then? Thénardier lost himself inconjectures. He caught glimpses of everything, but he saw nothing. Be thatas it may, on entering into conversation with the man, sure that there wassome secret in the case, that the latter had some interest in remaining inthe shadow, he felt himself strong; when he perceived from the stranger&rsquo;sclear and firm retort, that this mysterious personage was mysterious in sosimple a way, he became conscious that he was weak. He had expectednothing of the sort. His conjectures were put to the rout. He rallied hisideas. He weighed everything in the space of a second. Thénardier was oneof those men who take in a situation at a glance. He decided that themoment had arrived for proceeding straightforward, and quickly at that. Hedid as great leaders do at the decisive moment, which they know that theyalone recognize; he abruptly unmasked his batteries.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am in need of fifteen hundred francs.&rdquo;</p><p>The stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather,opened it, drew out three bank-bills, which he laid on the table. Then heplaced his large thumb on the notes and said to the inn-keeper:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Go and fetch Cosette.&rdquo;</p><p>While this was taking place, what had Cosette been doing?</p><p>On waking up, Cosette had run to get her shoe. In it she had found thegold piece. It was not a Napoleon; it was one of those perfectly newtwenty-franc pieces of the Restoration, on whose effigy the littlePrussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath. Cosette was dazzled. Herdestiny began to intoxicate her. She did not know what a gold piece was;she had never seen one; she hid it quickly in her pocket, as though shehad stolen it. Still, she felt that it really was hers; she guessed whenceher gift had come, but the joy which she experienced was full of fear. Shewas happy; above all she was stupefied. Such magnificent and beautifulthings did not appear real. The doll frightened her, the gold piecefrightened her. She trembled vaguely in the presence of this magnificence.The stranger alone did not frighten her. On the contrary, he reassuredher. Ever since the preceding evening, amid all her amazement, even in hersleep, she had been thinking in her little childish mind of that man whoseemed to be so poor and so sad, and who was so rich and so kind.Everything had changed for her since she had met that good man in theforest. Cosette, less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven,had never known what it was to take refuge under a mother&rsquo;s shadow andunder a wing. For the last five years, that is to say, as far back as hermemory ran, the poor child had shivered and trembled. She had always beenexposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity; now it seemed toher she was clothed. Formerly her soul had seemed cold, now it was warm.Cosette was no longer afraid of the Thénardier. She was no longer alone;there was some one there.</p><p>She hastily set about her regular morning duties. That louis, which shehad about her, in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen-sou piece hadfallen on the night before, distracted her thoughts. She dared not touchit, but she spent five minutes in gazing at it, with her tongue hangingout, if the truth must be told. As she swept the staircase, she paused,remained standing there motionless, forgetful of her broom and of theentire universe, occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at thebottom of her pocket.</p><p>It was during one of these periods of contemplation that the Thénardierjoined her. She had gone in search of Cosette at her husband&rsquo;s orders.What was quite unprecedented, she neither struck her nor said an insultingword to her.</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette,&rdquo; she said, almost gently, &ldquo;come immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>An instant later Cosette entered the public room.</p><p>The stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it. Thisbundle contained a little woollen gown, an apron, a fustian bodice, akerchief, a petticoat, woollen stockings, shoes&mdash;a complete outfitfor a girl of seven years. All was black.</p><p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;take these, and go and dress yourself quickly.&rdquo;</p><p>Daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of Montfermeil whohad begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading alittle girl dressed in mourning, and carrying a pink doll in her arms,pass along the road to Paris. They were going in the direction of Livry.</p><p>It was our man and Cosette.</p><p>No one knew the man; as Cosette was no longer in rags, many did notrecognize her. Cosette was going away. With whom? She did not know.Whither? She knew not. All that she understood was that she was leavingthe Thénardier tavern behind her. No one had thought of bidding herfarewell, nor had she thought of taking leave of any one. She was leavingthat hated and hating house.</p><p>Poor, gentle creature, whose heart had been repressed up to that hour!</p><p>Cosette walked along gravely, with her large eyes wide open, and gazing atthe sky. She had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron. From timeto time, she bent down and glanced at it; then she looked at the good man.She felt something as though she were beside the good God.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0102" id="link2HCH0102"></a>CHAPTER X&mdash;HE WHO SEEKS TO BETTER HIMSELF MAY RENDER HIS SITUATIONWORSE</h3><p>Madame Thénardier had allowed her husband to have his own way, as was herwont. She had expected great results. When the man and Cosette had takentheir departure, Thénardier allowed a full quarter of an hour to elapse;then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred francs.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said she.</p><p>It was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she haddared to criticise one of the master&rsquo;s acts.</p><p>The blow told.</p><p>&ldquo;You are right, in sooth,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I am a fool. Give me my hat.&rdquo;</p><p>He folded up the three bank-bills, thrust them into his pocket, and ranout in all haste; but he made a mistake and turned to the right first.Some neighbors, of whom he made inquiries, put him on the track again; theLark and the man had been seen going in the direction of Livry. Hefollowed these hints, walking with great strides, and talking to himselfthe while:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That man is evidently a million dressed in yellow, and I am an animal.First he gave twenty sous, then five francs, then fifty francs, thenfifteen hundred francs, all with equal readiness. He would have givenfifteen thousand francs. But I shall overtake him.&rdquo;</p><p>And then, that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child; allthat was singular; many mysteries lay concealed under it. One does not letmysteries out of one&rsquo;s hand when one has once grasped them. The secrets ofthe wealthy are sponges of gold; one must know how to subject them topressure. All these thoughts whirled through his brain. &ldquo;I am an animal,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>When one leaves Montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes thatruns to Livry, it can be seen stretching out before one to a greatdistance across the plateau. On arriving there, he calculated that heought to be able to see the old man and the child. He looked as far as hisvision reached, and saw nothing. He made fresh inquiries, but he hadwasted time. Some passers-by informed him that the man and child of whomhe was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of Gagny. Hehastened in that direction.</p><p>They were far in advance of him; but a child walks slowly, and he walkedfast; and then, he was well acquainted with the country.</p><p>All at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a manwho has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace hissteps.</p><p>&ldquo;I ought to have taken my gun,&rdquo; said he to himself.</p><p>Thénardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass throughour midst without our being aware of the fact, and who disappear withoutour finding them out, because destiny has only exhibited one side of them.It is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged. In a calm and evensituation, Thénardier possessed all that is required to make&mdash;we willnot say to be&mdash;what people have agreed to call an honest trader, agood bourgeois. At the same time certain circumstances being given,certain shocks arriving to bring his under-nature to the surface, he hadall the requisites for a blackguard. He was a shopkeeper in whom there wassome taint of the monster. Satan must have occasionally crouched down insome corner of the hovel in which Thénardier dwelt, and have fallena-dreaming in the presence of this hideous masterpiece.</p><p>After a momentary hesitation:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;they will have time to make their escape.&rdquo;</p><p>And he pursued his road, walking rapidly straight ahead, and with almostan air of certainty, with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey ofpartridges.</p><p>In truth, when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an obliquedirection the large clearing which lies on the right of the Avenue deBellevue, and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit ofthe hill, and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the Abbey ofChelles, he caught sight, over the top of the brushwood, of the hat onwhich he had already erected so many conjectures; it was that man&rsquo;s hat.The brushwood was not high. Thénardier recognized the fact that the manand Cosette were sitting there. The child could not be seen on account ofher small size, but the head of her doll was visible.</p><p>Thénardier was not mistaken. The man was sitting there, and lettingCosette get somewhat rested. The inn-keeper walked round the brushwood andpresented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in search of.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon, excuse me, sir,&rdquo; he said, quite breathless, &ldquo;but here are yourfifteen hundred francs.&rdquo;</p><p>So saying, he handed the stranger the three bank-bills.</p><p>The man raised his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier replied respectfully:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It means, sir, that I shall take back Cosette.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette shuddered, and pressed close to the old man.</p><p>He replied, gazing to the very bottom of Thénardier&rsquo;s eyes the while, andenunciating every syllable distinctly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You are go-ing to take back Co-sette?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I am. I will tell you; I have considered the matter. In fact, Ihave not the right to give her to you. I am an honest man, you see; thischild does not belong to me; she belongs to her mother. It was her motherwho confided her to me; I can only resign her to her mother. You will sayto me, &lsquo;But her mother is dead.&rsquo; Good; in that case I can only give thechild up to the person who shall bring me a writing, signed by her mother,to the effect that I am to hand the child over to the person thereinmentioned; that is clear.&rdquo;</p><p>The man, without making any reply, fumbled in his pocket, and Thénardierbeheld the pocket-book of bank-bills make its appearance once more.</p><p>The tavern-keeper shivered with joy.</p><p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;let us hold firm; he is going to bribe me!&rdquo;</p><p>Before opening the pocket-book, the traveller cast a glance about him: thespot was absolutely deserted; there was not a soul either in the woods orin the valley. The man opened his pocket-book once more and drew from it,not the handful of bills which Thénardier expected, but a simple littlepaper, which he unfolded and presented fully open to the inn-keeper,saying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You are right; read!&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier took the paper and read:&mdash;</p><p class="right">&ldquo;M. <small>SUR</small> M., March 25, 1823.</p><p class="letter">&ldquo;M<small>ONSIEUR</small> T<small>HÉNARDIER</small>:&mdash;<br/><br/>You will deliver Cosette to this person.<br/>You will be paid for all the little things.<br/>I have the honor to salute you with respect,</p><p class="right">F<small>ANTINE</small>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know that signature?&rdquo; resumed the man.</p><p>It certainly was Fantine&rsquo;s signature; Thénardier recognized it.</p><p>There was no reply to make; he experienced two violent vexations, thevexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for, and thevexation of being beaten; the man added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You may keep this paper as your receipt.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier retreated in tolerably good order.</p><p>&ldquo;This signature is fairly well imitated,&rdquo; he growled between his teeth;&ldquo;however, let it go!&rdquo;</p><p>Then he essayed a desperate effort.</p><p>&ldquo;It is well, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since you are the person, but I must be paidfor all those little things. A great deal is owing to me.&rdquo;</p><p>The man rose to his feet, filliping the dust from his threadbare sleeve:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Thénardier, in January last, the mother reckoned that she owedyou one hundred and twenty francs. In February, you sent her a bill offive hundred francs; you received three hundred francs at the end ofFebruary, and three hundred francs at the beginning of March. Since thennine months have elapsed, at fifteen francs a month, the price agreedupon, which makes one hundred and thirty-five francs. You had received onehundred francs too much; that makes thirty-five still owing you. I havejust given you fifteen hundred francs.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier&rsquo;s sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he feelshimself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is this devil of a man?&rdquo; he thought.</p><p>He did what the wolf does: he shook himself. Audacity had succeeded withhim once.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur-I-don&rsquo;t-know-your-name,&rdquo; he said resolutely, and this timecasting aside all respectful ceremony, &ldquo;I shall take back Cosette if youdo not give me a thousand crowns.&rdquo;</p><p>The stranger said tranquilly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Come, Cosette.&rdquo;</p><p>He took Cosette by his left hand, and with his right he picked up hiscudgel, which was lying on the ground.</p><p>Thénardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of thespot.</p><p>The man plunged into the forest with the child, leaving the inn-keepermotionless and speechless.</p><p>While they were walking away, Thénardier scrutinized his huge shoulders,which were a little rounded, and his great fists.</p><p>Then, bringing his eyes back to his own person, they fell upon his feeblearms and his thin hands. &ldquo;I really must have been exceedingly stupid notto have thought to bring my gun,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;since I was goinghunting!&rdquo;</p><p>However, the inn-keeper did not give up.</p><p>&ldquo;I want to know where he is going,&rdquo; said he, and he set out to follow themat a distance. Two things were left on his hands, an irony in the shape ofthe paper signed <i>Fantine</i>, and a consolation, the fifteen hundredfrancs.</p><p>The man led Cosette off in the direction of Livry and Bondy. He walkedslowly, with drooping head, in an attitude of reflection and sadness. Thewinter had thinned out the forest, so that Thénardier did not lose themfrom sight, although he kept at a good distance. The man turned round fromtime to time, and looked to see if he was being followed. All at once hecaught sight of Thénardier. He plunged suddenly into the brushwood withCosette, where they could both hide themselves. &ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo; saidThénardier, and he redoubled his pace.</p><p>The thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them. Whenthe man had reached the densest part of the thicket, he wheeled round. Itwas in vain that Thénardier sought to conceal himself in the branches; hecould not prevent the man seeing him. The man cast upon him an uneasyglance, then elevated his head and continued his course. The inn-keeperset out again in pursuit. Thus they continued for two or three hundredpaces. All at once the man turned round once more; he saw the inn-keeper.This time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that Thénardier decidedthat it was &ldquo;useless&rdquo; to proceed further. Thénardier retraced his steps.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0103" id="link2HCH0103"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;NUMBER 9,430 REAPPEARS, AND COSETTE WINS IT IN THELOTTERY</h3><p>Jean Valjean was not dead.</p><p>When he fell into the sea, or rather, when he threw himself into it, hewas not ironed, as we have seen. He swam under water until he reached avessel at anchor, to which a boat was moored. He found means of hidinghimself in this boat until night. At night he swam off again, and reachedthe shore a little way from Cape Brun. There, as he did not lack money, heprocured clothing. A small country-house in the neighborhood of Balaguierwas at that time the dressing-room of escaped convicts,&mdash;a lucrativespecialty. Then Jean Valjean, like all the sorry fugitives who are seekingto evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality, pursued an obscureand undulating itinerary. He found his first refuge at Pradeaux, nearBeausset. Then he directed his course towards Grand-Villard, nearBriançon, in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a fumbling and uneasy flight,&mdash;amole&rsquo;s track, whose branchings are untraceable. Later on, some trace ofhis passage into Ain, in the territory of Civrieux, was discovered; in thePyrenees, at Accons; at the spot called Grange-de-Doumec, near the marketof Chavailles, and in the environs of Perigueux at Brunies, canton of LaChapelle-Gonaguet. He reached Paris. We have just seen him at Montfermeil.</p><p>His first care on arriving in Paris had been to buy mourning clothes for alittle girl of from seven to eight years of age; then to procure alodging. That done, he had betaken himself to Montfermeil. It will beremembered that already, during his preceding escape, he had made amysterious trip thither, or somewhere in that neighborhood, of which thelaw had gathered an inkling.</p><p>However, he was thought to be dead, and this still further increased theobscurity which had gathered about him. At Paris, one of the journalswhich chronicled the fact fell into his hands. He felt reassured andalmost at peace, as though he had really been dead.</p><p>On the evening of the day when Jean Valjean rescued Cosette from the clawsof the Thénardiers, he returned to Paris. He re-entered it at nightfall,with the child, by way of the Barrier Monceaux. There he entered acabriolet, which took him to the esplanade of the Observatoire. There hegot out, paid the coachman, took Cosette by the hand, and together theydirected their steps through the darkness,&mdash;through the desertedstreets which adjoin the Ourcine and the Glacière, towards the Boulevardde l&rsquo;Hôpital.</p><p>The day had been strange and filled with emotions for Cosette. They hadeaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns, behind hedges;they had changed carriages frequently; they had travelled short distanceson foot. She made no complaint, but she was weary, and Jean Valjeanperceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand as shewalked. He took her on his back. Cosette, without letting go of Catherine,laid her head on Jean Valjean&rsquo;s shoulder, and there fell asleep.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0120" id="link2H_4_0120"></a>BOOK FOURTH&mdash;THE GORBEAU HOVEL</h3><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0016" id="linkimage-0016"></a><img src="images/2b3-10-gorbeau-house.jpg" alt="The Gorbeau Hovel" width="100%" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0104" id="link2HCH0104"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;MASTER GORBEAU</h3><p>Forty years ago, a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country ofthe Salpêtrière, and who had mounted to the Barrière d&rsquo;Italie by way ofthe boulevard, reached a point where it might be said that Parisdisappeared. It was no longer solitude, for there were passers-by; it wasnot the country, for there were houses and streets; it was not the city,for the streets had ruts like highways, and the grass grew in them; it wasnot a village, the houses were too lofty. What was it, then? It was aninhabited spot where there was no one; it was a desert place where therewas some one; it was a boulevard of the great city, a street of Paris;more wild at night than the forest, more gloomy by day than a cemetery.</p><p>It was the old quarter of the Marché-aux-Chevaux.</p><p>The rambler, if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of thisMarché-aux-Chevaux; if he consented even to pass beyond the Rue duPetit-Banquier, after leaving on his right a garden protected by highwalls; then a field in which tan-bark mills rose like gigantic beaverhuts; then an enclosure encumbered with timber, with a heap of stumps,sawdust, and shavings, on which stood a large dog, barking; then a long,low, utterly dilapidated wall, with a little black door in mourning, ladenwith mosses, which were covered with flowers in the spring; then, in themost deserted spot, a frightful and decrepit building, on which ran theinscription in large letters: POST NO BILLS,&mdash;this daring ramblerwould have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the Rue desVignes-Saint-Marcel. There, near a factory, and between two garden walls,there could be seen, at that epoch, a mean building, which, at the firstglance, seemed as small as a thatched hovel, and which was, in reality, aslarge as a cathedral. It presented its side and gable to the public road;hence its apparent diminutiveness. Nearly the whole of the house washidden. Only the door and one window could be seen.</p><p>This hovel was only one story high.</p><p>The first detail that struck the observer was, that the door could neverhave been anything but the door of a hovel, while the window, if it hadbeen carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry, mighthave been the lattice of a lordly mansion.</p><p>The door was nothing but a collection of worm-eaten planks roughly boundtogether by cross-beams which resembled roughly hewn logs. It openeddirectly on a steep staircase of lofty steps, muddy, chalky,plaster-stained, dusty steps, of the same width as itself, which could beseen from the street, running straight up like a ladder and disappearingin the darkness between two walls. The top of the shapeless bay into whichthis door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which atriangular hole had been sawed, which served both as wicket and air-holewhen the door was closed. On the inside of the door the figures 52 hadbeen traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink, and abovethe scantling the same hand had daubed the number 50, so that onehesitated. Where was one? Above the door it said, &ldquo;Number 50&rdquo;; the insidereplied, &ldquo;no, Number 52.&rdquo; No one knows what dust-colored figures weresuspended like draperies from the triangular opening.</p><p>The window was large, sufficiently elevated, garnished with Venetianblinds, and with a frame in large square panes; only these large paneswere suffering from various wounds, which were both concealed and betrayedby an ingenious paper bandage. And the blinds, dislocated and unpasted,threatened passers-by rather than screened the occupants. The horizontalslats were missing here and there and had been naïvely replaced withboards nailed on perpendicularly; so that what began as a blind ended as ashutter. This door with an unclean, and this window with an honest thoughdilapidated air, thus beheld on the same house, produced the effect of twoincomplete beggars walking side by side, with different miens beneath thesame rags, the one having always been a mendicant, and the other havingonce been a gentleman.</p><p>The staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which hadbeen converted into a house. This edifice had, for its intestinal tube, along corridor, on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments ofvaried dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances,and rather more like stalls than cells. These chambers received theirlight from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood.</p><p>All this was dark, disagreeable, wan, melancholy, sepulchral; traversedaccording as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door, by cold rays orby icy winds. An interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort ofdwelling is the enormous size of the spiders.</p><p>To the left of the entrance door, on the boulevard side, at about theheight of a man from the ground, a small window which had been walled upformed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown thereas they passed by.</p><p>A portion of this building has recently been demolished. From what stillremains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days. Asa whole, it was not over a hundred years old. A hundred years is youth ina church and age in a house. It seems as though man&rsquo;s lodging partook ofhis ephemeral character, and God&rsquo;s house of his eternity.</p><p>The postmen called the house Number 50-52; but it was known in theneighborhood as the Gorbeau house.</p><p>Let us explain whence this appellation was derived.</p><p>Collectors of petty details, who become herbalists of anecdotes, and prickslippery dates into their memories with a pin, know that there was inParis, during the last century, about 1770, two attorneys at the Châteletnamed, one Corbeau (Raven), the other Renard (Fox). The two names had beenforestalled by La Fontaine. The opportunity was too fine for the lawyers;they made the most of it. A parody was immediately put in circulation inthe galleries of the court-house, in verses that limped a little:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Maître Corbeau, sur un dossier perché,<br/>    Tenait dans son bec une saisie exécutoire;<br/>Maître Renard, par l&rsquo;odeur alléché,<br/>    Lui fit à peu près cette histoire:<br/>        Hé! bonjour. Etc.<a href="#linknote-13" name="linknoteref-13" id="linknoteref-13">13</a></p><p>The two honest practitioners, embarrassed by the jests, and finding thebearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter whichfollowed them, resolved to get rid of their names, and hit upon theexpedient of applying to the king.</p><p>Their petition was presented to Louis XV. on the same day when the PapalNuncio, on the one hand, and the Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon on the other,both devoutly kneeling, were each engaged in putting on, in his Majesty&rsquo;spresence, a slipper on the bare feet of Madame du Barry, who had just gotout of bed. The king, who was laughing, continued to laugh, passed gaylyfrom the two bishops to the two lawyers, and bestowed on these limbs ofthe law their former names, or nearly so. By the kings command, MaîtreCorbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial letter and to callhimself Gorbeau. Maître Renard was less lucky; all he obtained was leaveto place a P in front of his R, and to call himself Prenard; so that thesecond name bore almost as much resemblance as the first.</p><p>Now, according to local tradition, this Maître Gorbeau had been theproprietor of the building numbered 50-52 on the Boulevard de l&rsquo;Hôpital.He was even the author of the monumental window.</p><p>Hence the edifice bore the name of the Gorbeau house.</p><p>Opposite this house, among the trees of the boulevard, rose a great elmwhich was three-quarters dead; almost directly facing it opens the Rue dela Barrière des Gobelins, a street then without houses, unpaved, plantedwith unhealthy trees, which was green or muddy according to the season,and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of Paris. An odor ofcopperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory.</p><p>The barrier was close at hand. In 1823 the city wall was still inexistence.</p><p>This barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind. It was the road toBicêtre. It was through it that, under the Empire and the Restoration,prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the day of theirexecution. It was there, that, about 1829, was committed that mysteriousassassination, called &ldquo;The assassination of the Fontainebleau barrier,&rdquo; whose authors justice was never able to discover; a melancholy problemwhich has never been elucidated, a frightful enigma which has never beenunriddled. Take a few steps, and you come upon that fatal Rue Croulebarbe,where Ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of Ivry to the sound of thunder, as inthe melodramas. A few paces more, and you arrive at the abominablepollarded elms of the Barrière Saint-Jacques, that expedient of thephilanthropist to conceal the scaffold, that miserable and shameful Placede Grève of a shop-keeping and bourgeois society, which recoiled beforethe death penalty, neither daring to abolish it with grandeur, nor touphold it with authority.</p><p>Leaving aside this Place Saint-Jacques, which was, as it were,predestined, and which has always been horrible, probably the mostmournful spot on that mournful boulevard, seven and thirty years ago, wasthe spot which even to-day is so unattractive, where stood the buildingNumber 50-52.</p><p>Bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty-five years later.The place was unpleasant. In addition to the gloomy thoughts whichassailed one there, one was conscious of being between the Salpêtrière, aglimpse of whose dome could be seen, and Bicêtre, whose outskirts one wasfairly touching; that is to say, between the madness of women and themadness of men. As far as the eye could see, one could perceive nothingbut the abattoirs, the city wall, and the fronts of a few factories,resembling barracks or monasteries; everywhere about stood hovels,rubbish, ancient walls blackened like cerecloths, new white walls likewinding-sheets; everywhere parallel rows of trees, buildings erected on aline, flat constructions, long, cold rows, and the melancholy sadness ofright angles. Not an unevenness of the ground, not a caprice in thearchitecture, not a fold. The <i>ensemble</i> was glacial, regular,hideous. Nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry. It is because symmetryis ennui, and ennui is at the very foundation of grief. Despair yawns.Something more terrible than a hell where one suffers may be imagined, andthat is a hell where one is bored. If such a hell existed, that bit of theBoulevard de l&rsquo;Hôpital might have formed the entrance to it.</p><p>Nevertheless, at nightfall, at the moment when the daylight is vanishing,especially in winter, at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from theelms their last russet leaves, when the darkness is deep and starless, orwhen the moon and the wind are making openings in the clouds and losingthemselves in the shadows, this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful. Theblack lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades, like morsels of theinfinite. The passer-by cannot refrain from recalling the innumerabletraditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet. The solitudeof this spot, where so many crimes have been committed, had somethingterrible about it. One almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps inthat darkness; all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious,and the long, hollow square, of which one caught a glimpse between eachtree, seemed graves: by day it was ugly; in the evening melancholy; bynight it was sinister.</p><p>In summer, at twilight, one saw, here and there, a few old women seated atthe foot of the elm, on benches mouldy with rain. These good old womenwere fond of begging.</p><p>However, this quarter, which had a superannuated rather than an antiqueair, was tending even then to transformation. Even at that time any onewho was desirous of seeing it had to make haste. Each day some detail ofthe whole effect was disappearing. For the last twenty years the stationof the Orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distractedit, as it does to-day. Wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital,a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city. Itseems as though, around these great centres of the movements of a people,the earth, full of germs, trembled and yawned, to engulf the ancientdwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth, at the rattle ofthese powerful machines, at the breath of these monstrous horses ofcivilization which devour coal and vomit fire. The old houses crumble andnew ones rise.</p><p>Since the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpêtrière, theancient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor and the Jardindes Plantes tremble, as they are violently traversed three or four timeseach day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses which, in agiven time, crowd back the houses to the right and the left; for there arethings which are odd when said that are rigorously exact; and just as itis true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts ofhouses to vegetate and grow, it is certain that the frequent passage ofvehicles enlarges streets. The symptoms of a new life are evident. In thisold provincial quarter, in the wildest nooks, the pavement shows itself,the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer, even where there are asyet no pedestrians. One morning,&mdash;a memorable morning in July, 1845,&mdash;blackpots of bitumen were seen smoking there; on that day it might be said thatcivilization had arrived in the Rue de l&rsquo;Ourcine, and that Paris hadentered the suburb of Saint-Marceau.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0105" id="link2HCH0105"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;A NEST FOR OWL AND A WARBLER</h3><p>It was in front of this Gorbeau house that Jean Valjean halted. Like wildbirds, he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest.</p><p>He fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, drew out a sort of a pass-key, openedthe door, entered, closed it again carefully, and ascended the staircase,still carrying Cosette.</p><p>At the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key, with whichhe opened another door. The chamber which he entered, and which he closedagain instantly, was a kind of moderately spacious attic, furnished with amattress laid on the floor, a table, and several chairs; a stove in whicha fire was burning, and whose embers were visible, stood in one corner. Alantern on the boulevard cast a vague light into this poor room. At theextreme end there was a dressing-room with a folding bed; Jean Valjeancarried the child to this bed and laid her down there without waking her.</p><p>He struck a match and lighted a candle. All this was prepared beforehandon the table, and, as he had done on the previous evening, he began toscrutinize Cosette&rsquo;s face with a gaze full of ecstasy, in which theexpression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to aberration. Thelittle girl, with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extremestrength and extreme weakness, had fallen asleep without knowing with whomshe was, and continued to sleep without knowing where she was.</p><p>Jean Valjean bent down and kissed that child&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>Nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother, who had also justfallen asleep.</p><p>The same sad, piercing, religious sentiment filled his heart.</p><p>He knelt beside Cosette&rsquo;s bed.</p><p>lt was broad daylight, and the child still slept. A wan ray of theDecember sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the ceilingin long threads of light and shade. All at once a heavily laden carrier&rsquo;scart, which was passing along the boulevard, shook the frail bed, like aclap of thunder, and made it quiver from top to bottom.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, madame!&rdquo; cried Cosette, waking with a start, &ldquo;here I am! here I am!&rdquo;</p><p>And she sprang out of bed, her eyes still half shut with the heaviness ofsleep, extending her arms towards the corner of the wall.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! mon Dieu, my broom!&rdquo; said she.</p><p>She opened her eyes wide now, and beheld the smiling countenance of JeanValjean.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! so it is true!&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;Good morning, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p><p>Children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly, beingthemselves by nature joy and happiness.</p><p>Cosette caught sight of Catherine at the foot of her bed, and tookpossession of her, and, as she played, she put a hundred questions to JeanValjean. Where was she? Was Paris very large? Was Madame Thénardier veryfar away? Was she to go back? etc., etc. All at once she exclaimed, &ldquo;Howpretty it is here!&rdquo;</p><p>It was a frightful hole, but she felt free.</p><p>&ldquo;Must I sweep?&rdquo; she resumed at last.</p><p>&ldquo;Play!&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>The day passed thus. Cosette, without troubling herself to understandanything, was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0106" id="link2HCH0106"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE</h3><p>On the following morning, at daybreak, Jean Valjean was still by Cosette&rsquo;sbedside; he watched there motionless, waiting for her to wake.</p><p>Some new thing had come into his soul.</p><p>Jean Valjean had never loved anything; for twenty-five years he had beenalone in the world. He had never been father, lover, husband, friend. Inthe prison he had been vicious, gloomy, chaste, ignorant, and shy. Theheart of that ex-convict was full of virginity. His sister and hissister&rsquo;s children had left him only a vague and far-off memory which hadfinally almost completely vanished; he had made every effort to find them,and not having been able to find them, he had forgotten them. Human natureis made thus; the other tender emotions of his youth, if he had ever hadany, had fallen into an abyss.</p><p>When he saw Cosette, when he had taken possession of her, carried her off,and delivered her, he felt his heart moved within him.</p><p>All the passion and affection within him awoke, and rushed towards thatchild. He approached the bed, where she lay sleeping, and trembled withjoy. He suffered all the pangs of a mother, and he knew not what it meant;for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is avery obscure and a very sweet thing.</p><p>Poor old man, with a perfectly new heart!</p><p>Only, as he was five and fifty, and Cosette eight years of age, all thatmight have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together intoa sort of ineffable light.</p><p>It was the second white apparition which he had encountered. The Bishophad caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon; Cosette caused thedawn of love to rise.</p><p>The early days passed in this dazzled state.</p><p>Cosette, on her side, had also, unknown to herself, become another being,poor little thing! She was so little when her mother left her, that she nolonger remembered her. Like all children, who resemble young shoots of thevine, which cling to everything, she had tried to love; she had notsucceeded. All had repulsed her,&mdash;the Thénardiers, their children,other children. She had loved the dog, and he had died, after whichnothing and nobody would have anything to do with her. It is a sad thingto say, and we have already intimated it, that, at eight years of age, herheart was cold. It was not her fault; it was not the faculty of lovingthat she lacked; alas! it was the possibility. Thus, from the very firstday, all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man. She feltthat which she had never felt before&mdash;a sensation of expansion.</p><p>The man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor; shethought Jean Valjean handsome, just as she thought the hovel pretty.</p><p>These are the effects of the dawn, of childhood, of joy. The novelty ofthe earth and of life counts for something here. Nothing is so charming asthe coloring reflection of happiness on a garret. We all have in our pasta delightful garret.</p><p>Nature, a difference of fifty years, had set a profound gulf between JeanValjean and Cosette; destiny filled in this gulf. Destiny suddenly unitedand wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences,differing in age, alike in sorrow. One, in fact, completed the other.Cosette&rsquo;s instinct sought a father, as Jean Valjean&rsquo;s instinct sought achild. To meet was to find each other. At the mysterious moment when theirhands touched, they were welded together. When these two souls perceivedeach other, they recognized each other as necessary to each other, andembraced each other closely.</p><p>Taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense, we maysay that, separated from every one by the walls of the tomb, Jean Valjeanwas the widower, and Cosette was the orphan: this situation caused JeanValjean to become Cosette&rsquo;s father after a celestial fashion.</p><p>And in truth, the mysterious impression produced on Cosette in the depthsof the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean grasping hers in thedark was not an illusion, but a reality. The entrance of that man into thedestiny of that child had been the advent of God.</p><p>Moreover, Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well. There he seemedperfectly secure.</p><p>The chamber with a dressing-room, which he occupied with Cosette, was theone whose window opened on the boulevard. This being the only window inthe house, no neighbors&rsquo; glances were to be feared from across the way orat the side.</p><p>The ground floor of Number 50-52, a sort of dilapidated penthouse, servedas a wagon-house for market-gardeners, and no communication existedbetween it and the first story. It was separated by the flooring, whichhad neither traps nor stairs, and which formed the diaphragm of thebuilding, as it were. The first story contained, as we have said, numerouschambers and several attics, only one of which was occupied by the oldwoman who took charge of Jean Valjean&rsquo;s housekeeping; all the rest wasuninhabited.</p><p>It was this old woman, ornamented with the name of the <i>principal lodger</i>,and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress, who had let himthe lodging on Christmas eve. He had represented himself to her as agentleman of means who had been ruined by Spanish bonds, who was comingthere to live with his little daughter. He had paid her six months inadvance, and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber anddressing-room, as we have seen. It was this good woman who had lighted thefire in the stove, and prepared everything on the evening of theirarrival.</p><p>Week followed week; these two beings led a happy life in that hovel.</p><p>Cosette laughed, chattered, and sang from daybreak. Children have theirmorning song as well as birds.</p><p>It sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand, allcracked with chilblains, and kissed it. The poor child, who was used tobeing beaten, did not know the meaning of this, and ran away in confusion.</p><p>At times she became serious and stared at her little black gown. Cosettewas no longer in rags; she was in mourning. She had emerged from misery,and she was entering into life.</p><p>Jean Valjean had undertaken to teach her to read. Sometimes, as he madethe child spell, he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evilthat he had learned to read in prison. This idea had ended in teaching achild to read. Then the ex-convict smiled with the pensive smile of theangels.</p><p>He felt in it a premeditation from on high, the will of some one who wasnot man, and he became absorbed in reverie. Good thoughts have theirabysses as well as evil ones.</p><p>To teach Cosette to read, and to let her play, this constituted nearly thewhole of Jean Valjean&rsquo;s existence. And then he talked of her mother, andhe made her pray.</p><p>She called him <i>father</i>, and knew no other name for him.</p><p>He passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll, and inlistening to her prattle. Life, henceforth, appeared to him to be full ofinterest; men seemed to him good and just; he no longer reproached any onein thought; he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man,now that this child loved him. He saw a whole future stretching out beforehim, illuminated by Cosette as by a charming light. The best of us are notexempt from egotistical thoughts. At times, he reflected with a sort ofjoy that she would be ugly.</p><p>This is only a personal opinion; but, to utter our whole thought, at thepoint where Jean Valjean had arrived when he began to love Cosette, it isby no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in orderthat he might persevere in well-doing. He had just viewed the malice ofmen and the misery of society under a new aspect&mdash;incomplete aspects,which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth, the fate ofwoman as summed up in Fantine, and public authority as personified inJavert. He had returned to prison, this time for having done right; he hadquaffed fresh bitterness; disgust and lassitude were overpowering him;even the memory of the Bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse,though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant; but, after all,that sacred memory was growing dim. Who knows whether Jean Valjean had notbeen on the eve of growing discouraged and of falling once more? He lovedand grew strong again. Alas! he walked with no less indecision thanCosette. He protected her, and she strengthened him. Thanks to him, shecould walk through life; thanks to her, he could continue in virtue. Hewas that child&rsquo;s stay, and she was his prop. Oh, unfathomable and divinemystery of the balances of destiny!</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0107" id="link2HCH0107"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE REMARKS OF THE PRINCIPAL TENANT</h3><p>Jean Valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day. Every evening, attwilight, he walked for an hour or two, sometimes alone, often withCosette, seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard, andentering churches at nightfall. He liked to go to Saint-Médard, which isthe nearest church. When he did not take Cosette with him, she remainedwith the old woman; but the child&rsquo;s delight was to go out with the goodman. She preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous <i>tête-à-têtes</i>with Catherine. He held her hand as they walked, and said sweet things toher.</p><p>It turned out that Cosette was a very gay little person.</p><p>The old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to market.</p><p>They lived soberly, always having a little fire, but like people in verymoderate circumstances. Jean Valjean had made no alterations in thefurniture as it was the first day; he had merely had the glass doorleading to Cosette&rsquo;s dressing-room replaced by a solid door.</p><p>He still wore his yellow coat, his black breeches, and his old hat. In thestreet, he was taken for a poor man. It sometimes happened thatkind-hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him. Jean Valjeanaccepted the sou with a deep bow. It also happened occasionally that heencountered some poor wretch asking alms; then he looked behind him tomake sure that no one was observing him, stealthily approached theunfortunate man, put a piece of money into his hand, often a silver coin,and walked rapidly away. This had its disadvantages. He began to be knownin the neighborhood under the name of <i>the beggar who gives alms</i>.</p><p>The old <i>principal lodger</i>, a cross-looking creature, who wasthoroughly permeated, so far as her neighbors were concerned, with theinquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons, scrutinized Jean Valjean agreat deal, without his suspecting the fact. She was a little deaf, whichrendered her talkative. There remained to her from her past, two teeth,&mdash;oneabove, the other below,&mdash;which she was continually knocking againsteach other. She had questioned Cosette, who had not been able to tell heranything, since she knew nothing herself except that she had come fromMontfermeil. One morning, this spy saw Jean Valjean, with an air whichstruck the old gossip as peculiar, entering one of the uninhabitedcompartments of the hovel. She followed him with the step of an old cat,and was able to observe him without being seen, through a crack in thedoor, which was directly opposite him. Jean Valjean had his back turnedtowards this door, by way of greater security, no doubt. The old woman sawhim fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case, scissors, and thread;then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his coat, and fromthe opening he took a bit of yellowish paper, which he unfolded. The oldwoman recognized, with terror, the fact that it was a bank-bill for athousand francs. It was the second or third only that she had seen in thecourse of her existence. She fled in alarm.</p><p>A moment later, Jean Valjean accosted her, and asked her to go and getthis thousand-franc bill changed for him, adding that it was his quarterlyincome, which he had received the day before. &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; thought the oldwoman. &ldquo;He did not go out until six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and thegovernment bank certainly is not open at that hour.&rdquo; The old woman went toget the bill changed, and mentioned her surmises. That thousand-francnote, commented on and multiplied, produced a vast amount of terrifieddiscussion among the gossips of the Rue des Vignes Saint-Marcel.</p><p>A few days later, it chanced that Jean Valjean was sawing some wood, inhis shirt-sleeves, in the corridor. The old woman was in the chamber,putting things in order. She was alone. Cosette was occupied in admiringthe wood as it was sawed. The old woman caught sight of the coat hangingon a nail, and examined it. The lining had been sewed up again. The goodwoman felt of it carefully, and thought she observed in the skirts andrevers thicknesses of paper. More thousand-franc bank-bills, no doubt!</p><p>She also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets. Notonly the needles, thread, and scissors which she had seen, but a bigpocket-book, a very large knife, and&mdash;a suspicious circumstance&mdash;severalwigs of various colors. Each pocket of this coat had the air of being in amanner provided against unexpected accidents.</p><p>Thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0108" id="link2HCH0108"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;A FIVE-FRANC PIECE FALLS ON THE GROUND AND PRODUCES ATUMULT</h3><p>Near Saint-Médard&rsquo;s church there was a poor man who was in the habit ofcrouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned, and onwhom Jean Valjean was fond of bestowing charity. He never passed this manwithout giving him a few sous. Sometimes he spoke to him. Those who enviedthis mendicant said that he belonged to the police. He was an ex-beadle ofseventy-five, who was constantly mumbling his prayers.</p><p>One evening, as Jean Valjean was passing by, when he had not Cosette withhim, he saw the beggar in his usual place, beneath the lantern which hadjust been lighted. The man seemed engaged in prayer, according to hiscustom, and was much bent over. Jean Valjean stepped up to him and placedhis customary alms in his hand. The mendicant raised his eyes suddenly,stared intently at Jean Valjean, then dropped his head quickly. Thismovement was like a flash of lightning. Jean Valjean was seized with ashudder. It seemed to him that he had just caught sight, by the light ofthe street lantern, not of the placid and beaming visage of the oldbeadle, but of a well-known and startling face. He experienced the sameimpression that one would have on finding one&rsquo;s self, all of a sudden,face to face, in the dark, with a tiger. He recoiled, terrified,petrified, daring neither to breathe, to speak, to remain, nor to flee,staring at the beggar who had dropped his head, which was enveloped in arag, and no longer appeared to know that he was there. At this strangemoment, an instinct&mdash;possibly the mysterious instinct ofself-preservation,&mdash;restrained Jean Valjean from uttering a word. Thebeggar had the same figure, the same rags, the same appearance as he hadevery day. &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, &ldquo;I am mad! I am dreaming!Impossible!&rdquo; And he returned profoundly troubled.</p><p>He hardly dared to confess, even to himself, that the face which hethought he had seen was the face of Javert.</p><p>That night, on thinking the matter over, he regretted not havingquestioned the man, in order to force him to raise his head a second time.</p><p>On the following day, at nightfall, he went back. The beggar was at hispost. &ldquo;Good day, my good man,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, resolutely, handing hima sou. The beggar raised his head, and replied in a whining voice,&ldquo;Thanks, my good sir.&rdquo; It was unmistakably the ex-beadle.</p><p>Jean Valjean felt completely reassured. He began to laugh. &ldquo;How the deucecould I have thought that I saw Javert there?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Am I going tolose my eyesight now?&rdquo; And he thought no more about it.</p><p>A few days afterwards,&mdash;it might have been at eight o&rsquo;clock in theevening,&mdash;he was in his room, and engaged in making Cosette spellaloud, when he heard the house door open and then shut again. This struckhim as singular. The old woman, who was the only inhabitant of the houseexcept himself, always went to bed at nightfall, so that she might notburn out her candles. Jean Valjean made a sign to Cosette to be quiet. Heheard some one ascending the stairs. It might possibly be the old woman,who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary&rsquo;s. JeanValjean listened.</p><p>The step was heavy, and sounded like that of a man; but the old woman worestout shoes, and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the step ofa man as that of an old woman. Nevertheless, Jean Valjean blew out hiscandle.</p><p>He had sent Cosette to bed, saying to her in a low voice, &ldquo;Get into bedvery softly&rdquo;; and as he kissed her brow, the steps paused.</p><p>Jean Valjean remained silent, motionless, with his back towards the door,seated on the chair from which he had not stirred, and holding his breathin the dark.</p><p>After the expiration of a rather long interval, he turned round, as heheard nothing more, and, as he raised his eyes towards the door of hischamber, he saw a light through the keyhole. This light formed a sort ofsinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall. There wasevidently some one there, who was holding a candle in his hand andlistening.</p><p>Several minutes elapsed thus, and the light retreated. But he heard nosound of footsteps, which seemed to indicate that the person who had beenlistening at the door had removed his shoes.</p><p>Jean Valjean threw himself, all dressed as he was, on his bed, and couldnot close his eyes all night.</p><p>At daybreak, just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue, he wasawakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the endof the corridor, then he heard the same masculine footstep which hadascended the stairs on the preceding evening. The step was approaching. Hesprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole, which was tolerablylarge, hoping to see the person who had made his way by night into thehouse and had listened at his door, as he passed. It was a man, in fact,who passed, this time without pausing, in front of Jean Valjean&rsquo;s chamber.The corridor was too dark to allow of the person&rsquo;s face beingdistinguished; but when the man reached the staircase, a ray of light fromwithout made it stand out like a silhouette, and Jean Valjean had acomplete view of his back. The man was of lofty stature, clad in a longfrock-coat, with a cudgel under his arm. The formidable neck and shouldersbelonged to Javert.</p><p>Jean Valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him throughhis window opening on the boulevard, but he would have been obliged toopen the window: he dared not.</p><p>It was evident that this man had entered with a key, and like himself. Whohad given him that key? What was the meaning of this?</p><p>When the old woman came to do the work, at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning,Jean Valjean cast a penetrating glance on her, but he did not questionher. The good woman appeared as usual.</p><p>As she swept up she remarked to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Possibly Monsieur may have heard some one come in last night?&rdquo;</p><p>At that age, and on that boulevard, eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening was thedead of the night.</p><p>&ldquo;That is true, by the way,&rdquo; he replied, in the most natural tone possible.&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was a new lodger who has come into the house,&rdquo; said the old woman.</p><p>&ldquo;And what is his name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly; Dumont, or Daumont, or some name of that sort.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And who is this Monsieur Dumont?&rdquo;</p><p>The old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes, and answered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;A gentleman of property, like yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>Perhaps she had no ulterior meaning. Jean Valjean thought he perceivedone.</p><p>When the old woman had taken her departure, he did up a hundred francswhich he had in a cupboard, into a roll, and put it in his pocket. Inspite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that hemight not be heard rattling silver, a hundred-sou piece escaped from hishands and rolled noisily on the floor.</p><p>When darkness came on, he descended and carefully scrutinized both sidesof the boulevard. He saw no one. The boulevard appeared to be absolutelydeserted. It is true that a person can conceal himself behind trees.</p><p>He went upstairs again.</p><p>&ldquo;Come.&rdquo; he said to Cosette.</p><p>He took her by the hand, and they both went out.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0126" id="link2H_4_0126"></a>BOOK FIFTH&mdash;FOR A BLACK HUNT, A MUTE PACK</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0109" id="link2HCH0109"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE ZIGZAGS OF STRATEGY</h3><p>An observation here becomes necessary, in view of the pages which thereader is about to peruse, and of others which will be met with furtheron.</p><p>The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself,has been absent from Paris for many years. Paris has been transformedsince he quitted it. A new city has arisen, which is, after a fashion,unknown to him. There is no need for him to say that he loves Paris: Parisis his mind&rsquo;s natal city. In consequence of demolitions andreconstructions, the Paris of his youth, that Paris which he bore awayreligiously in his memory, is now a Paris of days gone by. He must bepermitted to speak of that Paris as though it still existed. It ispossible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says, &ldquo;Insuch a street there stands such and such a house,&rdquo; neither street norhouse will any longer exist in that locality. Readers may verify the factsif they care to take the trouble. For his own part, he is unacquaintedwith the new Paris, and he writes with the old Paris before his eyes in anillusion which is precious to him. It is a delight to him to dream thatthere still lingers behind him something of that which he beheld when hewas in his own country, and that all has not vanished. So long as you goand come in your native land, you imagine that those streets are a matterof indifference to you; that those windows, those roofs, and those doorsare nothing to you; that those walls are strangers to you; that thosetrees are merely the first encountered haphazard; that those houses, whichyou do not enter, are useless to you; that the pavements which you treadare merely stones. Later on, when you are no longer there, you perceivethat the streets are dear to you; that you miss those roofs, those doors;and that those walls are necessary to you, those trees are well beloved byyou; that you entered those houses which you never entered, every day, andthat you have left a part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, inthose pavements. All those places which you no longer behold, which youmay never behold again, perchance, and whose memory you have cherished,take on a melancholy charm, recur to your mind with the melancholy of anapparition, make the holy land visible to you, and are, so to speak, thevery form of France, and you love them; and you call them up as they are,as they were, and you persist in this, and you will submit to no change:for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face ofyour mother.</p><p>May we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present? That said,we beg the reader to take note of it, and we continue.</p><p>Jean Valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the streets,taking the most intricate lines which he could devise, returning on histrack at times, to make sure that he was not being followed.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0017" id="linkimage-0017"></a><img src="images/2b5-1-black-hunt.jpg" alt="The Black Hunt" width="100%" /></div><p>This manœuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag. On soil where animprint of the track may be left, this manœuvre possesses, amongother advantages, that of deceiving the huntsmen and the dogs, by throwingthem on the wrong scent. In venery this is called <i>false re-imbushment</i>.</p><p>The moon was full that night. Jean Valjean was not sorry for this. Themoon, still very close to the horizon, cast great masses of light andshadow in the streets. Jean Valjean could glide along close to the houseson the dark side, and yet keep watch on the light side. He did not,perhaps, take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the dark sideescaped him. Still, in the deserted lanes which lie near the Rue Poliveau,he thought he felt certain that no one was following him.</p><p>Cosette walked on without asking any questions. The sufferings of thefirst six years of her life had instilled something passive into hernature. Moreover,&mdash;and this is a remark to which we shall frequentlyhave occasion to recur,&mdash;she had grown used, without being herselfaware of it, to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks ofdestiny. And then she was with him, and she felt safe.</p><p>Jean Valjean knew no more where he was going than did Cosette. He trustedin God, as she trusted in him. It seemed as though he also were clingingto the hand of some one greater than himself; he thought he felt a beingleading him, though invisible. However, he had no settled idea, no plan,no project. He was not even absolutely sure that it was Javert, and thenit might have been Javert, without Javert knowing that he was JeanValjean. Was not he disguised? Was not he believed to be dead? Still,queer things had been going on for several days. He wanted no more ofthem. He was determined not to return to the Gorbeau house. Like the wildanimal chased from its lair, he was seeking a hole in which he might hideuntil he could find one where he might dwell.</p><p>Jean Valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the Mouffetardquarter, which was already asleep, as though the discipline of the MiddleAges and the yoke of the curfew still existed; he combined in variousmanners, with cunning strategy, the Rue Censier and the Rue Copeau, theRue du Battoir-Saint-Victor and the Rue du Puits l&rsquo;Ermite. There arelodging houses in this locality, but he did not even enter one, findingnothing which suited him. He had no doubt that if any one had chanced tobe upon his track, they would have lost it.</p><p>As eleven o&rsquo;clock struck from Saint-Étienne-du-Mont, he was traversing theRue de Pontoise, in front of the office of the commissary of police,situated at No. 14. A few moments later, the instinct of which we havespoken above made him turn round. At that moment he saw distinctly, thanksto the commissary&rsquo;s lantern, which betrayed them, three men who werefollowing him closely, pass, one after the other, under that lantern, onthe dark side of the street. One of the three entered the alley leading tothe commissary&rsquo;s house. The one who marched at their head struck him asdecidedly suspicious.</p><p>&ldquo;Come, child,&rdquo; he said to Cosette; and he made haste to quit the RuePontoise.</p><p>He took a circuit, turned into the Passage des Patriarches, which wasclosed on account of the hour, strode along the Rue de l&rsquo;Épée-de-Bois andthe Rue de l&rsquo;Arbalète, and plunged into the Rue des Postes.</p><p>At that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets,where the College Rollin stands to-day, and where the RueNeuve-Sainte-Geneviève turns off.</p><p>It is understood, of course, that the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève is an oldstreet, and that a posting-chaise does not pass through the Rue des Postesonce in ten years. In the thirteenth century this Rue des Postes wasinhabited by potters, and its real name is Rue des Pots.</p><p>The moon cast a livid light into this open space. Jean Valjean went intoambush in a doorway, calculating that if the men were still following him,he could not fail to get a good look at them, as they traversed thisilluminated space.</p><p>In point of fact, three minutes had not elapsed when the men made theirappearance. There were four of them now. All were tall, dressed in long,brown coats, with round hats, and huge cudgels in their hands. Their greatstature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming than did theirsinister stride through the darkness. One would have pronounced them fourspectres disguised as bourgeois.</p><p>They halted in the middle of the space and formed a group, like men inconsultation. They had an air of indecision. The one who appeared to betheir leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in thedirection which Jean Valjean had taken; another seemed to indicate thecontrary direction with considerable obstinacy. At the moment when thefirst man wheeled round, the moon fell full in his face. Jean Valjeanrecognized Javert perfectly.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0110" id="link2HCH0110"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;IT IS LUCKY THAT THE PONT D&rsquo;AUSTERLITZ BEARS CARRIAGES</h3><p>Uncertainty was at an end for Jean Valjean: fortunately it still lastedfor the men. He took advantage of their hesitation. It was time lost forthem, but gained for him. He slipped from under the gate where he hadconcealed himself, and went down the Rue des Postes, towards the region ofthe Jardin des Plantes. Cosette was beginning to be tired. He took her inhis arms and carried her. There were no passers-by, and the streetlanterns had not been lighted on account of there being a moon.</p><p>He redoubled his pace.</p><p>In a few strides he had reached the Goblet potteries, on the front ofwhich the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancient inscription:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">De Goblet fils c&rsquo;est ici la fabrique;<br/>Venez choisir des cruches et des brocs,<br/>Des pots à fleurs, des tuyaux, de la brique.<br/>À tout venant le Cœur vend des Carreaux.<a href="#linknote-14" name="linknoteref-14" id="linknoteref-14">14</a></p><p>He left behind him the Rue de la Clef, then the Fountain Saint-Victor,skirted the Jardin des Plantes by the lower streets, and reached the quay.There he turned round. The quay was deserted. The streets were deserted.There was no one behind him. He drew a long breath.</p><p>He gained the Pont d&rsquo;Austerlitz.</p><p>Tolls were still collected there at that epoch.</p><p>He presented himself at the toll office and handed over a sou.</p><p>&ldquo;It is two sous,&rdquo; said the old soldier in charge of the bridge. &ldquo;You arecarrying a child who can walk. Pay for two.&rdquo;</p><p>He paid, vexed that his passage should have aroused remark. Every flightshould be an imperceptible slipping away.</p><p>A heavy cart was crossing the Seine at the same time as himself, and onits way, like him, to the right bank. This was of use to him. He couldtraverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart.</p><p>Towards the middle of the Bridge, Cosette, whose feet were benumbed,wanted to walk. He set her on the ground and took her hand again.</p><p>The bridge once crossed, he perceived some timber-yards on his right. Hedirected his course thither. In order to reach them, it was necessary torisk himself in a tolerably large unsheltered and illuminated space. Hedid not hesitate. Those who were on his track had evidently lost thescent, and Jean Valjean believed himself to be out of danger. Hunted, yes;followed, no.</p><p>A little street, the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, opened out betweentwo timber-yards enclosed in walls. This street was dark and narrow andseemed made expressly for him. Before entering it he cast a glance behindhim.</p><p>From the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the Pontd&rsquo;Austerlitz.</p><p>Four shadows were just entering on the bridge.</p><p>These shadows had their backs turned to the Jardin des Plantes and were ontheir way to the right bank.</p><p>These four shadows were the four men.</p><p>Jean Valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured.</p><p>One hope remained to him; it was, that the men had not, perhaps, steppedon the bridge, and had not caught sight of him while he was crossing thelarge illuminated space, holding Cosette by the hand.</p><p>In that case, by plunging into the little street before him, he mightescape, if he could reach the timber-yards, the marshes, themarket-gardens, the uninhabited ground which was not built upon.</p><p>It seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent littlestreet. He entered it.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0111" id="link2HCH0111"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;TO WIT, THE PLAN OF PARIS IN 1727</h3><p>Three hundred paces further on, he arrived at a point where the streetforked. It separated into two streets, which ran in a slanting line, oneto the right, and the other to the left.</p><p>Jean Valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of a Y. Whichshould he choose? He did not hesitate, but took the one on the right.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because that to the left ran towards a suburb, that is to say, towardsinhabited regions, and the right branch towards the open country, that isto say, towards deserted regions.</p><p>However, they no longer walked very fast. Cosette&rsquo;s pace retarded JeanValjean&rsquo;s.</p><p>He took her up and carried her again. Cosette laid her head on theshoulder of the good man and said not a word.</p><p>He turned round from time to time and looked behind him. He took care tokeep always on the dark side of the street. The street was straight in hisrear. The first two or three times that he turned round he saw nothing;the silence was profound, and he continued his march somewhat reassured.All at once, on turning round, he thought he perceived in the portion ofthe street which he had just passed through, far off in the obscurity,something which was moving.</p><p>He rushed forward precipitately rather than walked, hoping to find someside-street, to make his escape through it, and thus to break his scentonce more.</p><p>He arrived at a wall.</p><p>This wall, however, did not absolutely prevent further progress; it was awall which bordered a transverse street, in which the one he had takenended.</p><p>Here again, he was obliged to come to a decision; should he go to theright or to the left.</p><p>He glanced to the right. The fragmentary lane was prolonged betweenbuildings which were either sheds or barns, then ended at a blind alley.The extremity of the cul-de-sac was distinctly visible,&mdash;a loftywhite wall.</p><p>He glanced to the left. On that side the lane was open, and about twohundred paces further on, ran into a street of which it was the affluent.On that side lay safety.</p><p>At the moment when Jean Valjean was meditating a turn to the left, in aneffort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane, heperceived a sort of motionless, black statue at the corner of the lane andthe street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps.</p><p>It was some one, a man, who had evidently just been posted there, and whowas barring the passage and waiting.</p><p>Jean Valjean recoiled.</p><p>The point of Paris where Jean Valjean found himself, situated between theFaubourg Saint-Antoine and la Râpée, is one of those which recentimprovements have transformed from top to bottom,&mdash;resulting indisfigurement according to some, and in a transfiguration according toothers. The market-gardens, the timber-yards, and the old buildings havebeen effaced. To-day, there are brand-new, wide streets, arenas, circuses,hippodromes, railway stations, and a prison, Mazas, there; progress, asthe reader sees, with its antidote.</p><p>Half a century ago, in that ordinary, popular tongue, which is allcompounded of traditions, which persists in calling the Institut <i>lesQuatre-Nations</i>, and the Opera-Comique <i>Feydeau</i>, the precise spotwhither Jean Valjean had arrived was called <i>le Petit-Picpus</i>. ThePorte Saint-Jacques, the Porte Paris, the Barrière des Sergents, thePorcherons, la Galiote, les Célestins, les Capucins, le Mail, la Bourbe,l&rsquo;Arbre de Cracovie, la Petite-Pologne&mdash;these are the names of oldParis which survive amid the new. The memory of the populace hovers overthese relics of the past.</p><p>Le Petit-Picpus, which, moreover, hardly ever had any existence, and neverwas more than the outline of a quarter, had nearly the monkish aspect of aSpanish town. The roads were not much paved; the streets were not muchbuilt up. With the exception of the two or three streets, of which weshall presently speak, all was wall and solitude there. Not a shop, not avehicle, hardly a candle lighted here and there in the windows; all lightsextinguished after ten o&rsquo;clock. Gardens, convents, timber-yards, marshes;occasional lowly dwellings and great walls as high as the houses.</p><p>Such was this quarter in the last century. The Revolution snubbed itsoundly. The republican government demolished and cut through it. Rubbishshoots were established there. Thirty years ago, this quarter wasdisappearing under the erasing process of new buildings. To-day, it hasbeen utterly blotted out. The Petit-Picpus, of which no existing plan haspreserved a trace, is indicated with sufficient clearness in the plan of1727, published at Paris by Denis Thierry, Rue Saint-Jacques, opposite theRue du Plâtre; and at Lyons, by Jean Girin, Rue Mercière, at the sign ofPrudence. Petit-Picpus had, as we have just mentioned, a Y of streets,formed by the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, which spread out in twobranches, taking on the left the name of Little Picpus Street, and on theright the name of the Rue Polonceau. The two limbs of the Y were connectedat the apex as by a bar; this bar was called Rue Droit-Mur. The RuePolonceau ended there; Rue Petit-Picpus passed on, and ascended towardsthe Lenoir market. A person coming from the Seine reached the extremity ofthe Rue Polonceau, and had on his right the Rue Droit-Mur, turningabruptly at a right angle, in front of him the wall of that street, and onhis right a truncated prolongation of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had noissue and was called the Cul-de-Sac Genrot.</p><p>It was here that Jean Valjean stood.</p><p>As we have just said, on catching sight of that black silhouette standingon guard at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur and the Rue Petit-Picpus, herecoiled. There could be no doubt of it. That phantom was lying in waitfor him.</p><p>What was he to do?</p><p>The time for retreating was passed. That which he had perceived inmovement an instant before, in the distant darkness, was Javert and hissquad without a doubt. Javert was probably already at the commencement ofthe street at whose end Jean Valjean stood. Javert, to all appearances,was acquainted with this little labyrinth, and had taken his precautionsby sending one of his men to guard the exit. These surmises, which soclosely resembled proofs, whirled suddenly, like a handful of dust caughtup by an unexpected gust of wind, through Jean Valjean&rsquo;s mournful brain.He examined the Cul-de-Sac Genrot; there he was cut off. He examined theRue Petit-Picpus; there stood a sentinel. He saw that black form standingout in relief against the white pavement, illuminated by the moon; toadvance was to fall into this man&rsquo;s hands; to retreat was to fling himselfinto Javert&rsquo;s arms. Jean Valjean felt himself caught, as in a net, whichwas slowly contracting; he gazed heavenward in despair.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0112" id="link2HCH0112"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE GROPINGS OF FLIGHT</h3><p>In order to understand what follows, it is requisite to form an exact ideaof the Droit-Mur lane, and, in particular, of the angle which one leaveson the left when one emerges from the Rue Polonceau into this lane.Droit-Mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right, as far as theRue Petit-Picpus, by houses of mean aspect; on the left by a solitarybuilding of severe outlines, composed of numerous parts which grewgradually higher by a story or two as they approached the Rue Petit-Picpusside; so that this building, which was very lofty on the Rue Petit-Picpusside, was tolerably low on the side adjoining the Rue Polonceau. There, atthe angle of which we have spoken, it descended to such a degree that itconsisted of merely a wall. This wall did not abut directly on the street;it formed a deeply retreating niche, concealed by its two corners from twoobservers who might have been, one in the Rue Polonceau, the other in theRue Droit-Mur.</p><p>Beginning with these angles of the niche, the wall extended along the RuePolonceau as far as a house which bore the number 49, and along the RueDroit-Mur, where the fragment was much shorter, as far as the gloomybuilding which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected, thusforming another retreating angle in the street. This gable was sombre ofaspect; only one window was visible, or, to speak more correctly, twoshutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed.</p><p>The state of the places of which we are here giving a description isrigorously exact, and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in themind of old inhabitants of the quarter.</p><p>The niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal andwretched door; it was a vast, formless assemblage of perpendicular planks,the upper ones being broader than the lower, bound together by longtransverse strips of iron. At one side there was a carriage gate of theordinary dimensions, and which had evidently not been cut more than fiftyyears previously.</p><p>A linden-tree showed its crest above the niche, and the wall was coveredwith ivy on the side of the Rue Polonceau.</p><p>In the imminent peril in which Jean Valjean found himself, this sombrebuilding had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him.He ran his eyes rapidly over it; he said to himself, that if he couldcontrive to get inside it, he might save himself. First he conceived anidea, then a hope.</p><p>In the central portion of the front of this building, on the Rue Droit-Murside, there were at all the windows of the different stories ancientcistern pipes of lead. The various branches of the pipes which led fromone central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sort of tree onthe front. These ramifications of pipes with their hundred elbows imitatedthose old leafless vine-stocks which writhe over the fronts of oldfarm-houses.</p><p>This odd espalier, with its branches of lead and iron, was the first thingthat struck Jean Valjean. He seated Cosette with her back against a stonepost, with an injunction to be silent, and ran to the spot where theconduit touched the pavement. Perhaps there was some way of climbing up byit and entering the house. But the pipe was dilapidated and past service,and hardly hung to its fastenings. Moreover, all the windows of thissilent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars, even the attic windowsin the roof. And then, the moon fell full upon that façade, and the manwho was watching at the corner of the street would have seen Jean Valjeanin the act of climbing. And finally, what was to be done with Cosette? Howwas she to be drawn up to the top of a three-story house?</p><p>He gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain-pipe, and crawledalong the wall to get back into the Rue Polonceau.</p><p>When he reached the slant of the wall where he had left Cosette, henoticed that no one could see him there. As we have just explained, he wasconcealed from all eyes, no matter from which direction they wereapproaching; besides this, he was in the shadow. Finally, there were twodoors; perhaps they might be forced. The wall above which he saw thelinden-tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he could, atleast, hide himself, although there were as yet no leaves on the trees,and spend the remainder of the night.</p><p>Time was passing; he must act quickly.</p><p>He felt over the carriage door, and immediately recognized the fact thatit was impracticable outside and in.</p><p>He approached the other door with more hope; it was frightfully decrepit;its very immensity rendered it less solid; the planks were rotten; theiron bands&mdash;there were only three of them&mdash;were rusted. Itseemed as though it might be possible to pierce this worm-eaten barrier.</p><p>On examining it he found that the door was not a door; it had neitherhinges, cross-bars, lock, nor fissure in the middle; the iron bandstraversed it from side to side without any break. Through the crevices inthe planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stone roughlycemented together, which passers-by might still have seen there ten yearsago. He was forced to acknowledge with consternation that this apparentdoor was simply the wooden decoration of a building against which it wasplaced. It was easy to tear off a plank; but then, one found one&rsquo;s selfface to face with a wall.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0113" id="link2HCH0113"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH GAS LANTERNS</h3><p>At that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at somedistance. Jean Valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street.Seven or eight soldiers, drawn up in a platoon, had just debouched intothe Rue Polonceau. He saw the gleam of their bayonets. They were advancingtowards him; these soldiers, at whose head he distinguished Javert&rsquo;s tallfigure, advanced slowly and cautiously. They halted frequently; it wasplain that they were searching all the nooks of the walls and all theembrasures of the doors and alleys.</p><p>This was some patrol that Javert had encountered&mdash;there could be nomistake as to this surmise&mdash;and whose aid he had demanded.</p><p>Javert&rsquo;s two acolytes were marching in their ranks.</p><p>At the rate at which they were marching, and in consideration of the haltswhich they were making, it would take them about a quarter of an hour toreach the spot where Jean Valjean stood. It was a frightful moment. A fewminutes only separated Jean Valjean from that terrible precipice whichyawned before him for the third time. And the galleys now meant not onlythe galleys, but Cosette lost to him forever; that is to say, a liferesembling the interior of a tomb.</p><p>There was but one thing which was possible.</p><p>Jean Valjean had this peculiarity, that he carried, as one might say, twobeggar&rsquo;s pouches: in one he kept his saintly thoughts; in the other theredoubtable talents of a convict. He rummaged in the one or the other,according to circumstances.</p><p>Among his other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes from the prisonat Toulon, he was, as it will be remembered, a past master in theincredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing-irons, by sheermuscular force, by leaning on the nape of his neck, his shoulders, hiships, and his knees, by helping himself on the rare projections of thestone, in the right angle of a wall, as high as the sixth story, if needbe; an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner ofthe wall of the Conciergerie of Paris by which Battemolle, condemned todeath, made his escape twenty years ago.</p><p>Jean Valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied thelinden; it was about eighteen feet in height. The angle which it formedwith the gable of the large building was filled, at its lower extremity,by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape, probably intended to preservethat too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty creaturescalled the passers-by. This practice of filling up corners of the wall ismuch in use in Paris.</p><p>This mass was about five feet in height; the space above the summit ofthis mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen feet.</p><p>The wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping.</p><p>Cosette was the difficulty, for she did not know how to climb a wall.Should he abandon her? Jean Valjean did not once think of that. It wasimpossible to carry her. A man&rsquo;s whole strength is required tosuccessfully carry out these singular ascents. The least burden woulddisturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards.</p><p>A rope would have been required; Jean Valjean had none. Where was he toget a rope at midnight, in the Rue Polonceau? Certainly, if Jean Valjeanhad had a kingdom, he would have given it for a rope at that moment.</p><p>All extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimesdazzle, sometimes illuminate us.</p><p>Jean Valjean&rsquo;s despairing glance fell on the street lantern-post of theblind alley Genrot.</p><p>At that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris. At nightfalllanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; they were ascended anddescended by means of a rope, which traversed the street from side toside, and was adjusted in a groove of the post. The pulley over which thisrope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little iron box, the keyto which was kept by the lamp-lighter, and the rope itself was protectedby a metal case.</p><p>Jean Valjean, with the energy of a supreme struggle, crossed the street atone bound, entered the blind alley, broke the latch of the little box withthe point of his knife, and an instant later he was beside Cosette oncemore. He had a rope. These gloomy inventors of expedients work rapidlywhen they are fighting against fatality.</p><p>We have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted thatnight. The lantern in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot was thus naturally extinct,like the rest; and one could pass directly under it without even noticingthat it was no longer in its place.</p><p>Nevertheless, the hour, the place, the darkness, Jean Valjean&rsquo;sabsorption, his singular gestures, his goings and comings, all had begunto render Cosette uneasy. Any other child than she would have given ventto loud shrieks long before. She contented herself with plucking JeanValjean by the skirt of his coat. They could hear the sound of thepatrol&rsquo;s approach ever more and more distinctly.</p><p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said she, in a very low voice, &ldquo;I am afraid. Who is comingyonder?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; replied the unhappy man; &ldquo;it is Madame Thénardier.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette shuddered. He added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Say nothing. Don&rsquo;t interfere with me. If you cry out, if you weep, theThénardier is lying in wait for you. She is coming to take you back.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, without haste, but without making a useless movement, with firm andcurt precision, the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and Javertmight come upon him at any moment, he undid his cravat, passed it roundCosette&rsquo;s body under the armpits, taking care that it should not hurt thechild, fastened this cravat to one end of the rope, by means of that knotwhich seafaring men call a &ldquo;swallow knot,&rdquo; took the other end of the ropein his teeth, pulled off his shoes and stockings, which he threw over thewall, stepped upon the mass of masonry, and began to raise himself in theangle of the wall and the gable with as much solidity and certainty asthough he had the rounds of a ladder under his feet and elbows. Half aminute had not elapsed when he was resting on his knees on the wall.</p><p>Cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement, without uttering a word. JeanValjean&rsquo;s injunction, and the name of Madame Thénardier, had chilled herblood.</p><p>All at once she heard Jean Valjean&rsquo;s voice crying to her, though in a verylow tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Put your back against the wall.&rdquo;</p><p>She obeyed.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word, and don&rsquo;t be alarmed,&rdquo; went on Jean Valjean.</p><p>And she felt herself lifted from the ground.</p><p>Before she had time to recover herself, she was on the top of the wall.</p><p>Jean Valjean grasped her, put her on his back, took her two tiny hands inhis large left hand, lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along on topof the wall as far as the cant. As he had guessed, there stood a buildingwhose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade and descended towithin a very short distance of the ground, with a gentle slope whichgrazed the linden-tree. A lucky circumstance, for the wall was much higheron this side than on the street side. Jean Valjean could only see theground at a great depth below him.</p><p>He had just reached the slope of the roof, and had not yet left the crestof the wall, when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the patrol.The thundering voice of Javert was audible:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Search the blind alley! The Rue Droit-Mur is guarded! so is the RuePetit-Picpus. I&rsquo;ll answer for it that he is in the blind alley.&rdquo;</p><p>The soldiers rushed into the Genrot alley.</p><p>Jean Valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof, still holding fast toCosette, reached the linden-tree, and leaped to the ground. Whether fromterror or courage, Cosette had not breathed a sound, though her hands werea little abraded.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0114" id="link2HCH0114"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE BEGINNING OF AN ENIGMA</h3><p>Jean Valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast and ofsingular aspect; one of those melancholy gardens which seem made to belooked at in winter and at night. This garden was oblong in shape, with analley of large poplars at the further end, tolerably tall forest trees inthe corners, and an unshaded space in the centre, where could be seen avery large, solitary tree, then several fruit-trees, gnarled and bristlinglike bushes, beds of vegetables, a melon patch, whose glass framessparkled in the moonlight, and an old well. Here and there stood stonebenches which seemed black with moss. The alleys were bordered with gloomyand very erect little shrubs. The grass had half taken possession of them,and a green mould covered the rest.</p><p>Jean Valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as ameans of descent, a pile of fagots, and, behind the fagots, directlyagainst the wall, a stone statue, whose mutilated face was no longeranything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through thegloom.</p><p>The building was a sort of ruin, where dismantled chambers weredistinguishable, one of which, much encumbered, seemed to serve as a shed.</p><p>The large building of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had a wing on the RuePetit-Picpus, turned two façades, at right angles, towards this garden.These interior façades were even more tragic than the exterior. All thewindows were grated. Not a gleam of light was visible at any one of them.The upper story had scuttles like prisons. One of those façades cast itsshadow on the other, which fell over the garden like an immense blackpall.</p><p>No other house was visible. The bottom of the garden was lost in mist anddarkness. Nevertheless, walls could be confusedly made out, whichintersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond, and the lowroofs of the Rue Polonceau.</p><p>Nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined. Therewas no one in it, which was quite natural in view of the hour; but it didnot seem as though this spot were made for any one to walk in, even inbroad daylight.</p><p>Jean Valjean&rsquo;s first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put themon again, then to step under the shed with Cosette. A man who is fleeingnever thinks himself sufficiently hidden. The child, whose thoughts werestill on the Thénardier, shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight asmuch as possible.</p><p>Cosette trembled and pressed close to him. They heard the tumultuous noiseof the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets; the blows oftheir gun-stocks against the stones; Javert&rsquo;s appeals to the police spieswhom he had posted, and his imprecations mingled with words which couldnot be distinguished.</p><p>At the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that speciesof stormy roar were becoming more distant. Jean Valjean held his breath.</p><p>He had laid his hand lightly on Cosette&rsquo;s mouth.</p><p>However, the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm, that thisfrightful uproar, close and furious as it was, did not disturb him by somuch as the shadow of a misgiving. It seemed as though those walls hadbeen built of the deaf stones of which the Scriptures speak.</p><p>All at once, in the midst of this profound calm, a fresh sound arose; asound as celestial, divine, ineffable, ravishing, as the other had beenhorrible. It was a hymn which issued from the gloom, a dazzling burst ofprayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night;women&rsquo;s voices, but voices composed at one and the same time of the pureaccents of virgins and the innocent accents of children,&mdash;voiceswhich are not of the earth, and which resemble those that the newborninfant still hears, and which the dying man hears already. This songproceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden. At themoment when the hubbub of demons retreated, one would have said that achoir of angels was approaching through the gloom.</p><p>Cosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees.</p><p>They knew not what it was, they knew not where they were; but both ofthem, the man and the child, the penitent and the innocent, felt that theymust kneel.</p><p>These voices had this strange characteristic, that they did not preventthe building from seeming to be deserted. It was a supernatural chant inan uninhabited house.</p><p>While these voices were singing, Jean Valjean thought of nothing. He nolonger beheld the night; he beheld a blue sky. It seemed to him that hefelt those wings which we all have within us, unfolding.</p><p>The song died away. It may have lasted a long time. Jean Valjean could nothave told. Hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment.</p><p>All fell silent again. There was no longer anything in the street; therewas nothing in the garden. That which had menaced, that which hadreassured him,&mdash;all had vanished. The breeze swayed a few dry weedson the crest of the wall, and they gave out a faint, sweet, melancholysound.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0115" id="link2HCH0115"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;CONTINUATION OF THE ENIGMA</h3><p>The night wind had risen, which indicated that it must be between one andtwo o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Poor Cosette said nothing. As she had seatedherself beside him and leaned her head against him, Jean Valjean hadfancied that she was asleep. He bent down and looked at her. Cosette&rsquo;seyes were wide open, and her thoughtful air pained Jean Valjean.</p><p>She was still trembling.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sleepy?&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;I am very cold,&rdquo; she replied.</p><p>A moment later she resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is she still there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;Madame Thénardier.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed to makeCosette keep silent.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she is gone. You need fear nothing further.&rdquo;</p><p>The child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast.</p><p>The ground was damp, the shed open on all sides, the breeze grew more keenevery instant. The goodman took off his coat and wrapped it round Cosette.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you less cold now?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, wait for me a moment. I will soon be back.&rdquo;</p><p>He quitted the ruin and crept along the large building, seeking a bettershelter. He came across doors, but they were closed. There were bars atall the windows of the ground floor.</p><p>Just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice, he observed thathe was coming to some arched windows, where he perceived a light. He stoodon tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows. They all opened on atolerably vast hall, paved with large flagstones, cut up by arcades andpillars, where only a tiny light and great shadows were visible. The lightcame from a taper which was burning in one corner. The apartment wasdeserted, and nothing was stirring in it. Nevertheless, by dint of gazingintently he thought he perceived on the ground something which appeared tobe covered with a winding-sheet, and which resembled a human form. Thisform was lying face downward, flat on the pavement, with the arms extendedin the form of a cross, in the immobility of death. One would have said,judging from a sort of serpent which undulated over the floor, that thissinister form had a rope round its neck.</p><p>The whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparelyilluminated, which adds to horror.</p><p>Jean Valjean often said afterwards, that, although many funereal spectreshad crossed his path in life, he had never beheld anything moreblood-curdling and terrible than that enigmatical form accomplishing someinexplicable mystery in that gloomy place, and beheld thus at night. Itwas alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead; and still morealarming to think that it was perhaps alive.</p><p>He had the courage to plaster his face to the glass, and to watch whetherthe thing would move. In spite of his remaining thus what seemed to him avery long time, the outstretched form made no movement. All at once hefelt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror, and he fled. He beganto run towards the shed, not daring to look behind him. It seemed to him,that if he turned his head, he should see that form following him withgreat strides and waving its arms.</p><p>He reached the ruin all out of breath. His knees were giving way beneathhim; the perspiration was pouring from him.</p><p>Where was he? Who could ever have imagined anything like that sort ofsepulchre in the midst of Paris! What was this strange house? An edificefull of nocturnal mystery, calling to souls through the darkness with thevoice of angels, and when they came, offering them abruptly that terriblevision; promising to open the radiant portals of heaven, and then openingthe horrible gates of the tomb! And it actually was an edifice, a house,which bore a number on the street! It was not a dream! He had to touch thestones to convince himself that such was the fact.</p><p>Cold, anxiety, uneasiness, the emotions of the night, had given him agenuine fever, and all these ideas were clashing together in his brain.</p><p>He stepped up to Cosette. She was asleep.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0116" id="link2HCH0116"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE ENIGMA BECOMES DOUBLY MYSTERIOUS</h3><p>The child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep.</p><p>He sat down beside her and began to think. Little by little, as he gazedat her, he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of mind.</p><p>He clearly perceived this truth, the foundation of his life henceforth,that so long as she was there, so long as he had her near him, he shouldneed nothing except for her, he should fear nothing except for her. He wasnot even conscious that he was very cold, since he had taken off his coatto cover her.</p><p>Nevertheless, athwart this reverie into which he had fallen he had heardfor some time a peculiar noise. It was like the tinkling of a bell. Thissound proceeded from the garden. It could be heard distinctly thoughfaintly. It resembled the faint, vague music produced by the bells ofcattle at night in the pastures.</p><p>This noise made Valjean turn round.</p><p>He looked and saw that there was some one in the garden.</p><p>A being resembling a man was walking amid the bell-glasses of the melonbeds, rising, stooping, halting, with regular movements, as though he weredragging or spreading out something on the ground. This person appeared tolimp.</p><p>Jean Valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy. For themeverything is hostile and suspicious. They distrust the day because itenables people to see them, and the night because it aids in surprisingthem. A little while before he had shivered because the garden wasdeserted, and now he shivered because there was some one there.</p><p>He fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors. He said to himselfthat Javert and the spies had, perhaps, not taken their departure; thatthey had, no doubt, left people on the watch in the street; that if thisman should discover him in the garden, he would cry out for help againstthieves and deliver him up. He took the sleeping Cosette gently in hisarms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture, which was out of use,in the most remote corner of the shed. Cosette did not stir.</p><p>From that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melonpatch. The strange thing about it was, that the sound of the bell followedeach of this man&rsquo;s movements. When the man approached, the soundapproached; when the man retreated, the sound retreated; if he made anyhasty gesture, a tremolo accompanied the gesture; when he halted, thesound ceased. It appeared evident that the bell was attached to that man;but what could that signify? Who was this man who had a bell suspendedabout him like a ram or an ox?</p><p>As he put these questions to himself, he touched Cosette&rsquo;s hands. Theywere icy cold.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! good God!&rdquo; he cried.</p><p>He spoke to her in a low voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette!&rdquo;</p><p>She did not open her eyes.</p><p>He shook her vigorously.</p><p>She did not wake.</p><p>&ldquo;Is she dead?&rdquo; he said to himself, and sprang to his feet, quivering fromhead to foot.</p><p>The most frightful thoughts rushed pell-mell through his mind. There aremoments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies, andviolently force the partitions of our brains. When those we love are inquestion, our prudence invents every sort of madness. He remembered thatsleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal.</p><p>Cosette was pale, and had fallen at full length on the ground at his feet,without a movement.</p><p>He listened to her breathing: she still breathed, but with a respirationwhich seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction.</p><p>How was he to warm her back to life? How was he to rouse her? All that wasnot connected with this vanished from his thoughts. He rushed wildly fromthe ruin.</p><p>It was absolutely necessary that Cosette should be in bed and beside afire in less than a quarter of an hour.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0117" id="link2HCH0117"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE MAN WITH THE BELL</h3><p>He walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden. He had takenin his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat.</p><p>The man&rsquo;s head was bent down, and he did not see him approaching. In a fewstrides Jean Valjean stood beside him.</p><p>Jean Valjean accosted him with the cry:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;One hundred francs!&rdquo;</p><p>The man gave a start and raised his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You can earn a hundred francs,&rdquo; went on Jean Valjean, &ldquo;if you will grantme shelter for this night.&rdquo;</p><p>The moon shone full upon Jean Valjean&rsquo;s terrified countenance.</p><p>&ldquo;What! so it is you, Father Madeleine!&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>That name, thus pronounced, at that obscure hour, in that unknown spot, bythat strange man, made Jean Valjean start back.</p><p>He had expected anything but that. The person who thus addressed him was abent and lame old man, dressed almost like a peasant, who wore on his leftknee a leather knee-cap, whence hung a moderately large bell. His face,which was in the shadow, was not distinguishable.</p><p>However, the goodman had removed his cap, and exclaimed, trembling allover:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, good God! How come you here, Father Madeleine? Where did you enter?Dieu-Jésus! Did you fall from heaven? There is no trouble about that: ifever you do fall, it will be from there. And what a state you are in! Youhave no cravat; you have no hat; you have no coat! Do you know, you wouldhave frightened any one who did not know you? No coat! Lord God! Are thesaints going mad nowadays? But how did you get in here?&rdquo;</p><p>His words tumbled over each other. The goodman talked with a rusticvolubility, in which there was nothing alarming. All this was uttered witha mixture of stupefaction and <i>naïve</i> kindliness.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you? and what house is this?&rdquo; demanded Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! pardieu, this is too much!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man. &ldquo;I am the personfor whom you got the place here, and this house is the one where you hadme placed. What! You don&rsquo;t recognize me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean; &ldquo;and how happens it that you know me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You saved my life,&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>He turned. A ray of moonlight outlined his profile, and Jean Valjeanrecognized old Fauchelevent.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, &ldquo;so it is you? Yes, I recollect you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is very lucky,&rdquo; said the old man, in a reproachful tone.</p><p>&ldquo;And what are you doing here?&rdquo; resumed Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, I am covering my melons, of course!&rdquo;</p><p>In fact, at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him, old Faucheleventheld in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in spreadingover the melon bed. During the hour or thereabouts that he had been in thegarden he had already spread out a number of them. It was this operationwhich had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from theshed by Jean Valjean.</p><p>He continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I said to myself, &lsquo;The moon is bright: it is going to freeze. What if Iwere to put my melons into their greatcoats?&rsquo; And,&rdquo; he added, looking atJean Valjean with a broad smile,&mdash;&ldquo;pardieu! you ought to have donethe same! But how do you come here?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean, finding himself known to this man, at least only under thename of Madeleine, thenceforth advanced only with caution. He multipliedhis questions. Strange to say, their rôles seemed to be reversed. It washe, the intruder, who interrogated.</p><p>&ldquo;And what is this bell which you wear on your knee?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; replied Fauchelevent, &ldquo;is so that I may be avoided.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! so that you may be avoided?&rdquo;</p><p>Old Fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, goodness! there are only women in this house&mdash;many young girls.It appears that I should be a dangerous person to meet. The bell givesthem warning. When I come, they go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What house is this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come, you know well enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I do not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not when you got me the place here as gardener?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Answer me as though I knew nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, this is the Petit-Picpus convent.&rdquo;</p><p>Memories recurred to Jean Valjean. Chance, that is to say, Providence, hadcast him into precisely that convent in the Quartier Saint-Antoine whereold Fauchelevent, crippled by the fall from his cart, had been admitted onhis recommendation two years previously. He repeated, as though talking tohimself:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The Petit-Picpus convent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; returned old Fauchelevent. &ldquo;But to come to the point, how thedeuce did you manage to get in here, you, Father Madeleine? No matter ifyou are a saint; you are a man as well, and no man enters here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You certainly are here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no one but me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, &ldquo;I must stay here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, good God!&rdquo; cried Fauchelevent.</p><p>Jean Valjean drew near to the old man, and said to him in a grave voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father Fauchelevent, I saved your life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was the first to recall it,&rdquo; returned Fauchelevent.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you can do to-day for me that which I did for you in the oldendays.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent took in his aged, trembling, and wrinkled hands JeanValjean&rsquo;s two robust hands, and stood for several minutes as thoughincapable of speaking. At length he exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! that would be a blessing from the good God, if I could make you somelittle return for that! Save your life! Monsieur le Maire, dispose of theold man!&rdquo;</p><p>A wonderful joy had transfigured this old man. His countenance seemed toemit a ray of light.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you wish me to do?&rdquo; he resumed.</p><p>&ldquo;That I will explain to you. You have a chamber?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have an isolated hovel yonder, behind the ruins of the old convent, ina corner which no one ever looks into. There are three rooms in it.&rdquo;</p><p>The hut was, in fact, so well hidden behind the ruins, and so cleverlyarranged to prevent it being seen, that Jean Valjean had not perceived it.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean. &ldquo;Now I am going to ask two things of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are they, Mr. Mayor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the first place, you are not to tell any one what you know about me.In the second, you are not to try to find out anything more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As you please. I know that you can do nothing that is not honest, thatyou have always been a man after the good God&rsquo;s heart. And then, moreover,you it was who placed me here. That concerns you. I am at your service.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is settled then. Now, come with me. We will go and get the child.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Fauchelevent, &ldquo;so there is a child?&rdquo;</p><p>He added not a word further, and followed Jean Valjean as a dog followshis master.</p><p>Less than half an hour afterwards Cosette, who had grown rosy again beforethe flame of a good fire, was lying asleep in the old gardener&rsquo;s bed. JeanValjean had put on his cravat and coat once more; his hat, which he hadflung over the wall, had been found and picked up. While Jean Valjean wasputting on his coat, Fauchelevent had removed the bell and kneecap, whichnow hung on a nail beside a vintage basket that adorned the wall. The twomen were warming themselves with their elbows resting on a table uponwhich Fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese, black bread, a bottle ofwine, and two glasses, and the old man was saying to Jean Valjean, as helaid his hand on the latter&rsquo;s knee: &ldquo;Ah! Father Madeleine! You did notrecognize me immediately; you save people&rsquo;s lives, and then you forgetthem! That is bad! But they remember you! You are an ingrate!&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0118" id="link2HCH0118"></a>CHAPTER X&mdash;WHICH EXPLAINS HOW JAVERT GOT ON THE SCENT</h3><p>The events of which we have just beheld the reverse side, so to speak, hadcome about in the simplest possible manner.</p><p>When Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert had arrestedhim beside Fantine&rsquo;s death-bed, had escaped from the town jail of M. surM., the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to Paris. Paris isa maelstrom where everything is lost, and everything disappears in thisbelly of the world, as in the belly of the sea. No forest hides a man asdoes that crowd. Fugitives of every sort know this. They go to Paris as toan abyss; there are gulfs which save. The police know it also, and it isin Paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere. They sought theex-mayor of M. sur M. Javert was summoned to Paris to throw light on theirresearches. Javert had, in fact, rendered powerful assistance in therecapture of Jean Valjean. Javert&rsquo;s zeal and intelligence on that occasionhad been remarked by M. Chabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture underComte Anglès. M. Chabouillet, who had, moreover, already been Javert&rsquo;spatron, had the inspector of M. sur M. attached to the police force ofParis. There Javert rendered himself useful in divers and, though the wordmay seem strange for such services, honorable manners.</p><p>He no longer thought of Jean Valjean,&mdash;the wolf of to-day causesthese dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday,&mdash;when,in December, 1823, he read a newspaper, he who never read newspapers; butJavert, a monarchical man, had a desire to know the particulars of thetriumphal entry of the &ldquo;Prince Generalissimo&rdquo; into Bayonne. Just as he wasfinishing the article, which interested him; a name, the name of JeanValjean, attracted his attention at the bottom of a page. The paperannounced that the convict Jean Valjean was dead, and published the factin such formal terms that Javert did not doubt it. He confined himself tothe remark, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good entry.&rdquo; Then he threw aside the paper, andthought no more about it.</p><p>Some time afterwards, it chanced that a police report was transmitted fromthe prefecture of the Seine-et-Oise to the prefecture of police in Paris,concerning the abduction of a child, which had taken place, under peculiarcircumstances, as it was said, in the commune of Montfermeil. A littlegirl of seven or eight years of age, the report said, who had beenintrusted by her mother to an inn-keeper of that neighborhood, had beenstolen by a stranger; this child answered to the name of Cosette, and wasthe daughter of a girl named Fantine, who had died in the hospital, it wasnot known where or when.</p><p>This report came under Javert&rsquo;s eye and set him to thinking.</p><p>The name of Fantine was well known to him. He remembered that Jean Valjeanhad made him, Javert, burst into laughter, by asking him for a respite ofthree days, for the purpose of going to fetch that creature&rsquo;s child. Herecalled the fact that Jean Valjean had been arrested in Paris at the verymoment when he was stepping into the coach for Montfermeil. Some signs hadmade him suspect at the time that this was the second occasion of hisentering that coach, and that he had already, on the previous day, made anexcursion to the neighborhood of that village, for he had not been seen inthe village itself. What had he been intending to do in that region ofMontfermeil? It could not even be surmised. Javert understood it now.Fantine&rsquo;s daughter was there. Jean Valjean was going there in search ofher. And now this child had been stolen by a stranger! Who could thatstranger be? Could it be Jean Valjean? But Jean Valjean was dead. Javert,without saying anything to anybody, took the coach from the <i>PewterPlatter</i>, Cul-de-Sac de la Planchette, and made a trip to Montfermeil.</p><p>He expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there; he found agreat deal of obscurity.</p><p>For the first few days the Thénardiers had chattered in their rage. Thedisappearance of the Lark had created a sensation in the village. Heimmediately obtained numerous versions of the story, which ended in theabduction of a child. Hence the police report. But their first vexationhaving passed off, Thénardier, with his wonderful instinct, had veryquickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up the prosecutorof the Crown, and that his complaints with regard to the <i>abduction</i>of Cosette would have as their first result to fix upon himself, and uponmany dark affairs which he had on hand, the glittering eye of justice. Thelast thing that owls desire is to have a candle brought to them. And inthe first place, how explain the fifteen hundred francs which he hadreceived? He turned squarely round, put a gag on his wife&rsquo;s mouth, andfeigned astonishment when the <i>stolen child</i> was mentioned to him. Heunderstood nothing about it; no doubt he had grumbled for awhile at havingthat dear little creature &ldquo;taken from him&rdquo; so hastily; he should haveliked to keep her two or three days longer, out of tenderness; but her&ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; had come for her in the most natural way in the world. Headded the &ldquo;grandfather,&rdquo; which produced a good effect. This was the storythat Javert hit upon when he arrived at Montfermeil. The grandfathercaused Jean Valjean to vanish.</p><p>Nevertheless, Javert dropped a few questions, like plummets, intoThénardier&rsquo;s history. &ldquo;Who was that grandfather? and what was his name?&rdquo; Thénardier replied with simplicity: &ldquo;He is a wealthy farmer. I saw hispassport. I think his name was M. Guillaume Lambert.&rdquo;</p><p>Lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name. Thereupon Javertreturned to Paris.</p><p>&ldquo;Jean Valjean is certainly dead,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I am a ninny.&rdquo;</p><p>He had again begun to forget this history, when, in the course of March,1824, he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish ofSaint-Médard and who had been surnamed &ldquo;the mendicant who gives alms.&rdquo; This person, the story ran, was a man of means, whose name no one knewexactly, and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years, who knewnothing about herself, save that she had come from Montfermeil.Montfermeil! that name was always coming up, and it made Javert prick uphis ears. An old beggar police spy, an ex-beadle, to whom this person hadgiven alms, added a few more details. This gentleman of property was veryshy,&mdash;never coming out except in the evening, speaking to no one,except, occasionally to the poor, and never allowing any one to approachhim. He wore a horrible old yellow frock-coat, which was worth manymillions, being all wadded with bank-bills. This piqued Javert&rsquo;s curiosityin a decided manner. In order to get a close look at this fantasticgentleman without alarming him, he borrowed the beadle&rsquo;s outfit for a day,and the place where the old spy was in the habit of crouching everyevening, whining orisons through his nose, and playing the spy under coverof prayer.</p><p>&ldquo;The suspected individual&rdquo; did indeed approach Javert thus disguised, andbestow alms on him. At that moment Javert raised his head, and the shockwhich Jean Valjean received on recognizing Javert was equal to the onereceived by Javert when he thought he recognized Jean Valjean.</p><p>However, the darkness might have misled him; Jean Valjean&rsquo;s death wasofficial; Javert cherished very grave doubts; and when in doubt, Javert,the man of scruples, never laid a finger on any one&rsquo;s collar.</p><p>He followed his man to the Gorbeau house, and got &ldquo;the old woman&rdquo; totalking, which was no difficult matter. The old woman confirmed the factregarding the coat lined with millions, and narrated to him the episode ofthe thousand-franc bill. She had seen it! She had handled it! Javert hireda room; that evening he installed himself in it. He came and listened atthe mysterious lodger&rsquo;s door, hoping to catch the sound of his voice, butJean Valjean saw his candle through the key-hole, and foiled the spy bykeeping silent.</p><p>On the following day Jean Valjean decamped; but the noise made by the fallof the five-franc piece was noticed by the old woman, who, hearing therattling of coin, suspected that he might be intending to leave, and madehaste to warn Javert. At night, when Jean Valjean came out, Javert waswaiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men.</p><p>Javert had demanded assistance at the Prefecture, but he had not mentionedthe name of the individual whom he hoped to seize; that was his secret,and he had kept it for three reasons: in the first place, because theslightest indiscretion might put Jean Valjean on the alert; next, because,to lay hands on an ex-convict who had made his escape and was reputeddead, on a criminal whom justice had formerly classed forever as <i>amongmalefactors of the most dangerous sort</i>, was a magnificent successwhich the old members of the Parisian police would assuredly not leave toa newcomer like Javert, and he was afraid of being deprived of hisconvict; and lastly, because Javert, being an artist, had a taste for theunforeseen. He hated those well-heralded successes which are talked oflong in advance and have had the bloom brushed off. He preferred toelaborate his masterpieces in the dark and to unveil them suddenly at thelast.</p><p>Javert had followed Jean Valjean from tree to tree, then from corner tocorner of the street, and had not lost sight of him for a single instant;even at the moments when Jean Valjean believed himself to be the mostsecure Javert&rsquo;s eye had been on him. Why had not Javert arrested JeanValjean? Because he was still in doubt.</p><p>It must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely atits ease; the free press embarrassed it; several arbitrary arrestsdenounced by the newspapers, had echoed even as far as the Chambers, andhad rendered the Prefecture timid. Interference with individual libertywas a grave matter. The police agents were afraid of making a mistake; theprefect laid the blame on them; a mistake meant dismissal. The reader canimagine the effect which this brief paragraph, reproduced by twentynewspapers, would have caused in Paris: &ldquo;Yesterday, an aged grandfather,with white hair, a respectable and well-to-do gentleman, who was walkingwith his grandchild, aged eight, was arrested and conducted to the agencyof the Prefecture as an escaped convict!&rdquo;</p><p>Let us repeat in addition that Javert had scruples of his own; injunctionsof his conscience were added to the injunctions of the prefect. He wasreally in doubt.</p><p>Jean Valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark.</p><p>Sadness, uneasiness, anxiety, depression, this fresh misfortune of beingforced to flee by night, to seek a chance refuge in Paris for Cosette andhimself, the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of the child&mdash;allthis, without his being aware of it, had altered Jean Valjean&rsquo;s walk, andimpressed on his bearing such senility, that the police themselves,incarnate in the person of Javert, might, and did in fact, make a mistake.The impossibility of approaching too close, his costume of an <i>émigré</i>preceptor, the declaration of Thénardier which made a grandfather of him,and, finally, the belief in his death in prison, added still further tothe uncertainty which gathered thick in Javert&rsquo;s mind.</p><p>For an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his papers;but if the man was not Jean Valjean, and if this man was not a good,honest old fellow living on his income, he was probably some merry bladedeeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of Parisian misdeeds,some chief of a dangerous band, who gave alms to conceal his othertalents, which was an old dodge. He had trusty fellows, accomplices&rsquo;retreats in case of emergencies, in which he would, no doubt, take refuge.All these turns which he was making through the streets seemed to indicatethat he was not a simple and honest man. To arrest him too hastily wouldbe &ldquo;to kill the hen that laid the golden eggs.&rdquo; Where was theinconvenience in waiting? Javert was very sure that he would not escape.</p><p>Thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind, putting tohimself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage.</p><p>It was only quite late in the Rue de Pontoise, that, thanks to thebrilliant light thrown from a dram-shop, he decidedly recognized JeanValjean.</p><p>There are in this world two beings who give a profound start,&mdash;themother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his prey. Javertgave that profound start.</p><p>As soon as he had positively recognized Jean Valjean, the formidableconvict, he perceived that there were only three of them, and he asked forreinforcements at the police station of the Rue de Pontoise. One puts ongloves before grasping a thorn cudgel.</p><p>This delay and the halt at the Carrefour Rollin to consult with his agentscame near causing him to lose the trail. He speedily divined, however,that Jean Valjean would want to put the river between his pursuers andhimself. He bent his head and reflected like a blood-hound who puts hisnose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right scent. Javert,with his powerful rectitude of instinct, went straight to the bridge ofAusterlitz. A word with the toll-keeper furnished him with the informationwhich he required: &ldquo;Have you seen a man with a little girl?&rdquo; &ldquo;I made himpay two sous,&rdquo; replied the toll-keeper. Javert reached the bridge inseason to see Jean Valjean traverse the small illuminated spot on theother side of the water, leading Cosette by the hand. He saw him enter theRue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; he remembered the Cul-de-Sac Genrotarranged there like a trap, and of the sole exit of the Rue Droit-Mur intothe Rue Petit-Picpus. <i>He made sure of his back burrows</i>, as huntsmensay; he hastily despatched one of his agents, by a roundabout way, toguard that issue. A patrol which was returning to the Arsenal post havingpassed him, he made a requisition on it, and caused it to accompany him.In such games soldiers are aces. Moreover, the principle is, that in orderto get the best of a wild boar, one must employ the science of venery andplenty of dogs. These combinations having been effected, feeling that JeanValjean was caught between the blind alley Genrot on the right, his agenton the left, and himself, Javert, in the rear, he took a pinch of snuff.</p><p>Then he began the game. He experienced one ecstatic and infernal moment;he allowed his man to go on ahead, knowing that he had him safe, butdesirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible, happy atthe thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free, gloating overhim with his gaze, with that voluptuousness of the spider which allows thefly to flutter, and of the cat which lets the mouse run. Claws and talonspossess a monstrous sensuality,&mdash;the obscure movements of thecreature imprisoned in their pincers. What a delight this strangling is!</p><p>Javert was enjoying himself. The meshes of his net were stoutly knotted.He was sure of success; all he had to do now was to close his hand.</p><p>Accompanied as he was, the very idea of resistance was impossible, howevervigorous, energetic, and desperate Jean Valjean might be.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0018" id="linkimage-0018"></a><img src="images/2b5-10-javert-on-the-hunt.jpg" alt="Javert on the Hunt" width="100%" /></div><p>Javert advanced slowly, sounding, searching on his way all the nooks ofthe street like so many pockets of thieves.</p><p>When he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there.</p><p>His exasperation can be imagined.</p><p>He interrogated his sentinel of the Rues Droit-Mur and Petit-Picpus; thatagent, who had remained imperturbably at his post, had not seen the manpass.</p><p>It sometimes happens that a stag is lost head and horns; that is to say,he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels, and then the oldesthuntsmen know not what to say. Duvivier, Ligniville, and Desprez haltshort. In a discomfiture of this sort, Artonge exclaims, &ldquo;It was not astag, but a sorcerer.&rdquo; Javert would have liked to utter the same cry.</p><p>His disappointment bordered for a moment on despair and rage.</p><p>It is certain that Napoleon made mistakes during the war with Russia, thatAlexander committed blunders in the war in India, that Cæsar made mistakesin the war in Africa, that Cyrus was at fault in the war in Scythia, andthat Javert blundered in this campaign against Jean Valjean. He was wrong,perhaps, in hesitating in his recognition of the exconvict. The firstglance should have sufficed him. He was wrong in not arresting him purelyand simply in the old building; he was wrong in not arresting him when hepositively recognized him in the Rue de Pontoise. He was wrong in takingcounsel with his auxiliaries in the full light of the moon in theCarrefour Rollin. Advice is certainly useful; it is a good thing to knowand to interrogate those of the dogs who deserve confidence; but thehunter cannot be too cautious when he is chasing uneasy animals like thewolf and the convict. Javert, by taking too much thought as to how heshould set the bloodhounds of the pack on the trail, alarmed the beast bygiving him wind of the dart, and so made him run. Above all, he was wrongin that after he had picked up the scent again on the bridge ofAusterlitz, he played that formidable and puerile game of keeping such aman at the end of a thread. He thought himself stronger than he was, andbelieved that he could play at the game of the mouse and the lion. At thesame time, he reckoned himself as too weak, when he judged it necessary toobtain reinforcement. Fatal precaution, waste of precious time! Javertcommitted all these blunders, and nonetheless was one of the cleverestand most correct spies that ever existed. He was, in the full force of theterm, what is called in venery a <i>knowing dog</i>. But what is therethat is perfect?</p><p>Great strategists have their eclipses.</p><p>The greatest follies are often composed, like the largest ropes, of amultitude of strands. Take the cable thread by thread, take all the pettydetermining motives separately, and you can break them one after theother, and you say, &ldquo;That is all there is of it!&rdquo; Braid them, twist themtogether; the result is enormous: it is Attila hesitating between Marcianon the east and Valentinian on the west; it is Hannibal tarrying at Capua;it is Danton falling asleep at Arcis-sur-Aube.</p><p>However that may be, even at the moment when he saw that Jean Valjean hadescaped him, Javert did not lose his head. Sure that the convict who hadbroken his ban could not be far off, he established sentinels, heorganized traps and ambuscades, and beat the quarter all that night. Thefirst thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose rope hadbeen cut. A precious sign which, however, led him astray, since it causedhim to turn all his researches in the direction of the Cul-de-Sac Genrot.In this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted ongardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of waste land. JeanValjean evidently must have fled in that direction. The fact is, that hadhe penetrated a little further in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot, he would probablyhave done so and have been lost. Javert explored these gardens and thesewaste stretches as though he had been hunting for a needle.</p><p>At daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook, and returned tothe Prefecture of Police, as much ashamed as a police spy who had beencaptured by a robber might have been.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0137" id="link2H_4_0137"></a>BOOK SIXTH&mdash;LE PETIT-PICPUS</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0119" id="link2HCH0119"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;NUMBER 62 RUE PETIT-PICPUS</h3><p>Nothing, half a century ago, more resembled every other carriage gate thanthe carriage gate of Number 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. This entrance, whichusually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion, permitted a view of twothings, neither of which have anything very funereal about them,&mdash;acourtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines, and the face of a loungingporter. Above the wall, at the bottom of the court, tall trees werevisible. When a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard, when a glass ofwine cheered up the porter, it was difficult to pass Number 62 LittlePicpus Street without carrying away a smiling impression of it.Nevertheless, it was a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse.</p><p>The threshold smiled; the house prayed and wept.</p><p>If one succeeded in passing the porter, which was not easy,&mdash;whichwas even nearly impossible for every one, for there was an <i>open sesame!</i>which it was necessary to know,&mdash;if, the porter once passed, oneentered a little vestibule on the right, on which opened a staircase shutin between two walls and so narrow that only one person could ascend it ata time, if one did not allow one&rsquo;s self to be alarmed by a daubing ofcanary yellow, with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase, ifone ventured to ascend it, one crossed a first landing, then a second, andarrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash and thechocolate-hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency. Staircaseand corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows. The corridor took aturn and became dark. If one doubled this cape, one arrived a few pacesfurther on, in front of a door which was all the more mysterious becauseit was not fastened. If one opened it, one found one&rsquo;s self in a littlechamber about six feet square, tiled, well-scrubbed, clean, cold, and hungwith nankin paper with green flowers, at fifteen sous the roll. A white,dull light fell from a large window, with tiny panes, on the left, whichusurped the whole width of the room. One gazed about, but saw no one; onelistened, one heard neither a footstep nor a human murmur. The walls werebare, the chamber was not furnished; there was not even a chair.</p><p>One looked again, and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangularhole, about a foot square, with a grating of interlacing iron bars, black,knotted, solid, which formed squares&mdash;I had almost said meshes&mdash;ofless than an inch and a half in diagonal length. The little green flowersof the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those iron bars,without being startled or thrown into confusion by their funereal contact.Supposing that a living being had been so wonderfully thin as to essay anentrance or an exit through the square hole, this grating would haveprevented it. It did not allow the passage of the body, but it did allowthe passage of the eyes; that is to say, of the mind. This seems to haveoccurred to them, for it had been re-enforced by a sheet of tin insertedin the wall a little in the rear, and pierced with a thousand holes moremicroscopic than the holes of a strainer. At the bottom of this plate, anaperture had been pierced exactly similar to the orifice of a letter box.A bit of tape attached to a bell-wire hung at the right of the gratedopening.</p><p>If the tape was pulled, a bell rang, and one heard a voice very near athand, which made one start.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; the voice demanded.</p><p>It was a woman&rsquo;s voice, a gentle voice, so gentle that it was mournful.</p><p>Here, again, there was a magical word which it was necessary to know. Ifone did not know it, the voice ceased, the wall became silent once more,as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on the otherside of it.</p><p>If one knew the password, the voice resumed, &ldquo;Enter on the right.&rdquo;</p><p>One then perceived on the right, facing the window, a glass doorsurmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray. On raising the latch andcrossing the threshold, one experienced precisely the same impression aswhen one enters at the theatre into a grated <i>baignoire</i>, before thegrating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted. One was, in fact, in asort of theatre-box, narrow, furnished with two old chairs, and amuch-frayed straw matting, sparely illuminated by the vague light from theglass door; a regular box, with its front just of a height to lean upon,bearing a tablet of black wood. This box was grated, only the grating ofit was not of gilded wood, as at the opera; it was a monstrous lattice ofiron bars, hideously interlaced and riveted to the wall by enormousfastenings which resembled clenched fists.</p><p>The first minutes passed; when one&rsquo;s eyes began to grow used to thiscellar-like half-twilight, one tried to pass the grating, but got nofurther than six inches beyond it. There he encountered a barrier of blackshutters, re-enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood painteda gingerbread yellow. These shutters were divided into long, narrow slats,and they masked the entire length of the grating. They were always closed.At the expiration of a few moments one heard a voice proceeding frombehind these shutters, and saying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am here. What do you wish with me?&rdquo;</p><p>It was a beloved, sometimes an adored, voice. No one was visible. Hardlythe sound of a breath was audible. It seemed as though it were a spiritwhich had been evoked, that was speaking to you across the walls of thetomb.</p><p>If one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare conditions,the slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you; the evoked spiritbecame an apparition. Behind the grating, behind the shutter, oneperceived so far as the grating permitted sight, a head, of which only themouth and the chin were visible; the rest was covered with a black veil.One caught a glimpse of a black guimpe, and a form that was barelydefined, covered with a black shroud. That head spoke with you, but didnot look at you and never smiled at you.</p><p>The light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner thatyou saw her in the white, and she saw you in the black. This light wassymbolical.</p><p>Nevertheless, your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which wasmade in that place shut off from all glances. A profound vaguenessenveloped that form clad in mourning. Your eyes searched that vagueness,and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition. At theexpiration of a very short time you discovered that you could see nothing.What you beheld was night, emptiness, shadows, a wintry mist mingled witha vapor from the tomb, a sort of terrible peace, a silence from which youcould gather nothing, not even sighs, a gloom in which you coulddistinguish nothing, not even phantoms.</p><p>What you beheld was the interior of a cloister.</p><p>It was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called theConvent of the Bernardines of the Perpetual Adoration. The box in whichyou stood was the parlor. The first voice which had addressed you was thatof the portress who always sat motionless and silent, on the other side ofthe wall, near the square opening, screened by the iron grating and theplate with its thousand holes, as by a double visor. The obscurity whichbathed the grated box arose from the fact that the parlor, which had awindow on the side of the world, had none on the side of the convent.Profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place.</p><p>Nevertheless, there was something beyond that shadow; there was a light;there was life in the midst of that death. Although this was the moststrictly walled of all convents, we shall endeavor to make our way intoit, and to take the reader in, and to say, without transgressing theproper bounds, things which story-tellers have never seen, and have,therefore, never described.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0120" id="link2HCH0120"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE OBEDIENCE OF MARTIN VERGA</h3><p>This convent, which in 1824 had already existed for many a long year inthe Rue Petit-Picpus, was a community of Bernardines of the obedience ofMartin Verga.</p><p>These Bernardines were attached, in consequence, not to Clairvaux, likethe Bernardine monks, but to Cîteaux, like the Benedictine monks. In otherwords, they were the subjects, not of Saint Bernard, but of Saint Benoît.</p><p>Any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that MartinVerga founded in 1425 a congregation of Bernardines-Benedictines, withSalamanca for the head of the order, and Alcala as the branchestablishment.</p><p>This congregation had sent out branches throughout all the Catholiccountries of Europe.</p><p>There is nothing unusual in the Latin Church in these grafts of one orderon another. To mention only a single order of Saint-Benoît, which is herein question: there are attached to this order, without counting theobedience of Martin Verga, four congregations,&mdash;two in Italy,Mont-Cassin and Sainte-Justine of Padua; two in France, Cluny andSaint-Maur; and nine orders,&mdash;Vallombrosa, Granmont, the Célestins,the Camaldules, the Carthusians, the Humiliés, the Olivateurs, theSilvestrins, and lastly, Cîteaux; for Cîteaux itself, a trunk for otherorders, is only an offshoot of Saint-Benoît. Cîteaux dates from SaintRobert, Abbé de Molesme, in the diocese of Langres, in 1098. Now it was in529 that the devil, having retired to the desert of Subiaco&mdash;he wasold&mdash;had he turned hermit?&mdash;was chased from the ancient templeof Apollo, where he dwelt, by Saint-Benoît, then aged seventeen.</p><p>After the rule of the Carmelites, who go barefoot, wear a bit of willow ontheir throats, and never sit down, the harshest rule is that of theBernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga. They are clothed in black, witha guimpe, which, in accordance with the express command of Saint-Benoît,mounts to the chin. A robe of serge with large sleeves, a large woollenveil, the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square on the breast, theband which descends over their brow to their eyes,&mdash;this is theirdress. All is black except the band, which is white. The novices wear thesame habit, but all in white. The professed nuns also wear a rosary attheir side.</p><p>The Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga practise the PerpetualAdoration, like the Benedictines called Ladies of the Holy Sacrament, who,at the beginning of this century, had two houses in Paris,&mdash;one atthe Temple, the other in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève. However, theBernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus, of whom we are speaking,were a totally different order from the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,cloistered in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève and at the Temple. There werenumerous differences in their rule; there were some in their costume. TheBernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus wore the black guimpe, andthe Benedictines of the Holy Sacrament and of the RueNeuve-Sainte-Geneviève wore a white one, and had, besides, on theirbreasts, a Holy Sacrament about three inches long, in silver gilt orgilded copper. The nuns of the Petit-Picpus did not wear this HolySacrament. The Perpetual Adoration, which was common to the house of thePetit-Picpus and to the house of the Temple, leaves those two ordersperfectly distinct. Their only resemblance lies in this practice of theLadies of the Holy Sacrament and the Bernardines of Martin Verga, just asthere existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of all themysteries relating to the infancy, the life, and death of Jesus Christ andthe Virgin, between the two orders, which were, nevertheless, widelyseparated, and on occasion even hostile. The Oratory of Italy, establishedat Florence by Philip de Neri, and the Oratory of France, established byPierre de Bérulle. The Oratory of France claimed the precedence, sincePhilip de Neri was only a saint, while Bérulle was a cardinal.</p><p>Let us return to the harsh Spanish rule of Martin Verga.</p><p>The Bernardines-Benedictines of this obedience fast all the year round,abstain from meat, fast in Lent and on many other days which are peculiarto them, rise from their first sleep, from one to three o&rsquo;clock in themorning, to read their breviary and chant matins, sleep in all seasonsbetween serge sheets and on straw, make no use of the bath, never light afire, scourge themselves every Friday, observe the rule of silence, speakto each other only during the recreation hours, which are very brief, andwear drugget chemises for six months in the year, from September 14th,which is the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, until Easter. These six monthsare a modification: the rule says all the year, but this drugget chemise,intolerable in the heat of summer, produced fevers and nervous spasms. Theuse of it had to be restricted. Even with this palliation, when the nunsput on this chemise on the 14th of September, they suffer from fever forthree or four days. Obedience, poverty, chastity, perseverance in theirseclusion,&mdash;these are their vows, which the rule greatly aggravates.</p><p>The prioress is elected for three years by the mothers, who are called <i>mèresvocales</i> because they have a voice in the chapter. A prioress can onlybe re-elected twice, which fixes the longest possible reign of a prioressat nine years.</p><p>They never see the officiating priest, who is always hidden from them by aserge curtain nine feet in height. During the sermon, when the preacher isin the chapel, they drop their veils over their faces. They must alwaysspeak low, walk with their eyes on the ground and their heads bowed. Oneman only is allowed to enter the convent,&mdash;the archbishop of thediocese.</p><p>There is really one other,&mdash;the gardener. But he is always an oldman, and, in order that he may always be alone in the garden, and that thenuns may be warned to avoid him, a bell is attached to his knee.</p><p>Their submission to the prioress is absolute and passive. It is thecanonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation. As at the voiceof Christ, <i>ut voci Christi</i>, at a gesture, at the first sign, <i>adnutum, ad primum signum</i>, immediately, with cheerfulness, withperseverance, with a certain blind obedience, <i>prompte, hilariter,perseveranter et cæca quadam obedientia</i>, as the file in the hand ofthe workman, <i>quasi limam in manibus fabri</i>, without power to read orto write without express permission, <i>legere vel scribere non addisceritsine expressa superioris licentia</i>.</p><p>Each one of them in turn makes what they call <i>reparation</i>. Thereparation is the prayer for all the sins, for all the faults, for all thedissensions, for all the violations, for all the iniquities, for all thecrimes committed on earth. For the space of twelve consecutive hours, fromfour o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon till four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, or fromfour o&rsquo;clock in the morning until four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, thesister who is making <i>reparation</i> remains on her knees on the stonebefore the Holy Sacrament, with hands clasped, a rope around her neck.When her fatigue becomes unendurable, she prostrates herself flat on herface against the earth, with her arms outstretched in the form of a cross;this is her only relief. In this attitude she prays for all the guilty inthe universe. This is great to sublimity.</p><p>As this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle, it iscalled without distinction, <i>to make reparation</i> or <i>to be at thepost</i>. The nuns even prefer, out of humility, this last expression,which contains an idea of torture and abasement.</p><p><i>To make reparation</i> is a function in which the whole soul isabsorbed. The sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderboltto fall directly behind her.</p><p>Besides this, there is always a sister kneeling before the Holy Sacrament.This station lasts an hour. They relieve each other like soldiers onguard. This is the Perpetual Adoration.</p><p>The prioresses and the mothers almost always bear names stamped withpeculiar solemnity, recalling, not the saints and martyrs, but moments inthe life of Jesus Christ: as Mother Nativity, Mother Conception, MotherPresentation, Mother Passion. But the names of saints are not interdicted.</p><p>When one sees them, one never sees anything but their mouths.</p><p>All their teeth are yellow. No tooth-brush ever entered that convent.Brushing one&rsquo;s teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the lossof one&rsquo;s soul.</p><p>They never say <i>my</i>. They possess nothing of their own, and they mustnot attach themselves to anything. They call everything <i>our</i>; thus:our veil, our chaplet; if they were speaking of their chemise, they wouldsay <i>our chemise</i>. Sometimes they grow attached to some petty object,&mdash;toa book of hours, a relic, a medal that has been blessed. As soon as theybecome aware that they are growing attached to this object, they must giveit up. They recall the words of Saint Thérèse, to whom a great lady said,as she was on the point of entering her order, &ldquo;Permit me, mother, to sendfor a Bible to which I am greatly attached.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, you are attached tosomething! In that case, do not enter our order!&rdquo;</p><p>Every person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up, to have <i>a placeof her own, a chamber</i>. They live with their cells open. When theymeet, one says, &ldquo;Blessed and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of thealtar!&rdquo; The other responds, &ldquo;Forever.&rdquo; The same ceremony when one taps atthe other&rsquo;s door. Hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice on theother side is heard to say hastily, &ldquo;Forever!&rdquo; Like all practices, thisbecomes mechanical by force of habit; and one sometimes says <i>forever</i>before the other has had time to say the rather long sentence, &ldquo;Praisedand adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar.&rdquo;</p><p>Among the Visitandines the one who enters says: &ldquo;Ave Maria,&rdquo; and the onewhose cell is entered says, &ldquo;Gratia plena.&rdquo; It is their way of saying goodday, which is in fact full of grace.</p><p>At each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the churchbell of the convent. At this signal prioress, vocal mothers, professednuns, lay-sisters, novices, postulants, interrupt what they are saying,what they are doing, or what they are thinking, and all say in unison ifit is five o&rsquo;clock, for instance, &ldquo;At five o&rsquo;clock and at all hourspraised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!&rdquo; If it iseight o&rsquo;clock, &ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock and at all hours!&rdquo; and so on, accordingto the hour.</p><p>This custom, the object of which is to break the thread of thought and tolead it back constantly to God, exists in many communities; the formulaalone varies. Thus at The Infant Jesus they say, &ldquo;At this hour and atevery hour may the love of Jesus kindle my heart!&rdquo; TheBernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga, cloistered fifty years ago atPetit-Picpus, chant the offices to a solemn psalmody, a pure Gregorianchant, and always with full voice during the whole course of the office.Everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause, and say in alow voice, &ldquo;Jesus-Marie-Joseph.&rdquo; For the office of the dead they adopt atone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a depth.The effect produced is striking and tragic.</p><p>The nuns of the Petit-Picpus had made a vault under their grand altar forthe burial of their community. <i>The Government</i>, as they say, doesnot permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent whenthey die. This is an affliction to them, and causes them consternation asan infraction of the rules.</p><p>They had obtained a mediocre consolation at best,&mdash;permission to beinterred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancientVaugirard cemetery, which was made of land which had formerly belonged totheir community.</p><p>On Fridays the nuns hear high mass, vespers, and all the offices, as onSunday. They scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivalsunknown to people of the world, of which the Church of France was soprodigal in the olden days, and of which it is still prodigal in Spain andItaly. Their stations in the chapel are interminable. As for the numberand duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of them than byquoting the ingenuous remark of one of them: &ldquo;The prayers of thepostulants are frightful, the prayers of the novices are still worse, andthe prayers of the professed nuns are still worse.&rdquo;</p><p>Once a week the chapter assembles: the prioress presides; the vocalmothers assist. Each sister kneels in turn on the stones, and confessesaloud, in the presence of all, the faults and sins which she has committedduring the week. The vocal mothers consult after each confession andinflict the penance aloud.</p><p>Besides this confession in a loud tone, for which all faults in the leastserious are reserved, they have for their venial offences what they callthe <i>coulpe. To make one&rsquo;s coulpe</i> means to prostrate one&rsquo;s self flaton one&rsquo;s face during the office in front of the prioress until the latter,who is never called anything but <i>our mother</i>, notifies the culpritby a slight tap of her foot against the wood of her stall that she canrise. The <i>coulpe</i> or <i>peccavi</i>, is made for a very small matter&mdash;abroken glass, a torn veil, an involuntary delay of a few seconds at anoffice, a false note in church, etc.; this suffices, and the <i>coulpe</i>is made. The <i>coulpe</i> is entirely spontaneous; it is the culpableperson herself (the word is etymologically in its place here) who judgesherself and inflicts it on herself. On festival days and Sundays fourmother precentors intone the offices before a large reading-desk with fourplaces. One day one of the mother precentors intoned a psalm beginningwith <i>Ecce</i>, and instead of <i>Ecce</i> she uttered aloud the threenotes <i>do si sol</i>; for this piece of absent-mindedness she underwenta <i>coulpe</i> which lasted during the whole service: what rendered thefault enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed.</p><p>When a nun is summoned to the parlor, even were it the prioress herself,she drops her veil, as will be remembered, so that only her mouth isvisible.</p><p>The prioress alone can hold communication with strangers. The others cansee only their immediate family, and that very rarely. If, by chance, anoutsider presents herself to see a nun, or one whom she has known andloved in the outer world, a regular series of negotiations is required. Ifit is a woman, the authorization may sometimes be granted; the nun comes,and they talk to her through the shutters, which are opened only for amother or sister. It is unnecessary to say that permission is alwaysrefused to men.</p><p>Such is the rule of Saint-Benoît, aggravated by Martin Verga.</p><p>These nuns are not gay, rosy, and fresh, as the daughters of other ordersoften are. They are pale and grave. Between 1825 and 1830 three of themwent mad.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0121" id="link2HCH0121"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;AUSTERITIES</h3><p>One is a postulant for two years at least, often for four; a novice forfour. It is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced earlier thanthe age of twenty-three or twenty-four years. The Bernardines-Benedictinesof Martin Verga do not admit widows to their order.</p><p>In their cells, they deliver themselves up to many unknown macerations, ofwhich they must never speak.</p><p>On the day when a novice makes her profession, she is dressed in herhandsomest attire, she is crowned with white roses, her hair is brusheduntil it shines, and curled. Then she prostrates herself; a great blackveil is thrown over her, and the office for the dead is sung. Then thenuns separate into two files; one file passes close to her, saying inplaintive accents, &ldquo;Our sister is dead&rdquo;; and the other file responds in avoice of ecstasy, &ldquo;Our sister is alive in Jesus Christ!&rdquo;</p><p>At the epoch when this story takes place, a boarding-school was attachedto the convent&mdash;a boarding-school for young girls of noble and mostlywealthy families, among whom could be remarked Mademoiselle deSaint-Aulaire and de Bélissen, and an English girl bearing the illustriousCatholic name of Talbot. These young girls, reared by these nuns betweenfour walls, grew up with a horror of the world and of the age. One of themsaid to us one day, &ldquo;The sight of the street pavement made me shudder fromhead to foot.&rdquo; They were dressed in blue, with a white cap and a HolySpirit of silver gilt or of copper on their breast. On certain grandfestival days, particularly Saint Martha&rsquo;s day, they were permitted, as ahigh favor and a supreme happiness, to dress themselves as nuns and tocarry out the offices and practice of Saint-Benoît for a whole day. In theearly days the nuns were in the habit of lending them their blackgarments. This seemed profane, and the prioress forbade it. Only thenovices were permitted to lend. It is remarkable that these performances,tolerated and encouraged, no doubt, in the convent out of a secret spiritof proselytism and in order to give these children a foretaste of the holyhabit, were a genuine happiness and a real recreation for the scholars.They simply amused themselves with it. <i>It was new; it gave them achange</i>. Candid reasons of childhood, which do not, however, succeed inmaking us worldlings comprehend the felicity of holding a holy watersprinkler in one&rsquo;s hand and standing for hours together singing hardenough for four in front of a reading-desk.</p><p>The pupils conformed, with the exception of the austerities, to all thepractices of the convent. There was a certain young woman who entered theworld, and who after many years of married life had not succeeded inbreaking herself of the habit of saying in great haste whenever any oneknocked at her door, &ldquo;forever!&rdquo; Like the nuns, the pupils saw theirrelatives only in the parlor. Their very mothers did not obtain permissionto embrace them. The following illustrates to what a degree severity onthat point was carried. One day a young girl received a visit from hermother, who was accompanied by a little sister three years of age. Theyoung girl wept, for she wished greatly to embrace her sister. Impossible.She begged that, at least, the child might be permitted to pass her littlehand through the bars so that she could kiss it. This was almostindignantly refused.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0122" id="link2HCH0122"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;GAYETIES</h3><p>Nonetheless, these young girls filled this grave house with charmingsouvenirs.</p><p>At certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister. The recreation hourstruck. A door swung on its hinges. The birds said, &ldquo;Good; here come thechildren!&rdquo; An irruption of youth inundated that garden intersected with across like a shroud. Radiant faces, white foreheads, innocent eyes, fullof merry light, all sorts of auroras, were scattered about amid theseshadows. After the psalmodies, the bells, the peals, and knells andoffices, the sound of these little girls burst forth on a sudden moresweetly than the noise of bees. The hive of joy was opened, and each onebrought her honey. They played, they called to each other, they formedinto groups, they ran about; pretty little white teeth chattered in thecorners; the veils superintended the laughs from a distance, shades keptwatch of the sunbeams, but what mattered it? Still they beamed andlaughed. Those four lugubrious walls had their moment of dazzlingbrilliancy. They looked on, vaguely blanched with the reflection of somuch joy at this sweet swarming of the hives. It was like a shower ofroses falling athwart this house of mourning. The young girls frolickedbeneath the eyes of the nuns; the gaze of impeccability does not embarrassinnocence. Thanks to these children, there was, among so many austerehours, one hour of ingenuousness. The little ones skipped about; the elderones danced. In this cloister play was mingled with heaven. Nothing is sodelightful and so august as all these fresh, expanding young souls. Homerwould have come thither to laugh with Perrault; and there was in thatblack garden, youth, health, noise, cries, giddiness, pleasure, happinessenough to smooth out the wrinkles of all their ancestresses, those of theepic as well as those of the fairy-tale, those of the throne as well asthose of the thatched cottage from Hecuba to la Mère-Grand.</p><p>In that house more than anywhere else, perhaps, arise those children&rsquo;ssayings which are so graceful and which evoke a smile that is full ofthoughtfulness. It was between those four gloomy walls that a child offive years exclaimed one day: &ldquo;Mother! one of the big girls has just toldme that I have only nine years and ten months longer to remain here. Whathappiness!&rdquo;</p><p>It was here, too, that this memorable dialogue took place:&mdash;</p><p><i>A Vocal Mother</i>. Why are you weeping, my child?</p><p><i>The child</i> (aged six). I told Alix that I knew my French history.She says that I do not know it, but I do.</p><p><i>Alix</i>, the big girl (aged nine). No; she does not know it.</p><p><i>The Mother</i>. How is that, my child?</p><p><i>Alix</i>. She told me to open the book at random and to ask her anyquestion in the book, and she would answer it.</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She did not answer it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us see about it. What did you ask her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I opened the book at random, as she proposed, and I put the firstquestion that I came across.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what was the question?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was, &lsquo;What happened after that?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>It was there that that profound remark was made anent a rather greedyparoquet which belonged to a lady boarder:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;How well bred! it eats the top of the slice of bread and butter just likea person!&rdquo;</p><p>It was on one of the flagstones of this cloister that there was oncepicked up a confession which had been written out in advance, in orderthat she might not forget it, by a sinner of seven years:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father, I accuse myself of having been avaricious.</p><p>&ldquo;Father, I accuse myself of having been an adulteress.</p><p>&ldquo;Father, I accuse myself of having raised my eyes to the gentlemen.&rdquo;</p><p>It was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy mouth sixyears of age improvised the following tale, which was listened to by blueeyes aged four and five years:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There were three little cocks who owned a country where there were agreat many flowers. They plucked the flowers and put them in theirpockets. After that they plucked the leaves and put them in theirplaythings. There was a wolf in that country; there was a great deal offorest; and the wolf was in the forest; and he ate the little cocks.&rdquo;</p><p>And this other poem:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There came a blow with a stick.</p><p>&ldquo;It was Punchinello who bestowed it on the cat.</p><p>&ldquo;It was not good for her; it hurt her.</p><p>&ldquo;Then a lady put Punchinello in prison.&rdquo;</p><p>It was there that a little abandoned child, a foundling whom the conventwas bringing up out of charity, uttered this sweet and heart-breakingsaying. She heard the others talking of their mothers, and she murmured inher corner:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;As for me, my mother was not there when I was born!&rdquo;</p><p>There was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying through thecorridors with her bunch of keys, and whose name was Sister Agatha. The <i>bigbig girls</i>&mdash;those over ten years of age&mdash;called her <i>Agathocles</i>.</p><p>The refectory, a large apartment of an oblong square form, which receivedno light except through a vaulted cloister on a level with the garden, wasdark and damp, and, as the children say, full of beasts. All the placesround about furnished their contingent of insects.</p><p>Each of its four corners had received, in the language of the pupils, aspecial and expressive name. There was Spider corner, Caterpillar corner,Wood-louse corner, and Cricket corner.</p><p>Cricket corner was near the kitchen and was highly esteemed. It was not socold there as elsewhere. From the refectory the names had passed to theboarding-school, and there served as in the old College Mazarin todistinguish four nations. Every pupil belonged to one of these fournations according to the corner of the refectory in which she sat atmeals. One day Monseigneur the Archbishop while making his pastoral visitsaw a pretty little rosy girl with beautiful golden hair enter theclass-room through which he was passing.</p><p>He inquired of another pupil, a charming brunette with rosy cheeks, whostood near him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is a spider, Monseigneur.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bah! And that one yonder?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is a cricket.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is a caterpillar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really! and yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am a wood-louse, Monseigneur.&rdquo;</p><p>Every house of this sort has its own peculiarities. At the beginning ofthis century Écouen was one of those strict and graceful places whereyoung girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is almost august. AtÉcouen, in order to take rank in the procession of the Holy Sacrament, adistinction was made between virgins and florists. There were also the&ldquo;dais&rdquo; and the &ldquo;censors,&rdquo;&mdash;the first who held the cords of the dais,and the others who carried incense before the Holy Sacrament. The flowersbelonged by right to the florists. Four &ldquo;virgins&rdquo; walked in advance. Onthe morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear the questionput in the dormitory, &ldquo;Who is a virgin?&rdquo;</p><p>Madame Campan used to quote this saying of a &ldquo;little one&rdquo; of seven years,to a &ldquo;big girl&rdquo; of sixteen, who took the head of the procession, whileshe, the little one, remained at the rear, &ldquo;You are a virgin, but I amnot.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0123" id="link2HCH0123"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;DISTRACTIONS</h3><p>Above the door of the refectory this prayer, which was called the <i>whitePaternoster</i>, and which possessed the property of bearing people straightto paradise, was inscribed in large black letters:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Little white Paternoster, which God made, which God said, which Godplaced in paradise. In the evening, when I went to bed, I found threeangels sitting on my bed, one at the foot, two at the head, the goodVirgin Mary in the middle, who told me to lie down without hesitation. Thegood God is my father, the good Virgin is my mother, the three apostlesare my brothers, the three virgins are my sisters. The shirt in which Godwas born envelopes my body; Saint Margaret&rsquo;s cross is written on mybreast. Madame the Virgin was walking through the meadows, weeping forGod, when she met M. Saint John. &lsquo;Monsieur Saint John, whence come you?&rsquo;‘I come from <i>Ave Salus</i>.&rsquo; &lsquo;You have not seen the good God; where ishe?&rsquo; &lsquo;He is on the tree of the Cross, his feet hanging, his hands nailed,a little cap of white thorns on his head.&rsquo; Whoever shall say this thriceat eventide, thrice in the morning, shall win paradise at the last.&rdquo;</p><p>In 1827 this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall under atriple coating of daubing paint. At the present time it is finallydisappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then, andwho are old women now.</p><p>A large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of thisrefectory, whose only door, as we think we have mentioned, opened on thegarden. Two narrow tables, each flanked by two wooden benches, formed twolong parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory. The wallswere white, the tables were black; these two mourning colors constitutethe only variety in convents. The meals were plain, and the food of thechildren themselves severe. A single dish of meat and vegetables combined,or salt fish&mdash;such was their luxury. This meagre fare, which wasreserved for the pupils alone, was, nevertheless, an exception. Thechildren ate in silence, under the eye of the mother whose turn it was,who, if a fly took a notion to fly or to hum against the rule, opened andshut a wooden book from time to time. This silence was seasoned with thelives of the saints, read aloud from a little pulpit with a desk, whichwas situated at the foot of the crucifix. The reader was one of the biggirls, in weekly turn. At regular distances, on the bare tables, therewere large, varnished bowls in which the pupils washed their own silvercups and knives and forks, and into which they sometimes threw some scrapof tough meat or spoiled fish; this was punished. These bowls were called<i>ronds d&rsquo;eau</i>. The child who broke the silence &ldquo;made a cross with hertongue.&rdquo; Where? On the ground. She licked the pavement. The dust, that endof all joys, was charged with the chastisement of those poor littlerose-leaves which had been guilty of chirping.</p><p>There was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as a<i>unique copy</i>, and which it is forbidden to read. It is the rule ofSaint-Benoît. An arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate. <i>Nemoregulas, seu constitutiones nostras, externis communicabit</i>.</p><p>The pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book, and setto reading it with avidity, a reading which was often interrupted by thefear of being caught, which caused them to close the volume precipitately.</p><p>From the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very moderateamount of pleasure. The most &ldquo;interesting thing&rdquo; they found were someunintelligible pages about the sins of young boys.</p><p>They played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabbyfruit-trees. In spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of thepunishments administered, when the wind had shaken the trees, theysometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or aninhabited pear on the sly. I will now cede the privilege of speech to aletter which lies before me, a letter written five and twenty years ago byan old pupil, now Madame la Duchesse de &mdash;&mdash;, one of the mostelegant women in Paris. I quote literally: &ldquo;One hides one&rsquo;s pear or one&rsquo;sapple as best one may. When one goes upstairs to put the veil on the bedbefore supper, one stuffs them under one&rsquo;s pillow and at night one eatsthem in bed, and when one cannot do that, one eats them in the closet.&rdquo; That was one of their greatest luxuries.</p><p>Once&mdash;it was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to theconvent&mdash;one of the young girls, Mademoiselle Bouchard, who wasconnected with the Montmorency family, laid a wager that she would ask fora day&rsquo;s leave of absence&mdash;an enormity in so austere a community. Thewager was accepted, but not one of those who bet believed that she woulddo it. When the moment came, as the archbishop was passing in front of thepupils, Mademoiselle Bouchard, to the indescribable terror of hercompanions, stepped out of the ranks, and said, &ldquo;Monseigneur, a day&rsquo;sleave of absence.&rdquo; Mademoiselle Bouchard was tall, blooming, with theprettiest little rosy face in the world. M. de Quélen smiled and said,&ldquo;What, my dear child, a day&rsquo;s leave of absence! Three days if you like. Igrant you three days.&rdquo; The prioress could do nothing; the archbishop hadspoken. Horror of the convent, but joy of the pupil. The effect may beimagined.</p><p>This stern cloister was not so well walled off, however, but that the lifeof the passions of the outside world, drama, and even romance, did notmake their way in. To prove this, we will confine ourselves to recordinghere and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact, which,however, bears no reference in itself to, and is not connected by anythread whatever with the story which we are relating. We mention the factfor the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in the reader&rsquo;smind.</p><p>About this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was not anun, who was treated with great respect, and who was addressed as <i>MadameAlbertine</i>. Nothing was known about her, save that she was mad, andthat in the world she passed for dead. Beneath this history it was saidthere lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great marriage.</p><p>This woman, hardly thirty years of age, of dark complexion and tolerablypretty, had a vague look in her large black eyes. Could she see? There wassome doubt about this. She glided rather than walked, she never spoke; itwas not quite known whether she breathed. Her nostrils were livid andpinched as after yielding up their last sigh. To touch her hand was liketouching snow. She possessed a strange spectral grace. Wherever sheentered, people felt cold. One day a sister, on seeing her pass, said toanother sister, &ldquo;She passes for a dead woman.&rdquo; &ldquo;Perhaps she is one,&rdquo; replied the other.</p><p>A hundred tales were told of Madame Albertine. This arose from the eternalcuriosity of the pupils. In the chapel there was a gallery called <i>L&rsquo;Œilde Bœuf</i>. It was in this gallery, which had only a circular bay,an <i>œil de bœuf</i>, that Madame Albertine listened to theoffices. She always occupied it alone because this gallery, being on thelevel of the first story, the preacher or the officiating priest could beseen, which was interdicted to the nuns. One day the pulpit was occupiedby a young priest of high rank, M. Le Duc de Rohan, peer of France,officer of the Red Musketeers in 1815 when he was Prince de Léon, and whodied afterward, in 1830, as cardinal and Archbishop of Besançon. It wasthe first time that M. de Rohan had preached at the Petit-Picpus convent.Madame Albertine usually preserved perfect calmness and completeimmobility during the sermons and services. That day, as soon as shecaught sight of M. de Rohan, she half rose, and said, in a loud voice,amid the silence of the chapel, &ldquo;Ah! Auguste!&rdquo; The whole community turnedtheir heads in amazement, the preacher raised his eyes, but MadameAlbertine had relapsed into her immobility. A breath from the outer world,a flash of life, had passed for an instant across that cold and lifelessface and had then vanished, and the mad woman had become a corpse again.</p><p>Those two words, however, had set every one in the convent who had theprivilege of speech to chattering. How many things were contained in that&ldquo;Ah! Auguste!&rdquo; what revelations! M. de Rohan&rsquo;s name really was Auguste. Itwas evident that Madame Albertine belonged to the very highest society,since she knew M. de Rohan, and that her own rank there was of thehighest, since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a lord, and thatthere existed between them some connection, of relationship, perhaps, buta very close one in any case, since she knew his &ldquo;pet name.&rdquo;</p><p>Two very severe duchesses, Mesdames de Choiseul and de Sérent, oftenvisited the community, whither they penetrated, no doubt, in virtue of theprivilege <i>Magnates mulieres</i>, and caused great consternation in theboarding-school. When these two old ladies passed by, all the poor younggirls trembled and dropped their eyes.</p><p>Moreover, M. de Rohan, quite unknown to himself, was an object ofattention to the school-girls. At that epoch he had just been made, whilewaiting for the episcopate, vicar-general of the Archbishop of Paris. Itwas one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate the offices inthe chapel of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus. Not one of the young reclusescould see him, because of the serge curtain, but he had a sweet and rathershrill voice, which they had come to know and to distinguish. He had beena mousquetaire, and then, he was said to be very coquettish, that hishandsome brown hair was very well dressed in a roll around his head, andthat he had a broad girdle of magnificent moire, and that his blackcassock was of the most elegant cut in the world. He held a great place inall these imaginations of sixteen years.</p><p>Not a sound from without made its way into the convent. But there was oneyear when the sound of a flute penetrated thither. This was an event, andthe girls who were at school there at the time still recall it.</p><p>It was a flute which was played in the neighborhood. This flute alwaysplayed the same air, an air which is very far away nowadays,&mdash;&ldquo;MyZétulbé, come reign o&rsquo;er my soul,&rdquo;&mdash;and it was heard two or threetimes a day. The young girls passed hours in listening to it, the vocalmothers were upset by it, brains were busy, punishments descended inshowers. This lasted for several months. The girls were all more or lessin love with the unknown musician. Each one dreamed that she was Zétulbé.The sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the Rue Droit-Mur;and they would have given anything, compromised everything, attemptedanything for the sake of seeing, of catching a glance, if only for asecond, of the &ldquo;young man&rdquo; who played that flute so deliciously, and who,no doubt, played on all these souls at the same time. There were some whomade their escape by a back door, and ascended to the third story on theRue Droit-Mur side, in order to attempt to catch a glimpse through thegaps. Impossible! One even went so far as to thrust her arm through thegrating, and to wave her white handkerchief. Two were still bolder. Theyfound means to climb on a roof, and risked their lives there, andsucceeded at last in seeing &ldquo;the young man.&rdquo; He was an old <i>émigré</i>gentleman, blind and penniless, who was playing his flute in his attic, inorder to pass the time.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0124" id="link2HCH0124"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE LITTLE CONVENT</h3><p>In this enclosure of the Petit-Picpus there were three perfectly distinctbuildings,&mdash;the Great Convent, inhabited by the nuns, theBoarding-school, where the scholars were lodged; and lastly, what wascalled the Little Convent. It was a building with a garden, in which livedall sorts of aged nuns of various orders, the relics of cloistersdestroyed in the Revolution; a reunion of all the black, gray, and whitemedleys of all communities and all possible varieties; what might becalled, if such a coupling of words is permissible, a sort of harlequinconvent.</p><p>When the Empire was established, all these poor old dispersed and exiledwomen had been accorded permission to come and take shelter under thewings of the Bernardines-Benedictines. The government paid them a smallpension, the ladies of the Petit-Picpus received them cordially. It was asingular pell-mell. Each followed her own rule. Sometimes the pupils ofthe boarding-school were allowed, as a great recreation, to pay them avisit; the result is, that all those young memories have retained amongother souvenirs that of Mother Sainte-Bazile, Mother Sainte-Scolastique,and Mother Jacob.</p><p>One of these refugees found herself almost at home. She was a nun ofSainte-Aure, the only one of her order who had survived. The ancientconvent of the ladies of Sainte-Aure occupied, at the beginning of theeighteenth century, this very house of the Petit-Picpus, which belongedlater to the Benedictines of Martin Verga. This holy woman, too poor towear the magnificent habit of her order, which was a white robe with ascarlet scapulary, had piously put it on a little manikin, which sheexhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at herdeath. In 1824, only one nun of this order remained; to-day, there remainsonly a doll.</p><p>In addition to these worthy mothers, some old society women had obtainedpermission of the prioress, like Madame Albertine, to retire into theLittle Convent. Among the number were Madame Beaufort d&rsquo;Hautpoul andMarquise Dufresne. Another was never known in the convent except by theformidable noise which she made when she blew her nose. The pupils calledher Madame Vacarmini (hubbub).</p><p>About 1820 or 1821, Madame de Genlis, who was at that time editing alittle periodical publication called <i>l&rsquo;Intrépide</i>, asked to beallowed to enter the convent of the Petit-Picpus as lady resident. The Ducd&rsquo;Orléans recommended her. Uproar in the hive; the vocal-mothers were allin a flutter; Madame de Genlis had made romances. But she declared thatshe was the first to detest them, and then, she had reached her fiercestage of devotion. With the aid of God, and of the Prince, she entered.She departed at the end of six or eight months, alleging as a reason, thatthere was no shade in the garden. The nuns were delighted. Although veryold, she still played the harp, and did it very well.</p><p>When she went away she left her mark in her cell. Madame de Genlis wassuperstitious and a Latinist. These two words furnish a tolerably goodprofile of her. A few years ago, there were still to be seen, pasted inthe inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up hersilverware and her jewels, these five lines in Latin, written with her ownhand in red ink on yellow paper, and which, in her opinion, possessed theproperty of frightening away robbers:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Imparibus meritis pendent tria corpora ramis:<br/>Dismas et Gesmas, media est divina potestas;<br/>Alta petit Dismas, infelix, infima, Gesmas;<br/>Nos et res nostras conservet summa potestas.<br/>Hos versus dicas, ne tu furto tua perdas.<a href="#linknote-15" name="linknoteref-15" id="linknoteref-15">15</a></p><p>These verses in sixth century Latin raise the question whether the twothieves of Calvary were named, as is commonly believed, Dismas and Gestas,or Dismas and Gesmas. This orthography might have confounded thepretensions put forward in the last century by the Vicomte de Gestas, of adescent from the wicked thief. However, the useful virtue attached tothese verses forms an article of faith in the order of the Hospitallers.</p><p>The church of the house, constructed in such a manner as to separate theGreat Convent from the Boarding-school like a veritable intrenchment, was,of course, common to the Boarding-school, the Great Convent, and theLittle Convent. The public was even admitted by a sort of lazarettoentrance on the street. But all was so arranged, that none of theinhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside world.Suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand, and folded insuch a manner as to form, not, as in ordinary churches, a prolongationbehind the altar, but a sort of hall, or obscure cellar, to the right ofthe officiating priest; suppose this hall to be shut off by a curtainseven feet in height, of which we have already spoken; in the shadow ofthat curtain, pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the choir on the left,the school-girls on the right, the lay-sisters and the novices at thebottom, and you will have some idea of the nuns of the Petit-Picpusassisting at divine service. That cavern, which was called the choir,communicated with the cloister by a lobby. The church was lighted from thegarden. When the nuns were present at services where their rule enjoinedsilence, the public was warned of their presence only by the folding seatsof the stalls noisily rising and falling.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0125" id="link2HCH0125"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;SOME SILHOUETTES OF THIS DARKNESS</h3><p>During the six years which separate 1819 from 1825, the prioress of thePetit-Picpus was Mademoiselle de Blemeur, whose name, in religion, wasMother Innocente. She came of the family of Marguerite de Blemeur, authorof <i>Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint-Benoît</i>. She had beenre-elected. She was a woman about sixty years of age, short, thick,&ldquo;singing like a cracked pot,&rdquo; says the letter which we have alreadyquoted; an excellent woman, moreover, and the only merry one in the wholeconvent, and for that reason adored. She was learned, erudite, wise,competent, curiously proficient in history, crammed with Latin, stuffedwith Greek, full of Hebrew, and more of a Benedictine monk than aBenedictine nun.</p><p>The sub-prioress was an old Spanish nun, Mother Cineres, who was almostblind.</p><p>The most esteemed among the vocal mothers were Mother Sainte-Honorine; thetreasurer, Mother Sainte-Gertrude, the chief mistress of the novices;Mother-Saint-Ange, the assistant mistress; Mother Annonciation, thesacristan; Mother Saint-Augustin, the nurse, the only one in the conventwho was malicious; then Mother Sainte-Mechtilde (Mademoiselle Gauvain),very young and with a beautiful voice; Mother des Anges (MademoiselleDrouet), who had been in the convent of the Filles-Dieu, and in theconvent du Trésor, between Gisors and Magny; Mother Saint-Joseph(Mademoiselle de Cogolludo), Mother Sainte-Adélaide (Mademoiselled&rsquo;Auverney), Mother Miséricorde (Mademoiselle de Cifuentes, who could notresist austerities), Mother Compassion (Mademoiselle de la Miltière,received at the age of sixty in defiance of the rule, and very wealthy);Mother Providence (Mademoiselle de Laudinière), Mother Présentation(Mademoiselle de Siguenza), who was prioress in 1847; and finally, MotherSainte-Céligne (sister of the sculptor Ceracchi), who went mad; MotherSainte-Chantal (Mademoiselle de Suzon), who went mad.</p><p>There was also, among the prettiest of them, a charming girl of three andtwenty, who was from the Isle de Bourbon, a descendant of the ChevalierRoze, whose name had been Mademoiselle Roze, and who was called MotherAssumption.</p><p>Mother Sainte-Mechtilde, intrusted with the singing and the choir, wasfond of making use of the pupils in this quarter. She usually took acomplete scale of them, that is to say, seven, from ten to sixteen yearsof age, inclusive, of assorted voices and sizes, whom she made singstanding, drawn up in a line, side by side, according to age, from thesmallest to the largest. This presented to the eye, something in thenature of a reed-pipe of young girls, a sort of living Pan-pipe made ofangels.</p><p>Those of the lay-sisters whom the scholars loved most were SisterEuphrasie, Sister Sainte-Marguérite, Sister Sainte-Marthe, who was in herdotage, and Sister Sainte-Michel, whose long nose made them laugh.</p><p>All these women were gentle with the children. The nuns were severe onlytowards themselves. No fire was lighted except in the school, and the foodwas choice compared to that in the convent. Moreover, they lavished athousand cares on their scholars. Only, when a child passed near a nun andaddressed her, the nun never replied.</p><p>This rule of silence had had this effect, that throughout the wholeconvent, speech had been withdrawn from human creatures, and bestowed oninanimate objects. Now it was the church-bell which spoke, now it was thegardener&rsquo;s bell. A very sonorous bell, placed beside the portress, andwhich was audible throughout the house, indicated by its varied peals,which formed a sort of acoustic telegraph, all the actions of materiallife which were to be performed, and summoned to the parlor, in case ofneed, such or such an inhabitant of the house. Each person and each thinghad its own peal. The prioress had one and one, the sub-prioress one andtwo. Six-five announced lessons, so that the pupils never said &ldquo;to go tolessons,&rdquo; but &ldquo;to go to six-five.&rdquo; Four-four was Madame de Genlis&rsquo;ssignal. It was very often heard. &ldquo;C&rsquo;est le diable a quatre,&rdquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;sthe very deuce&mdash;said the uncharitable. Tennine strokes announced agreat event. It was the opening of <i>the door of seclusion</i>, afrightful sheet of iron bristling with bolts which only turned on itshinges in the presence of the archbishop.</p><p>With the exception of the archbishop and the gardener, no man entered theconvent, as we have already said. The schoolgirls saw two others: one, thechaplain, the Abbé Banés, old and ugly, whom they were permitted tocontemplate in the choir, through a grating; the other the drawing-master,M. Ansiaux, whom the letter, of which we have perused a few lines, calls<i>M. Anciot</i>, and describes as <i>a frightful old hunchback</i>.</p><p>It will be seen that all these men were carefully chosen.</p><p>Such was this curious house.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0126" id="link2HCH0126"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;POST CORDA LAPIDES</h3><p>After having sketched its moral face, it will not prove unprofitable topoint out, in a few words, its material configuration. The reader alreadyhas some idea of it.</p><p>The convent of the Petit-Picpus-Sainte-Antoine filled almost the whole ofthe vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the RuePolonceau, the Rue Droit-Mur, the Rue Petit-Picpus, and the unused lane,called Rue Aumarais on old plans. These four streets surrounded thistrapezium like a moat. The convent was composed of several buildings and agarden. The principal building, taken in its entirety, was a juxtapositionof hybrid constructions which, viewed from a bird&rsquo;s-eye view, outlined,with considerable exactness, a gibbet laid flat on the ground. The mainarm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragment of the Rue Droit-Murcomprised between the Rue Petit-Picpus and the Rue Polonceau; the lesserarm was a lofty, gray, severe grated façade which faced the RuePetit-Picpus; the carriage entrance No. 62 marked its extremity. Towardsthe centre of this façade was a low, arched door, whitened with dust andashes, where the spiders wove their webs, and which was open only for anhour or two on Sundays, and on rare occasions, when the coffin of a nunleft the convent. This was the public entrance of the church. The elbow ofthe gibbet was a square hall which was used as the servants&rsquo; hall, andwhich the nuns called <i>the buttery</i>. In the main arm were the cellsof the mothers, the sisters, and the novices. In the lesser arm lay thekitchens, the refectory, backed up by the cloisters and the church.Between the door No. 62 and the corner of the closed Aumarais Lane, wasthe school, which was not visible from without. The remainder of thetrapezium formed the garden, which was much lower than the level of theRue Polonceau, which caused the walls to be very much higher on the insidethan on the outside. The garden, which was slightly arched, had in itscentre, on the summit of a hillock, a fine pointed and conical fir-tree,whence ran, as from the peaked boss of a shield, four grand alleys, and,ranged by twos in between the branchings of these, eight small ones, sothat, if the enclosure had been circular, the geometrical plan of thealleys would have resembled a cross superposed on a wheel. As the alleysall ended in the very irregular walls of the garden, they were of unequallength. They were bordered with currant bushes. At the bottom, an alley oftall poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent, which was at the angleof the Rue Droit-Mur to the house of the Little Convent, which was at theangle of the Aumarais Lane. In front of the Little Convent was what wascalled the little garden. To this whole, let the reader add a courtyard,all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings, prison walls,the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the RuePolonceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood, and he will be ableto form for himself a complete image of what the house of the Bernardinesof the Petit-Picpus was forty years ago. This holy house had been built onthe precise site of a famous tennis-ground of the fourteenth to thesixteenth century, which was called the &ldquo;tennis-ground of the eleventhousand devils.&rdquo;</p><p>All these streets, moreover, were more ancient than Paris. These names,Droit-Mur and Aumarais, are very ancient; the streets which bear them arevery much more ancient still. Aumarais Lane was called Maugout Lane; theRue Droit-Mur was called the Rue des Églantiers, for God opened flowersbefore man cut stones.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0127" id="link2HCH0127"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;A CENTURY UNDER A GUIMPE</h3><p>Since we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of thePetit-Picpus was in former times, and since we have ventured to open awindow on that discreet retreat, the reader will permit us one otherlittle digression, utterly foreign to this book, but characteristic anduseful, since it shows that the cloister even has its original figures.</p><p>In the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from the Abbey ofFontevrault. She had even been in society before the Revolution. Shetalked a great deal of M. de Miromesnil, Keeper of the Seals under LouisXVI. and of a Presidentess Duplat, with whom she had been very intimate.It was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on everypretext. She told wonders of the Abbey of Fontevrault,&mdash;that it waslike a city, and that there were streets in the monastery.</p><p>She talked with a Picard accent which amused the pupils. Every year, shesolemnly renewed her vows, and at the moment of taking the oath, she saidto the priest, &ldquo;Monseigneur Saint-François gave it to MonseigneurSaint-Julien, Monseigneur Saint-Julien gave it to MonseigneurSaint-Eusebius, Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius gave it to MonseigneurSaint-Procopius, etc., etc.; and thus I give it to you, father.&rdquo; And theschool-girls would begin to laugh, not in their sleeves, but under theirveils; charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown.</p><p>On another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories. She said that <i>inher youth the Bernardine monks were every whit as good as themousquetaires</i>. It was a century which spoke through her, but it wasthe eighteenth century. She told about the custom of the four wines, whichexisted before the Revolution in Champagne and Bourgogne. When a greatpersonage, a marshal of France, a prince, a duke, and a peer, traversed atown in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers came out to harangue himand presented him with four silver gondolas into which they had pouredfour different sorts of wine. On the first goblet this inscription couldbe read, <i>monkey wine</i>; on the second, <i>lion wine</i>; on thethird, <i>sheep wine</i>; on the fourth, <i>hog wine</i>. These fourlegends express the four stages descended by the drunkard; the first,intoxication, which enlivens; the second, that which irritates; the third,that which dulls; and the fourth, that which brutalizes.</p><p>In a cupboard, under lock and key, she kept a mysterious object of whichshe thought a great deal. The rule of Fontevrault did not forbid this. Shewould not show this object to anyone. She shut herself up, which her ruleallowed her to do, and hid herself, every time that she desired tocontemplate it. If she heard a footstep in the corridor, she closed thecupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands. As soonas it was mentioned to her, she became silent, she who was so fond oftalking. The most curious were baffled by her silence and the mosttenacious by her obstinacy. Thus it furnished a subject of comment for allthose who were unoccupied or bored in the convent. What could thattreasure of the centenarian be, which was so precious and so secret? Someholy book, no doubt? Some unique chaplet? Some authentic relic? They lostthemselves in conjectures. When the poor old woman died, they rushed toher cupboard more hastily than was fitting, perhaps, and opened it. Theyfound the object beneath a triple linen cloth, like some consecratedpaten. It was a Faenza platter representing little Loves flitting awaypursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous syringes. The chase aboundsin grimaces and in comical postures. One of the charming little Loves isalready fairly spitted. He is resisting, fluttering his tiny wings, andstill making an effort to fly, but the dancer is laughing with a satanicalair. Moral: Love conquered by the colic. This platter, which is verycurious, and which had, possibly, the honor of furnishing Molière with anidea, was still in existence in September, 1845; it was for sale by abric-à-brac merchant in the Boulevard Beaumarchais.</p><p>This good old woman would not receive any visits from outside <i>because</i>,said she, the <i>parlor is too gloomy</i>.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0128" id="link2HCH0128"></a>CHAPTER X&mdash;ORIGIN OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION</h3><p>However, this almost sepulchral parlor, of which we have sought to conveyan idea, is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with the sameseverity in other convents. At the convent of the Rue du Temple, inparticular, which belonged, in truth, to another order, the black shutterswere replaced by brown curtains, and the parlor itself was a salon with apolished wood floor, whose windows were draped in white muslin curtainsand whose walls admitted all sorts of frames, a portrait of a Benedictinenun with unveiled face, painted bouquets, and even the head of a Turk.</p><p>It is in that garden of the Temple convent, that stood that famouschestnut-tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest in France,and which bore the reputation among the good people of the eighteenthcentury of being <i>the father of all the chestnut trees of the realm</i>.</p><p>As we have said, this convent of the Temple was occupied by Benedictinesof the Perpetual Adoration, Benedictines quite different from those whodepended on Cîteaux. This order of the Perpetual Adoration is not veryancient and does not go back more than two hundred years. In 1649 the holysacrament was profaned on two occasions a few days apart, in two churchesin Paris, at Saint-Sulpice and at Saint-Jean en Grève, a rare andfrightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar. M. the Priorand Vicar-General of Saint-Germain des Prés ordered a solemn procession ofall his clergy, in which the Pope&rsquo;s Nuncio officiated. But this expiationdid not satisfy two sainted women, Madame Courtin, Marquise de Boucs, andthe Comtesse de Châteauvieux. This outrage committed on &ldquo;the most holysacrament of the altar,&rdquo; though but temporary, would not depart from theseholy souls, and it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated by a&ldquo;Perpetual Adoration&rdquo; in some female monastery. Both of them, one in 1652,the other in 1653, made donations of notable sums to Mother Catherine deBar, called of the Holy Sacrament, a Benedictine nun, for the purpose offounding, to this pious end, a monastery of the order of Saint-Benoît; thefirst permission for this foundation was given to Mother Catherine de Barby M. de Metz, Abbé of Saint-Germain, &ldquo;on condition that no woman could bereceived unless she contributed three hundred livres income, which amountsto six thousand livres, to the principal.&rdquo; After the Abbé ofSaint-Germain, the king accorded letters-patent; and all the rest,abbatial charter, and royal letters, was confirmed in 1654 by the Chamberof Accounts and the Parliament.</p><p>Such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of theBenedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Holy Sacrament at Paris.Their first convent was &ldquo;a new building&rdquo; in the Rue Cassette, out of thecontributions of Mesdames de Boucs and de Châteauvieux.</p><p>This order, as it will be seen, was not to be confounded with theBenedictine nuns of Cîteaux. It mounted back to the Abbé of Saint-Germaindes Prés, in the same manner that the ladies of the Sacred Heart go backto the general of the Jesuits, and the sisters of charity to the generalof the Lazarists.</p><p>It was also totally different from the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus,whose interior we have just shown. In 1657, Pope Alexander VII. hadauthorized, by a special brief, the Bernardines of the Rue Petit-Picpus,to practise the Perpetual Adoration like the Benedictine nuns of the HolySacrament. But the two orders remained distinct nonetheless.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0129" id="link2HCH0129"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;END OF THE PETIT-PICPUS</h3><p>At the beginning of the Restoration, the convent of the Petit-Picpus wasin its decay; this forms a part of the general death of the order, which,after the eighteenth century, has been disappearing like all the religiousorders. Contemplation is, like prayer, one of humanity&rsquo;s needs; but, likeeverything which the Revolution touched, it will be transformed, and frombeing hostile to social progress, it will become favorable to it.</p><p>The house of the Petit-Picpus was becoming rapidly depopulated. In 1840,the Little Convent had disappeared, the school had disappeared. There wereno longer any old women, nor young girls; the first were dead, the latterhad taken their departure. <i>Volaverunt</i>.</p><p>The rule of the Perpetual Adoration is so rigid in its nature that italarms, vocations recoil before it, the order receives no recruits. In1845, it still obtained lay-sisters here and there. But of professed nuns,none at all. Forty years ago, the nuns numbered nearly a hundred; fifteenyears ago there were not more than twenty-eight of them. How many arethere to-day? In 1847, the prioress was young, a sign that the circle ofchoice was restricted. She was not forty years old. In proportion as thenumber diminishes, the fatigue increases, the service of each becomes morepainful; the moment could then be seen drawing near when there would bebut a dozen bent and aching shoulders to bear the heavy rule ofSaint-Benoît. The burden is implacable, and remains the same for the fewas for the many. It weighs down, it crushes. Thus they die. At the periodwhen the author of this book still lived in Paris, two died. One wastwenty-five years old, the other twenty-three. This latter can say, likeJulia Alpinula: <i>&ldquo;Hic jaceo. Vixi annos viginti et tres.&rdquo; </i> It is inconsequence of this decay that the convent gave up the education of girls.</p><p>We have not felt able to pass before this extraordinary house withoutentering it, and without introducing the minds which accompany us, andwhich are listening to our tale, to the profit of some, perchance, of themelancholy history of Jean Valjean. We have penetrated into thiscommunity, full of those old practices which seem so novel to-day. It isthe closed garden, <i>hortus conclusus</i>. We have spoken of thissingular place in detail, but with respect, in so far, at least, as detailand respect are compatible. We do not understand all, but we insultnothing. We are equally far removed from the hosanna of Joseph de Maistre,who wound up by anointing the executioner, and from the sneer of Voltaire,who even goes so far as to ridicule the cross.</p><p>An illogical act on Voltaire&rsquo;s part, we may remark, by the way; forVoltaire would have defended Jesus as he defended Calas; and even forthose who deny superhuman incarnations, what does the crucifix represent?The assassinated sage.</p><p>In this nineteenth century, the religious idea is undergoing a crisis.People are unlearning certain things, and they do well, provided that,while unlearning them they learn this: There is no vacuum in the humanheart. Certain demolitions take place, and it is well that they do, but oncondition that they are followed by reconstructions.</p><p>In the meantime, let us study things which are no more. It is necessary toknow them, if only for the purpose of avoiding them. The counterfeits ofthe past assume false names, and gladly call themselves the future. Thisspectre, this past, is given to falsifying its own passport. Let us informourselves of the trap. Let us be on our guard. The past has a visage,superstition, and a mask, hypocrisy. Let us denounce the visage and let ustear off the mask.</p><p>As for convents, they present a complex problem,&mdash;a question ofcivilization, which condemns them; a question of liberty, which protectsthem.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0149" id="link2H_4_0149"></a>BOOK SEVENTH&mdash;PARENTHESIS</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0130" id="link2HCH0130"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE CONVENT AS AN ABSTRACT IDEA</h3><p>This book is a drama, whose leading personage is the Infinite.</p><p>Man is the second.</p><p>Such being the case, and a convent having happened to be on our road, ithas been our duty to enter it.

Monasteries, when they abound in a nation, are clogs in itscirculation, cumbrous establishments, centres of idleness where centres oflabor should exist. Monastic communities are to the great social communitywhat the mistletoe is to the oak, what the wart is to the human body.Their prosperity and their fatness mean the impoverishment of the country.The monastic regime, good at the beginning of civilization, useful in thereduction of the brutal by the spiritual, is bad when peoples have reachedtheir manhood. Moreover, when it becomes relaxed, and when it enters intoits period of disorder, it becomes bad for the very reasons which renderedit salutary in its period of purity, because it still continues to set theexample.</p><p>Claustration has had its day. Cloisters, useful in the early education ofmodern civilization, have embarrassed its growth, and are injurious to itsdevelopment. So far as institution and formation with relation to man areconcerned, monasteries, which were good in the tenth century, questionablein the fifteenth, are detestable in the nineteenth. The leprosy ofmonasticism has gnawed nearly to a skeleton two wonderful nations, Italyand Spain; the one the light, the other the splendor of Europe forcenturies; and, at the present day, these two illustrious peoples are butjust beginning to convalesce, thanks to the healthy and vigorous hygieneof 1789 alone.</p><p>The convent&mdash;the ancient female convent in particular, such as itstill presents itself on the threshold of this century, in Italy, inAustria, in Spain&mdash;is one of the most sombre concretions of theMiddle Ages. The cloister, that cloister, is the point of intersection ofhorrors. The Catholic cloister, properly speaking, is wholly filled withthe black radiance of death.</p><p>The Spanish convent is the most funereal of all. There rise, in obscurity,beneath vaults filled with gloom, beneath domes vague with shadow, massivealtars of Babel, as high as cathedrals; there immense white crucifixeshang from chains in the dark; there are extended, all nude on the ebony,great Christs of ivory; more than bleeding,&mdash;bloody; hideous andmagnificent, with their elbows displaying the bones, their knee-pansshowing their integuments, their wounds showing their flesh, crowned withsilver thorns, nailed with nails of gold, with blood drops of rubies ontheir brows, and diamond tears in their eyes. The diamonds and rubies seemwet, and make veiled beings in the shadow below weep, their sides bruisedwith the hair shirt and their iron-tipped scourges, their breasts crushedwith wicker hurdles, their knees excoriated with prayer; women who thinkthemselves wives, spectres who think themselves seraphim. Do these womenthink? No. Have they any will? No. Do they love? No. Do they live? No.Their nerves have turned to bone; their bones have turned to stone. Theirveil is of woven night. Their breath under their veil resembles theindescribably tragic respiration of death. The abbess, a spectre,sanctifies them and terrifies them. The immaculate one is there, and veryfierce. Such are the ancient monasteries of Spain. Liars of terribledevotion, caverns of virgins, ferocious places.</p><p>Catholic Spain is more Roman than Rome herself. The Spanish convent was,above all others, the Catholic convent. There was a flavor of the Orientabout it. The archbishop, the kislar-aga of heaven, locked up and keptwatch over this seraglio of souls reserved for God. The nun was theodalisque, the priest was the eunuch. The fervent were chosen in dreamsand possessed Christ. At night, the beautiful, nude young man descendedfrom the cross and became the ecstasy of the cloistered one. Lofty wallsguarded the mystic sultana, who had the crucified for her sultan, from allliving distraction. A glance on the outer world was infidelity. The <i>inpace</i> replaced the leather sack. That which was cast into the sea inthe East was thrown into the ground in the West. In both quarters, womenwrung their hands; the waves for the first, the grave for the last; herethe drowned, there the buried. Monstrous parallel.</p><p>To-day the upholders of the past, unable to deny these things, haveadopted the expedient of smiling at them. There has come into fashion astrange and easy manner of suppressing the revelations of history, ofinvalidating the commentaries of philosophy, of eliding all embarrassingfacts and all gloomy questions. <i>A matter for declamations</i>, say theclever. Declamations, repeat the foolish. Jean-Jacques a declaimer;Diderot a declaimer; Voltaire on Calas, Labarre, and Sirven, declaimers. Iknow not who has recently discovered that Tacitus was a declaimer, thatNero was a victim, and that pity is decidedly due to &ldquo;that poorHolofernes.&rdquo;</p><p>Facts, however, are awkward things to disconcert, and they are obstinate.The author of this book has seen, with his own eyes, eight leagues distantfrom Brussels,&mdash;there are relics of the Middle Ages there which areattainable for everybody,&mdash;at the Abbey of Villers, the hole of theoubliettes, in the middle of the field which was formerly the courtyard ofthe cloister, and on the banks of the Thil, four stone dungeons, halfunder ground, half under the water. They were <i>in pace</i>. Each ofthese dungeons has the remains of an iron door, a vault, and a gratedopening which, on the outside, is two feet above the level of the river,and on the inside, six feet above the level of the ground. Four feet ofriver flow past along the outside wall. The ground is always soaked. Theoccupant of the <i>in pace</i> had this wet soil for his bed. In one ofthese dungeons, there is a fragment of an iron necklet riveted to thewall; in another, there can be seen a square box made of four slabs ofgranite, too short for a person to lie down in, too low for him to standupright in. A human being was put inside, with a coverlid of stone on top.This exists. It can be seen. It can be touched. These <i>in pace</i>,these dungeons, these iron hinges, these necklets, that lofty peep-hole ona level with the river&rsquo;s current, that box of stone closed with a lid ofgranite like a tomb, with this difference, that the dead man here was aliving being, that soil which is but mud, that vault hole, those oozingwalls,&mdash;what declaimers!</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0132" id="link2HCH0132"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;ON WHAT CONDITIONS ONE CAN RESPECT THE PAST</h3><p>Monasticism, such as it existed in Spain, and such as it still exists inThibet, is a sort of phthisis for civilization. It stops life short. Itsimply depopulates. Claustration, castration. It has been the scourge ofEurope. Add to this the violence so often done to the conscience, theforced vocations, feudalism bolstered up by the cloister, the right of thefirst-born pouring the excess of the family into monasticism, theferocities of which we have just spoken, the <i>in pace</i>, the closedmouths, the walled-up brains, so many unfortunate minds placed in thedungeon of eternal vows, the taking of the habit, the interment of livingsouls. Add individual tortures to national degradations, and, whoever youmay be, you will shudder before the frock and the veil,&mdash;those twowinding-sheets of human devising. Nevertheless, at certain points and incertain places, in spite of philosophy, in spite of progress, the spiritof the cloister persists in the midst of the nineteenth century, and asingular ascetic recrudescence is, at this moment, astonishing thecivilized world. The obstinacy of antiquated institutions in perpetuatingthemselves resembles the stubbornness of the rancid perfume which shouldclaim our hair, the pretensions of the spoiled fish which should persistin being eaten, the persecution of the child&rsquo;s garment which should insiston clothing the man, the tenderness of corpses which should return toembrace the living.</p><p>&ldquo;Ingrates!&rdquo; says the garment, &ldquo;I protected you in inclement weather. Whywill you have nothing to do with me?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have just come from the deepsea,&rdquo; says the fish. &ldquo;I have been a rose,&rdquo; says the perfume. &ldquo;I have lovedyou,&rdquo; says the corpse. &ldquo;I have civilized you,&rdquo; says the convent.</p><p>To this there is but one reply: &ldquo;In former days.&rdquo;</p><p>To dream of the indefinite prolongation of defunct things, and of thegovernment of men by embalming, to restore dogmas in a bad condition, toregild shrines, to patch up cloisters, to rebless reliquaries, torefurnish superstitions, to revictual fanaticisms, to put new handles onholy water brushes and militarism, to reconstitute monasticism andmilitarism, to believe in the salvation of society by the multiplicationof parasites, to force the past on the present,&mdash;this seems strange.Still, there are theorists who hold such theories. These theorists, whoare in other respects people of intelligence, have a very simple process;they apply to the past a glazing which they call social order, divineright, morality, family, the respect of elders, antique authority, sacredtradition, legitimacy, religion; and they go about shouting, &ldquo;Look! takethis, honest people.&rdquo; This logic was known to the ancients. Thesoothsayers practise it. They rubbed a black heifer over with chalk, andsaid, &ldquo;She is white, <i>Bos cretatus</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>As for us, we respect the past here and there, and we spare it, above all,provided that it consents to be dead. If it insists on being alive, weattack it, and we try to kill it.</p><p>Superstitions, bigotries, affected devotion, prejudices, those forms, allforms as they are, are tenacious of life; they have teeth and nails intheir smoke, and they must be clasped close, body to body, and war must bemade on them, and that without truce; for it is one of the fatalities ofhumanity to be condemned to eternal combat with phantoms. It is difficultto seize darkness by the throat, and to hurl it to the earth.</p><p>A convent in France, in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century, is acollege of owls facing the light. A cloister, caught in the very act ofasceticism, in the very heart of the city of &rsquo;89 and of 1830 and of 1848,Rome blossoming out in Paris, is an anachronism. In ordinary times, inorder to dissolve an anachronism and to cause it to vanish, one has onlyto make it spell out the date. But we are not in ordinary times.</p><p>Let us fight.</p><p>Let us fight, but let us make a distinction. The peculiar property oftruth is never to commit excesses. What need has it of exaggeration? Thereis that which it is necessary to destroy, and there is that which it issimply necessary to elucidate and examine. What a force is kindly andserious examination! Let us not apply a flame where only a light isrequired.</p><p>So, given the nineteenth century, we are opposed, as a generalproposition, and among all peoples, in Asia as well as in Europe, in Indiaas well as in Turkey, to ascetic claustration. Whoever says cloister, saysmarsh. Their putrescence is evident, their stagnation is unhealthy, theirfermentation infects people with fever, and etiolates them; theirmultiplication becomes a plague of Egypt. We cannot think without affrightof those lands where fakirs, bonzes, santons, Greek monks, marabouts,talapoins, and dervishes multiply even like swarms of vermin.</p><p>This said, the religious question remains. This question has certainmysterious, almost formidable sides; may we be permitted to look at itfixedly.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0133" id="link2HCH0133"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE CONVENT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PRINCIPLES</h3><p>Men unite themselves and dwell in communities.

The Middle Ages cast aside, Asia cast aside, thehistorical and political question held in reserve, from the purelyphilosophical point of view, outside the requirements of militant policy,on condition that the monastery shall be absolutely a voluntary matter andshall contain only consenting parties, I shall always consider acloistered community with a certain attentive, and, in some respects, adeferential gravity.</p><p>Wherever there is a community, there is a commune; where there is acommune, there is right. The monastery is the product of the formula:Equality, Fraternity. Oh! how grand is liberty! And what a splendidtransfiguration! Liberty suffices to transform the monastery into arepublic.</p><p>Let us continue.</p><p>But these men, or these women who are behind these four walls. They dressthemselves in coarse woollen, they are equals, they call each otherbrothers, that is well; but they do something else?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>What?</p><p>They gaze on the darkness, they kneel, and they clasp their hands.</p><p>What does this signify?</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0134" id="link2HCH0134"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;PRAYER</h3><p>They pray.</p><p>To whom?</p><p>To God.</p><p>To pray to God,&mdash;what is the meaning of these words?</p><p>Is there an infinite beyond us? Is that infinite there, inherent,permanent; necessarily substantial, since it is infinite; and because, ifit lacked matter it would be bounded; necessarily intelligent, since it isinfinite, and because, if it lacked intelligence, it would end there? Doesthis infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can attribute toourselves only the idea of existence? In other terms, is it not theabsolute, of which we are only the relative?</p><p>At the same time that there is an infinite without us, is there not aninfinite within us? Are not these two infinites (what an alarming plural!)superposed, the one upon the other? Is not this second infinite, so tospeak, subjacent to the first? Is it not the latter&rsquo;s mirror, reflection,echo, an abyss which is concentric with another abyss? Is this secondinfinity intelligent also? Does it think? Does it love? Does it will? Ifthese two infinities are intelligent, each of them has a will principle,and there is an <i>I</i> in the upper infinity as there is an <i>I</i> inthe lower infinity. The <i>I</i> below is the soul; the <i>I</i> on highis God.</p><p>To place the infinity here below in contact, by the medium of thought,with the infinity on high, is called praying.</p><p>Let us take nothing from the human mind; to suppress is bad. We mustreform and transform. Certain faculties in man are directed towards theUnknown; thought, reverie, prayer. The Unknown is an ocean. What isconscience? It is the compass of the Unknown. Thought, reverie, prayer,&mdash;theseare great and mysterious radiations. Let us respect them. Whither go thesemajestic irradiations of the soul? Into the shadow; that is to say, to thelight.</p><p>The grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing and to deny nothing ofhumanity. Close to the right of the man, beside it, at the least, thereexists the right of the soul.</p><p>To crush fanaticism and to venerate the infinite, such is the law. Let usnot confine ourselves to prostrating ourselves before the tree ofcreation, and to the contemplation of its branches full of stars. We havea duty to labor over the human soul, to defend the mystery against themiracle, to adore the incomprehensible and reject the absurd, to admit, asan inexplicable fact, only what is necessary, to purify belief, to removesuperstitions from above religion; to clear God of caterpillars.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0135" id="link2HCH0135"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE ABSOLUTE GOODNESS OF PRAYER</h3><p>With regard to the modes of prayer, all are good, provided that they aresincere. Turn your book upside down and be in the infinite.</p><p>There is, as we know, a philosophy which denies the infinite. There isalso a philosophy, pathologically classified, which denies the sun; thisphilosophy is called blindness.</p><p>To erect a sense which we lack into a source of truth, is a fine blindman&rsquo;s self-sufficiency.</p><p>The curious thing is the haughty, superior, and compassionate airs whichthis groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy which beholds God.One fancies he hears a mole crying, &ldquo;I pity them with their sun!&rdquo;</p><p>There are, as we know, powerful and illustrious atheists. At bottom, ledback to the truth by their very force, they are not absolutely sure thatthey are atheists; it is with them only a question of definition, and inany case, if they do not believe in God, being great minds, they proveGod.</p><p>We salute them as philosophers, while inexorably denouncing theirphilosophy.</p><p>Let us go on.</p><p>The remarkable thing about it is, also, their facility in payingthemselves off with words. A metaphysical school of the North, impregnatedto some extent with fog, has fancied that it has worked a revolution inhuman understanding by replacing the word Force with the word Will.</p><p>To say: &ldquo;the plant wills,&rdquo; instead of: &ldquo;the plant grows&rdquo;: this would befecund in results, indeed, if we were to add: &ldquo;the universe wills.&rdquo; Why?Because it would come to this: the plant wills, therefore it has an <i>I</i>;the universe wills, therefore it has a God.</p><p>As for us, who, however, in contradistinction to this school, rejectnothing <i>a priori</i>, a will in the plant, accepted by this school,appears to us more difficult to admit than a will in the universe deniedby it.</p><p>To deny the will of the infinite, that is to say, God, is impossible onany other conditions than a denial of the infinite. We have demonstratedthis.</p><p>The negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism. Everythingbecomes &ldquo;a mental conception.&rdquo;</p><p>With nihilism, no discussion is possible; for the nihilist logic doubtsthe existence of its interlocutor, and is not quite sure that it existsitself.</p><p>From its point of view, it is possible that it may be for itself, only &ldquo;amental conception.&rdquo;</p><p>Only, it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits in thelump, simply by the utterance of the word, mind.</p><p>In short, no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes allend in the monosyllable, No.</p><p>To No there is only one reply, Yes.</p><p>Nihilism has no point.</p><p>There is no such thing as nothingness. Zero does not exist. Everything issomething. Nothing is nothing.</p><p>Man lives by affirmation even more than by bread.</p><p>Even to see and to show does not suffice. Philosophy should be an energy;it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the condition of man.Socrates should enter into Adam and produce Marcus Aurelius; in otherwords, the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the man offelicity. Eden should be changed into a Lyceum. Science should be acordial. To enjoy,&mdash;what a sad aim, and what a paltry ambition! Thebrute enjoys. To offer thought to the thirst of men, to give them all asan elixir the notion of God, to make conscience and science fraternize inthem, to render them just by this mysterious confrontation; such is thefunction of real philosophy. Morality is a blossoming out of truths.Contemplation leads to action. The absolute should be practicable. It isnecessary that the ideal should be breathable, drinkable, and eatable tothe human mind. It is the ideal which has the right to say: <i>Take, thisis my body, this is my blood</i>. Wisdom is holy communion. It is on thiscondition that it ceases to be a sterile love of science and becomes theone and sovereign mode of human rallying, and that philosophy herself ispromoted to religion.</p><p>Philosophy should not be a corbel erected on mystery to gaze upon it atits ease, without any other result than that of being convenient tocuriosity.</p><p>For our part, adjourning the development of our thought to anotheroccasion, we will confine ourselves to saying that we neither understandman as a point of departure nor progress as an end, without those twoforces which are their two motors: faith and love.</p><p>Progress is the goal, the ideal is the type.</p><p>What is this ideal? It is God.</p><p>Ideal, absolute, perfection, infinity: identical words.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0136" id="link2HCH0136"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN BLAME</h3><p>History and philosophy have eternal duties, which are, at the same time,simple duties; to combat Caiphas the High-priest, Draco the Lawgiver,Trimalcion the Legislator, Tiberius the Emperor; this is clear, direct,and limpid, and offers no obscurity.</p><p>But the right to live apart, even with its inconveniences and its abuses,insists on being stated and taken into account.

That hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle of thenight, was the nuns chanting matins; that hall, of which he had caught aglimpse in the gloom, was the chapel. That phantom which he had seenstretched on the ground was the sister who was making reparation; thatbell, the sound of which had so strangely surprised him, was thegardener&rsquo;s bell attached to the knee of Father Fauchelevent.</p><p>Cosette once put to bed, Jean Valjean and Fauchelevent had, as we havealready seen, supped on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before a good,crackling fire; then, the only bed in the hut being occupied by Cosette,each threw himself on a truss of straw.</p><p>Before he shut his eyes, Jean Valjean said: &ldquo;I must remain herehenceforth.&rdquo; This remark trotted through Fauchelevent&rsquo;s head all nightlong.</p><p>To tell the truth, neither of them slept.</p><p>Jean Valjean, feeling that he was discovered and that Javert was on hisscent, understood that he and Cosette were lost if they returned to Paris.Then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded him in thiscloister. Jean Valjean had, henceforth, but one thought,&mdash;to remainthere. Now, for an unfortunate man in his position, this convent was boththe safest and the most dangerous of places; the most dangerous, because,as no men might enter there, if he were discovered, it was a flagrantoffence, and Jean Valjean would find but one step intervening between theconvent and prison; the safest, because, if he could manage to get himselfaccepted there and remain there, who would ever seek him in such a place?To dwell in an impossible place was safety.</p><p>On his side, Fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains. He began by declaringto himself that he understood nothing of the matter. How had M. Madeleinegot there, when the walls were what they were? Cloister walls are not tobe stepped over. How did he get there with a child? One cannot scale aperpendicular wall with a child in one&rsquo;s arms. Who was that child? Wheredid they both come from? Since Fauchelevent had lived in the convent, hehad heard nothing of M. sur M., and he knew nothing of what had takenplace there. Father Madeleine had an air which discouraged questions; andbesides, Fauchelevent said to himself: &ldquo;One does not question a saint.&rdquo; M.Madeleine had preserved all his prestige in Fauchelevent&rsquo;s eyes. Only,from some words which Jean Valjean had let fall, the gardener thought hecould draw the inference that M. Madeleine had probably become bankruptthrough the hard times, and that he was pursued by his creditors; or thathe had compromised himself in some political affair, and was in hiding;which last did not displease Fauchelevent, who, like many of our peasantsof the North, had an old fund of Bonapartism about him. While in hiding,M. Madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge, and it was quite simplethat he should wish to remain there. But the inexplicable point, to whichFauchelevent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain, wasthat M. Madeleine should be there, and that he should have that littlegirl with him. Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to them, andstill did not believe it possible. The incomprehensible had just made itsentrance into Fauchelevent&rsquo;s hut. Fauchelevent groped about amidconjectures, and could see nothing clearly but this: &ldquo;M. Madeleine savedmy life.&rdquo; This certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course. Hesaid to himself: &ldquo;It is my turn now.&rdquo; He added in his conscience: &ldquo;M.Madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrustinghimself under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out.&rdquo; He made up hismind to save M. Madeleine.</p><p>Nevertheless, he put many questions to himself and made himself diversreplies: &ldquo;After what he did for me, would I save him if he were a thief?Just the same. If he were an assassin, would I save him? Just the same.Since he is a saint, shall I save him? Just the same.&rdquo;</p><p>But what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent!Fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimericalundertaking; this poor peasant of Picardy without any other ladder thanhis self-devotion, his good will, and a little of that old rustic cunning,on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous enterprise,undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister, and the steepescarpments of the rule of Saint-Benoît. Father Fauchelevent was an oldman who had been an egoist all his life, and who, towards the end of hisdays, halt, infirm, with no interest left to him in the world, found itsweet to be grateful, and perceiving a generous action to be performed,flung himself upon it like a man, who at the moment when he is dying,should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he had nevertasted, and should swallow it with avidity. We may add, that the air whichhe had breathed for many years in this convent had destroyed allpersonality in him, and had ended by rendering a good action of some kindabsolutely necessary to him.</p><p>So he took his resolve: to devote himself to M. Madeleine.</p><p>We have just called him a <i>poor peasant of Picardy</i>. That descriptionis just, but incomplete. At the point of this story which we have nowreached, a little of Father Fauchelevent&rsquo;s physiology becomes useful. Hewas a peasant, but he had been a notary, which added trickery to hiscunning, and penetration to his ingenuousness. Having, through variouscauses, failed in his business, he had descended to the calling of acarter and a laborer. But, in spite of oaths and lashings, which horsesseem to require, something of the notary had lingered in him. He had somenatural wit; he talked good grammar; he conversed, which is a rare thingin a village; and the other peasants said of him: &ldquo;He talks almost like agentleman with a hat.&rdquo; Fauchelevent belonged, in fact, to that species,which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last centuryqualified as <i>demi-bourgeois, demi-lout</i>, and which the metaphorsshowered by the château upon the thatched cottage ticketed in thepigeon-hole of the plebeian: <i>rather rustic, rather citified; pepper andsalt</i>. Fauchelevent, though sorely tried and harshly used by fate, wornout, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, nevertheless, an impulsiveman, and extremely spontaneous in his actions; a precious quality whichprevents one from ever being wicked. His defects and his vices, for he hadsome, were all superficial; in short, his physiognomy was of the kindwhich succeeds with an observer. His aged face had none of thosedisagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead, which signify malice orstupidity.</p><p>At daybreak, Father Fauchelevent opened his eyes, after having done anenormous deal of thinking, and beheld M. Madeleine seated on his truss ofstraw, and watching Cosette&rsquo;s slumbers. Fauchelevent sat up and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Now that you are here, how are you going to contrive to enter?&rdquo;</p><p>This remark summed up the situation and aroused Jean Valjean from hisreverie.</p><p>The two men took counsel together.</p><p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said Fauchelevent, &ldquo;you will begin by not settingfoot outside of this chamber, either you or the child. One step in thegarden and we are done for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Madeleine,&rdquo; resumed Fauchelevent, &ldquo;you have arrived at a veryauspicious moment, I mean to say a very inauspicious moment; one of theladies is very ill. This will prevent them from looking much in ourdirection. It seems that she is dying. The prayers of the forty hours arebeing said. The whole community is in confusion. That occupies them. Theone who is on the point of departure is a saint. In fact, we are allsaints here; all the difference between them and me is that they say &lsquo;ourcell,&rsquo; and that I say &lsquo;my cabin.&rsquo; The prayers for the dying are to besaid, and then the prayers for the dead. We shall be at peace here forto-day; but I will not answer for to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; observed Jean Valjean, &ldquo;this cottage is in the niche of the wall,it is hidden by a sort of ruin, there are trees, it is not visible fromthe convent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I add that the nuns never come near it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>The interrogation mark which accentuated this &ldquo;well&rdquo; signified: &ldquo;it seemsto me that one may remain concealed here?&rdquo; It was to this interrogationpoint that Fauchelevent responded:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There are the little girls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What little girls?&rdquo; asked Jean Valjean.</p><p>Just as Fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he haduttered, a bell emitted one stroke.</p><p>&ldquo;The nun is dead,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There is the knell.&rdquo;</p><p>And he made a sign to Jean Valjean to listen.</p><p>The bell struck a second time.</p><p>&ldquo;It is the knell, Monsieur Madeleine. The bell will continue to strikeonce a minute for twenty-four hours, until the body is taken from thechurch.&mdash;You see, they play. At recreation hours it suffices to havea ball roll aside, to send them all hither, in spite of prohibitions, tohunt and rummage for it all about here. Those cherubs are devils.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;The little girls. You would be very quickly discovered. They wouldshriek: &lsquo;Oh! a man!&rsquo; There is no danger to-day. There will be norecreation hour. The day will be entirely devoted to prayers. You hear thebell. As I told you, a stroke each minute. It is the death knell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I understand, Father Fauchelevent. There are pupils.&rdquo;</p><p>And Jean Valjean thought to himself:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Here is Cosette&rsquo;s education already provided.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardine! There are little girls indeed! And they would bawl around you!And they would rush off! To be a man here is to have the plague. You seehow they fasten a bell to my paw as though I were a wild beast.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean fell into more and more profound thought.&mdash;&ldquo;This conventwould be our salvation,&rdquo; he murmured.</p><p>Then he raised his voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, the difficulty is to remain here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Fauchelevent, &ldquo;the difficulty is to get out.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart.</p><p>&ldquo;To get out!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur Madeleine. In order to return here it is first necessary toget out.&rdquo;</p><p>And after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded,Fauchelevent went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You must not be found here in this fashion. Whence come you? For me, youfall from heaven, because I know you; but the nuns require one to enter bythe door.&rdquo;</p><p>All at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Fauchelevent, &ldquo;they are ringing up the vocal mothers. They aregoing to the chapter. They always hold a chapter when any one dies. Shedied at daybreak. People generally do die at daybreak. But cannot you getout by the way in which you entered? Come, I do not ask for the sake ofquestioning you, but how did you get in?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean turned pale; the very thought of descending again into thatterrible street made him shudder. You make your way out of a forest filledwith tigers, and once out of it, imagine a friendly counsel that shalladvise you to return thither! Jean Valjean pictured to himself the wholepolice force still engaged in swarming in that quarter, agents on thewatch, sentinels everywhere, frightful fists extended towards his collar,Javert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps.</p><p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Father Fauchelevent, say that I fell from thesky.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I believe it, I believe it,&rdquo; retorted Fauchelevent. &ldquo;You have no needto tell me that. The good God must have taken you in his hand for thepurpose of getting a good look at you close to, and then dropped you.Only, he meant to place you in a man&rsquo;s convent; he made a mistake. Come,there goes another peal, that is to order the porter to go and inform themunicipality that the dead-doctor is to come here and view a corpse. Allthat is the ceremony of dying. These good ladies are not at all fond ofthat visit. A doctor is a man who does not believe in anything. He liftsthe veil. Sometimes he lifts something else too. How quickly they have hadthe doctor summoned this time! What is the matter? Your little one isstill asleep. What is her name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She is your daughter? You are her grandfather, that is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will be easy enough for her to get out of here. I have my service doorwhich opens on the courtyard. I knock. The porter opens; I have my vintagebasket on my back, the child is in it, I go out. Father Fauchelevent goesout with his basket&mdash;that is perfectly natural. You will tell thechild to keep very quiet. She will be under the cover. I will leave herfor whatever time is required with a good old friend, a fruit-seller whomI know in the Rue Chemin-Vert, who is deaf, and who has a little bed. Iwill shout in the fruit-seller&rsquo;s ear, that she is a niece of mine, andthat she is to keep her for me until to-morrow. Then the little one willre-enter with you; for I will contrive to have you re-enter. It must bedone. But how will you manage to get out?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;No one must see me, the whole point lies there, Father Fauchelevent. Findsome means of getting me out in a basket, under cover, like Cosette.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of hisleft hand, a sign of serious embarrassment.</p><p>A third peal created a diversion.</p><p>&ldquo;That is the dead-doctor taking his departure,&rdquo; said Fauchelevent. &ldquo;He hastaken a look and said: &lsquo;She is dead, that is well.&rsquo; When the doctor hassigned the passport for paradise, the undertaker&rsquo;s company sends a coffin.If it is a mother, the mothers lay her out; if she is a sister, thesisters lay her out. After which, I nail her up. That forms a part of mygardener&rsquo;s duty. A gardener is a bit of a grave-digger. She is placed in alower hall of the church which communicates with the street, and intowhich no man may enter save the doctor of the dead. I don&rsquo;t count theundertaker&rsquo;s men and myself as men. It is in that hall that I nail up thecoffin. The undertaker&rsquo;s men come and get it, and whip up, coachman!that&rsquo;s the way one goes to heaven. They fetch a box with nothing in it,they take it away again with something in it. That&rsquo;s what a burial islike. <i>De profundis</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>A horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleepingCosette, who lay with her mouth vaguely open, and had the air of an angeldrinking in the light. Jean Valjean had fallen to gazing at her. He was nolonger listening to Fauchelevent.</p><p>That one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence. The goodold gardener went on tranquilly with his babble:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The grave is dug in the Vaugirard cemetery. They declare that they aregoing to suppress that Vaugirard cemetery. It is an ancient cemetery whichis outside the regulations, which has no uniform, and which is going toretire. It is a shame, for it is convenient. I have a friend there, FatherMestienne, the grave-digger. The nuns here possess one privilege, it is tobe taken to that cemetery at nightfall. There is a special permission fromthe Prefecture on their behalf. But how many events have happened sinceyesterday! Mother Crucifixion is dead, and Father Madeleine&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is buried,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, smiling sadly.</p><p>Fauchelevent caught the word.</p><p>&ldquo;Goodness! if you were here for good, it would be a real burial.&rdquo;</p><p>A fourth peal burst out. Fauchelevent hastily detached the belled knee-capfrom its nail and buckled it on his knee again.</p><p>&ldquo;This time it is for me. The Mother Prioress wants me. Good, now I ampricking myself on the tongue of my buckle. Monsieur Madeleine, don&rsquo;t stirfrom here, and wait for me. Something new has come up. If you are hungry,there is wine, bread and cheese.&rdquo;</p><p>And he hastened out of the hut, crying: &ldquo;Coming! coming!&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his crookedleg would permit, casting a sidelong glance by the way on his melon patch.</p><p>Less than ten minutes later, Father Fauchelevent, whose bell put the nunsin his road to flight, tapped gently at a door, and a gentle voicereplied: <i>&ldquo;Forever! Forever!&rdquo; </i> that is to say: <i>&ldquo;Enter.&rdquo; </i></p><p>The door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing thegardener on business. This parlor adjoined the chapter hall. The prioress,seated on the only chair in the parlor, was waiting for Fauchelevent.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0139" id="link2HCH0139"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;FAUCHELEVENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFICULTY</h3><p>It is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions, notablypriests and nuns, to wear a grave and agitated air on critical occasions.At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, this double form of preoccupationwas imprinted on the countenance of the prioress, who was that wise andcharming Mademoiselle de Blemeur, Mother Innocente, who was ordinarilycheerful.</p><p>The gardener made a timid bow, and remained at the door of the cell. Theprioress, who was telling her beads, raised her eyes and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! it is you, Father Fauvent.&rdquo;</p><p>This abbreviation had been adopted in the convent.</p><p>Fauchelevent bowed again.</p><p>&ldquo;Father Fauvent, I have sent for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here I am, reverend Mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have something to say to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And so have I,&rdquo; said Fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him inwardterror, &ldquo;I have something to say to the very reverend Mother.&rdquo;</p><p>The prioress stared at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! you have a communication to make to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A request.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very well, speak.&rdquo;</p><p>Goodman Fauchelevent, the ex-notary, belonged to the category of peasantswho have assurance. A certain clever ignorance constitutes a force; you donot distrust it, and you are caught by it. Fauchelevent had been a successduring the something more than two years which he had passed in theconvent. Always solitary and busied about his gardening, he had nothingelse to do than to indulge his curiosity. As he was at a distance from allthose veiled women passing to and fro, he saw before him only an agitationof shadows. By dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded inclothing all those phantoms with flesh, and those corpses were alive forhim. He was like a deaf man whose sight grows keener, and like a blind manwhose hearing becomes more acute. He had applied himself to riddling outthe significance of the different peals, and he had succeeded, so thatthis taciturn and enigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him; thesphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear. Fauchelevent knew all andconcealed all; that constituted his art. The whole convent thought himstupid. A great merit in religion. The vocal mothers made much ofFauchelevent. He was a curious mute. He inspired confidence. Moreover, hewas regular, and never went out except for well-demonstrated requirementsof the orchard and vegetable garden. This discretion of conduct had inuredto his credit. Nonetheless, he had set two men to chattering: theporter, in the convent, and he knew the singularities of their parlor, andthe grave-digger, at the cemetery, and he was acquainted with thepeculiarities of their sepulture; in this way, he possessed a double lighton the subject of these nuns, one as to their life, the other as to theirdeath. But he did not abuse his knowledge. The congregation thought agreat deal of him. Old, lame, blind to everything, probably a little deafinto the bargain,&mdash;what qualities! They would have found it difficultto replace him.</p><p>The goodman, with the assurance of a person who feels that he isappreciated, entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangueto the reverend prioress. He talked a long time about his age, hisinfirmities, the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth, ofthe increasing demands of his work, of the great size of the garden, ofnights which must be passed, like the last, for instance, when he had beenobliged to put straw mats over the melon beds, because of the moon, and hewound up as follows: &ldquo;That he had a brother&rdquo;&mdash;(the prioress made amovement),&mdash;&ldquo;a brother no longer young&rdquo;&mdash;(a second movement onthe part of the prioress, but one expressive of reassurance),&mdash;&ldquo;that,if he might be permitted, this brother would come and live with him andhelp him, that he was an excellent gardener, that the community wouldreceive from him good service, better than his own; that, otherwise, ifhis brother were not admitted, as he, the elder, felt that his health wasbroken and that he was insufficient for the work, he should be obliged,greatly to his regret, to go away; and that his brother had a littledaughter whom he would bring with him, who might be reared for God in thehouse, and who might, who knows, become a nun some day.&rdquo;</p><p>When he had finished speaking, the prioress stayed the slipping of herrosary between her fingers, and said to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For what purpose?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To serve as a lever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, reverend Mother,&rdquo; replied Fauchelevent.</p><p>The prioress, without adding a word, rose and entered the adjoining room,which was the hall of the chapter, and where the vocal mothers wereprobably assembled. Fauchelevent was left alone.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0140" id="link2HCH0140"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;MOTHER INNOCENTE</h3><p>About a quarter of an hour elapsed. The prioress returned and seatedherself once more on her chair.</p><p>The two interlocutors seemed preoccupied. We will present a stenographicreport of the dialogue which then ensued, to the best of our ability.</p><p>&ldquo;Father Fauvent!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reverend Mother!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know the chapel?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have a little cage there, where I hear the mass and the offices.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two or three times.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is a stone to be raised.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Heavy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The slab which closes the vault?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It would be a good thing to have two men for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mother Ascension, who is as strong as a man, will help you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A woman is never a man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have only a woman here to help you. Each one does what he can. BecauseDom Mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of Saint Bernard,while Merlonus Horstius only gives three hundred and sixty-seven, I do notdespise Merlonus Horstius.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Neither do I.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Merit consists in working according to one&rsquo;s strength. A cloister is nota dock-yard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And a woman is not a man. But my brother is the strong one, though!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And can you get a lever?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is a ring in the stone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will put the lever through it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is good, reverend Mother. I will open the vault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the four Mother Precentors will help you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And when the vault is open?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It must be closed again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will that be all?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give me your orders, very reverend Mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fauvent, we have confidence in you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am here to do anything you wish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And to hold your peace about everything!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, reverend Mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When the vault is open&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will close it again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But before that&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, reverend Mother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something must be lowered into it.&rdquo;</p><p>A silence ensued. The prioress, after a pout of the under lip whichresembled hesitation, broke it.</p><p>&ldquo;Father Fauvent!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reverend Mother!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know that a mother died this morning?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you not hear the bell?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can hardly distinguish my own signal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She died at daybreak.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And then, the wind did not blow in my direction this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was Mother Crucifixion. A blessed woman.&rdquo;</p><p>The prioress paused, moved her lips, as though in mental prayer, andresumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Three years ago, Madame de Béthune, a Jansenist, turned orthodox, merelyfrom having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! yes, now I hear the knell, reverend Mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The mothers have taken her to the dead-room, which opens on the church.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No other man than you can or must enter that chamber. See to that. A finesight it would be, to see a man enter the dead-room!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More often!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More often!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I say more often.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More often than what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reverend Mother, I did not say more often than what, I said more often.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you. Why do you say more often?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In order to speak like you, reverend Mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I did not say &lsquo;more often.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, nine o&rsquo;clock struck.</p><p>&ldquo;At nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning and at all hours, praised and adored bethe most Holy Sacrament of the altar,&rdquo; said the prioress.</p><p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said Fauchelevent.</p><p>The clock struck opportunely. It cut &ldquo;more often&rdquo; short. It is probable,that had it not been for this, the prioress and Fauchelevent would neverhave unravelled that skein.</p><p>Fauchelevent mopped his forehead.</p><p>The prioress indulged in another little inward murmur, probably sacred,then raised her voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts; after her death, shewill perform miracles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She will!&rdquo; replied Father Fauchelevent, falling into step, and strivingnot to flinch again.</p><p>&ldquo;Father Fauvent, the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion. Nodoubt, it is not granted to every one to die, like Cardinal de Bérulle,while saying the holy mass, and to breathe forth their souls to God, whilepronouncing these words: <i>Hanc igitur oblationem</i>. But withoutattaining to such happiness, Mother Crucifixion&rsquo;s death was very precious.She retained her consciousness to the very last moment. She spoke to us,then she spoke to the angels. She gave us her last commands. If you had alittle more faith, and if you could have been in her cell, she would havecured your leg merely by touching it. She smiled. We felt that she wasregaining her life in God. There was something of paradise in that death.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing.</p><p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;Father Fauvent, what the dead wish must be done.&rdquo;</p><p>The prioress took off several beads of her chaplet. Fauchelevent held hispeace.</p><p>She went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in Our Lord,who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life, and who bearwonderful fruit.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reverend Mother, you can hear the knell much better here than in thegarden.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Besides, she is more than a dead woman, she is a saint.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Like yourself, reverend Mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She slept in her coffin for twenty years, by express permission of ourHoly Father, Pius VII.&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The one who crowned the Emp&mdash;Buonaparte.&rdquo;</p><p>For a clever man like Fauchelevent, this allusion was an awkward one.Fortunately, the prioress, completely absorbed in her own thoughts, didnot hear it. She continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father Fauvent?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reverend Mother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Saint Didorus, Archbishop of Cappadocia, desired that this single wordmight be inscribed on his tomb: <i>Acarus</i>, which signifies, a worm ofthe earth; this was done. Is this true?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, reverend Mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The blessed Mezzocane, Abbot of Aquila, wished to be buried beneath thegallows; this was done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Saint Terentius, Bishop of Port, where the mouth of the Tiber emptiesinto the sea, requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign whichwas placed on the graves of parricides, in the hope that passers-by wouldspit on his tomb. This was done. The dead must be obeyed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So be it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The body of Bernard Guidonis, born in France near Roche-Abeille, was, ashe had ordered, and in spite of the king of Castile, borne to the churchof the Dominicans in Limoges, although Bernard Guidonis was Bishop of Tuyin Spain. Can the contrary be affirmed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For that matter, no, reverend Mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The fact is attested by Plantavit de la Fosse.&rdquo;</p><p>Several beads of the chaplet were told off, still in silence. The prioressresumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father Fauvent, Mother Crucifixion will be interred in the coffin inwhich she has slept for the last twenty years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is just.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is a continuation of her slumber.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So I shall have to nail up that coffin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And we are to reject the undertaker&rsquo;s coffin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am at the orders of the very reverend community.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The four Mother Precentors will assist you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In nailing up the coffin? I do not need them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. In lowering the coffin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Into the vault.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What vault?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Under the altar.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent started.</p><p>&ldquo;The vault under the altar?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Under the altar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will have an iron bar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The dead must be obeyed. To be buried in the vault under the altar of thechapel, not to go to profane earth; to remain there in death where sheprayed while living; such was the last wish of Mother Crucifixion. Sheasked it of us; that is to say, commanded us.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it is forbidden.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Forbidden by men, enjoined by God.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What if it became known?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have confidence in you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! I am a stone in your walls.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The chapter assembled. The vocal mothers, whom I have just consultedagain, and who are now deliberating, have decided that Mother Crucifixionshall be buried, according to her wish, in her own coffin, under ouraltar. Think, Father Fauvent, if she were to work miracles here! What aglory of God for the community! And miracles issue from tombs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, reverend Mother, if the agent of the sanitary commission&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Saint Benoît II., in the matter of sepulture, resisted ConstantinePogonatus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the commissary of police&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Chonodemaire, one of the seven German kings who entered among the Gaulsunder the Empire of Constantius, expressly recognized the right of nuns tobe buried in religion, that is to say, beneath the altar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the inspector from the Prefecture&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The world is nothing in the presence of the cross. Martin, the eleventhgeneral of the Carthusians, gave to his order this device: <i>Stat cruxdum volvitur orbis</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said Fauchelevent, who imperturbably extricated himself in thismanner from the dilemma, whenever he heard Latin.</p><p>Any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long. On theday when the rhetorician Gymnastoras left his prison, bearing in his bodymany dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in, he halted infront of the first tree which he came to, harangued it and made very greatefforts to convince it. The prioress, who was usually subjected to thebarrier of silence, and whose reservoir was overfull, rose and exclaimedwith the loquacity of a dam which has broken away:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have on my right Benoît and on my left Bernard. Who was Bernard? Thefirst abbot of Clairvaux. Fontaines in Burgundy is a country that is blestbecause it gave him birth. His father was named Técelin, and his motherAlèthe. He began at Cîteaux, to end in Clairvaux; he was ordained abbot bythe bishop of Châlon-sur-Saône, Guillaume de Champeaux; he had sevenhundred novices, and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries; he overthrewAbeilard at the council of Sens in 1140, and Pierre de Bruys and Henry hisdisciple, and another sort of erring spirits who were called theApostolics; he confounded Arnauld de Brescia, darted lightning at the monkRaoul, the murderer of the Jews, dominated the council of Reims in 1148,caused the condemnation of Gilbert de Poréa, Bishop of Poitiers, causedthe condemnation of Éon de l&rsquo;Étoile, arranged the disputes of princes,enlightened King Louis the Young, advised Pope Eugene III., regulated theTemple, preached the crusade, performed two hundred and fifty miraclesduring his lifetime, and as many as thirty-nine in one day. Who wasBenoît? He was the patriarch of Mont-Cassin; he was the second founder ofthe Sainteté Claustrale, he was the Basil of the West. His order hasproduced forty popes, two hundred cardinals, fifty patriarchs, sixteenhundred archbishops, four thousand six hundred bishops, four emperors,twelve empresses, forty-six kings, forty-one queens, three thousand sixhundred canonized saints, and has been in existence for fourteen hundredyears. On one side Saint Bernard, on the other the agent of the sanitarydepartment! On one side Saint Benoît, on the other the inspector of publicways! The state, the road commissioners, the public undertaker,regulations, the administration, what do we know of all that? There is nota chance passer-by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated.We have not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ! Your sanitarydepartment is a revolutionary invention. God subordinated to thecommissary of police; such is the age. Silence, Fauvent!&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath. The prioresscontinued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture. Only fanatics andthose in error deny it. We live in times of terrible confusion. We do notknow that which it is necessary to know, and we know that which we shouldignore. We are ignorant and impious. In this age there exist people who donot distinguish between the very great Saint Bernard and the Saint Bernarddenominated of the poor Catholics, a certain good ecclesiastic who livedin the thirteenth century. Others are so blasphemous as to compare thescaffold of Louis XVI. to the cross of Jesus Christ. Louis XVI. was merelya king. Let us beware of God! There is no longer just nor unjust. The nameof Voltaire is known, but not the name of César de Bus. Nevertheless,César de Bus is a man of blessed memory, and Voltaire one of unblessedmemory. The last arch-bishop, the Cardinal de Périgord, did not even knowthat Charles de Gondren succeeded to Berulle, and François Bourgoin toGondren, and Jean-François Senault to Bourgoin, and Father Sainte-Martheto Jean-François Senault. The name of Father Coton is known, not becausehe was one of the three who urged the foundation of the Oratorie, butbecause he furnished Henri IV., the Huguenot king, with the material foran oath. That which pleases people of the world in Saint François deSales, is that he cheated at play. And then, religion is attacked. Why?Because there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, Bishop of Gap,was the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and because both of themfollowed Mommol. What has that to do with the question? Does that preventMartin de Tours from being a saint, and giving half of his cloak to abeggar? They persecute the saints. They shut their eyes to the truth.Darkness is the rule. The most ferocious beasts are beasts which areblind. No one thinks of hell as a reality. Oh! how wicked people are! Byorder of the king signifies to-day, by order of the revolution. One nolonger knows what is due to the living or to the dead. A holy death isprohibited. Burial is a civil matter. This is horrible. Saint Leo II.wrote two special letters, one to Pierre Notaire, the other to the king ofthe Visigoths, for the purpose of combating and rejecting, in questionstouching the dead, the authority of the exarch and the supremacy of theEmperor. Gauthier, Bishop of Châlons, held his own in this matter againstOtho, Duke of Burgundy. The ancient magistracy agreed with him. In formertimes we had voices in the chapter, even on matters of the day. The Abbotof Cîteaux, the general of the order, was councillor by right of birth tothe parliament of Burgundy. We do what we please with our dead. Is not thebody of Saint Benoît himself in France, in the abbey of Fleury, calledSaint Benoît-sur-Loire, although he died in Italy at Mont-Cassin, onSaturday, the 21st of the month of March, of the year 543? All this isincontestable. I abhor psalm-singers, I hate priors, I execrate heretics,but I should detest yet more any one who should maintain the contrary. Onehas only to read Arnoul Wion, Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemus, Maurolics, andDom Luc d&rsquo;Achery.&rdquo;</p><p>The prioress took breath, then turned to Fauchelevent.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it settled, Father Fauvent?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is settled, reverend Mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We may depend on you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will obey.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am entirely devoted to the convent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is understood. You will close the coffin. The sisters will carry itto the chapel. The office for the dead will then be said. Then we shallreturn to the cloister. Between eleven o&rsquo;clock and midnight, you will comewith your iron bar. All will be done in the most profound secrecy. Therewill be in the chapel only the four Mother Precentors, Mother Ascensionand yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the sister at the post?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She will not turn round.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But she will hear.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She will not listen. Besides, what the cloister knows the world learnsnot.&rdquo;</p><p>A pause ensued. The prioress went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You will remove your bell. It is not necessary that the sister at thepost should perceive your presence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reverend Mother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, Father Fauvent?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Has the doctor for the dead paid his visit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He will pay it at four o&rsquo;clock to-day. The peal which orders the doctorfor the dead to be summoned has already been rung. But you do notunderstand any of the peals?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I pay no attention to any but my own.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is well, Father Fauvent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reverend Mother, a lever at least six feet long will be required.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where will you obtain it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where gratings are not lacking, iron bars are not lacking. I have my heapof old iron at the bottom of the garden.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About three-quarters of an hour before midnight; do not forget.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reverend Mother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort, my brother is thestrong man for you. A perfect Turk!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will do it as speedily as possible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I cannot work very fast. I am infirm; that is why I require an assistant.I limp.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To limp is no sin, and perhaps it is a blessing. The Emperor Henry II.,who combated Antipope Gregory and re-established Benoît VIII., has twosurnames, the Saint and the Lame.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two surtouts are a good thing,&rdquo; murmured Fauchelevent, who really was alittle hard of hearing.</p><p>&ldquo;Now that I think of it, Father Fauvent, let us give a whole hour to it.That is not too much. Be near the principal altar, with your iron bar, ateleven o&rsquo;clock. The office begins at midnight. Everything must have beencompleted a good quarter of an hour before that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community. These are myorders. I am to nail up the coffin. At eleven o&rsquo;clock exactly, I am to bein the chapel. The Mother Precentors will be there. Mother Ascension willbe there. Two men would be better. However, never mind! I shall have mylever. We will open the vault, we will lower the coffin, and we will closethe vault again. After which, there will be no trace of anything. Thegovernment will have no suspicion. Thus all has been arranged, reverendMother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What else remains?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The empty coffin remains.&rdquo;</p><p>This produced a pause. Fauchelevent meditated. The prioress meditated.</p><p>&ldquo;What is to be done with that coffin, Father Fauvent?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will be given to the earth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Empty?&rdquo;</p><p>Another silence. Fauchelevent made, with his left hand, that sort of agesture which dismisses a troublesome subject.</p><p>&ldquo;Reverend Mother, I am the one who is to nail up the coffin in thebasement of the church, and no one can enter there but myself, and I willcover the coffin with the pall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but the bearers, when they place it in the hearse and lower it intothe grave, will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! the de&mdash;!&rdquo; exclaimed Fauchelevent.</p><p>The prioress began to make the sign of the cross, and looked fixedly atthe gardener. The <i>vil</i> stuck fast in his throat.</p><p>He made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath.</p><p>&ldquo;I will put earth in the coffin, reverend Mother. That will produce theeffect of a corpse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are right. Earth, that is the same thing as man. So you will managethe empty coffin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will make that my special business.&rdquo;</p><p>The prioress&rsquo;s face, up to that moment troubled and clouded, grew sereneonce more. She made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to him.Fauchelevent went towards the door. As he was on the point of passing out,the prioress raised her voice gently:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am pleased with you, Father Fauvent; bring your brother to meto-morrow, after the burial, and tell him to fetch his daughter.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0141" id="link2HCH0141"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;IN WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAS QUITE THE AIR OF HAVING READAUSTIN CASTILLEJO</h3><p>The strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed man;they do not reach their goal very promptly. Moreover, Fauchelevent was ina dilemma. He took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his cottage inthe garden. Cosette had waked up. Jean Valjean had placed her near thefire. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, Jean Valjean was pointingout to her the vintner&rsquo;s basket on the wall, and saying to her, &ldquo;Listenattentively to me, my little Cosette. We must go away from this house, butwe shall return to it, and we shall be very happy here. The good man wholives here is going to carry you off on his back in that.

It is easy enough with the child.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will carry her out?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And she will hold her tongue?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I answer for that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you, Father Madeleine?&rdquo;</p><p>And, after a silence, fraught with anxiety, Fauchelevent exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, get out as you came in!&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean, as in the first instance, contented himself with saying,&ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent grumbled, more to himself than to Jean Valjean:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There is another thing which bothers me. I have said that I would putearth in it. When I come to think it over, the earth instead of the corpsewill not seem like the real thing, it won&rsquo;t do, it will get displaced, itwill move about. The men will bear it. You understand, Father Madeleine,the government will notice it.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he wasraving.</p><p>Fauchelevent went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;How the de&mdash;uce are you going to get out? It must all be done byto-morrow morning. It is to-morrow that I am to bring you in. The prioressexpects you.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense for aservice which he, Fauchelevent, was to render to the community. That itfell among his duties to take part in their burials, that he nailed up thecoffins and helped the grave-digger at the cemetery. That the nun who haddied that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which hadserved her for a bed, and interred in the vault under the altar of thechapel. That the police regulations forbade this, but that she was one ofthose dead to whom nothing is refused. That the prioress and the vocalmothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased. That it was so muchthe worse for the government. That he, Fauchelevent, was to nail up thecoffin in the cell, raise the stone in the chapel, and lower the corpseinto the vault. And that, by way of thanks, the prioress was to admit hisbrother to the house as a gardener, and his niece as a pupil. That hisbrother was M. Madeleine, and that his niece was Cosette. That theprioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening, afterthe counterfeit interment in the cemetery. But that he could not bring M.Madeleine in from the outside if M. Madeleine was not outside. That thatwas the first problem. And then, that there was another: the empty coffin.</p><p>&ldquo;What is that empty coffin?&rdquo; asked Jean Valjean.</p><p>Fauchelevent replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The coffin of the administration.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What coffin? What administration?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A nun dies. The municipal doctor comes and says, &lsquo;A nun has died.&rsquo; Thegovernment sends a coffin. The next day it sends a hearse and undertaker&rsquo;smen to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery. The undertaker&rsquo;s menwill come and lift the coffin; there will be nothing in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Put something in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A corpse? I have none.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A living person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What person?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>Fauchelevent, who was seated, sprang up as though a bomb had burst underhis chair.</p><p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up hisface like a flash from heaven in the winter.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, Fauchelevent, what you have said: &lsquo;Mother Crucifixion is dead.&rsquo;and I add: &lsquo;and Father Madeleine is buried.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! good, you can laugh, you are not speaking seriously.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very seriously, I must get out of this place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;l have told you to find a basket, and a cover for me also.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The basket will be of pine, and the cover a black cloth.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the first place, it will be a white cloth. Nuns are buried in white.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let it be a white cloth, then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are not like other men, Father Madeleine.&rdquo;</p><p>To behold such devices, which are nothing else than the savage and daringinventions of the galleys, spring forth from the peaceable things whichsurrounded him, and mingle with what he called the &ldquo;petty course of lifein the convent,&rdquo; caused Fauchelevent as much amazement as a gull fishingin the gutter of the Rue Saint-Denis would inspire in a passer-by.</p><p>Jean Valjean went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The problem is to get out of here without being seen. This offers themeans. But give me some information, in the first place. How is itmanaged? Where is this coffin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The empty one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Downstairs, in what is called the dead-room. It stands on two trestles,under the pall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How long is the coffin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Six feet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is this dead-room?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening onthe garden, which is closed on the outside by a shutter, and two doors;one leads into the convent, the other into the church.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What church?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The church in the street, the church which any one can enter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you the keys to those two doors?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent; theporter has the key to the door which communicates with the church.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When does the porter open that door?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only to allow the undertaker&rsquo;s men to enter, when they come to get thecoffin. When the coffin has been taken out, the door is closed again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who nails up the coffin?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who spreads the pall over it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you alone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not another man, except the police doctor, can enter the dead-room. Thatis even written on the wall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Could you hide me in that room to-night when every one is asleep?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. But I could hide you in a small, dark nook which opens on thedead-room, where I keep my tools to use for burials, and of which I havethe key.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At what time will the hearse come for the coffin to-morrow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;About three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. The burial will take place at theVaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall. It is not very near.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will remain concealed in your tool-closet all night and all themorning. And how about food? I shall be hungry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will bring you something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger-joints.</p><p>&ldquo;But that is impossible!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bah! Impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank?&rdquo;</p><p>What seemed unprecedented to Fauchelevent was, we repeat, a simple matterto Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean had been in worse straits than this. Any manwho has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit thediameter of the escape. The prisoner is subject to flight as the sick manis subject to a crisis which saves or kills him. An escape is a cure. Whatdoes not a man undergo for the sake of a cure? To have himself nailed upin a case and carried off like a bale of goods, to live for a long time ina box, to find air where there is none, to economize his breath for hours,to know how to stifle without dying&mdash;this was one of Jean Valjean&rsquo;sgloomy talents.</p><p>Moreover, a coffin containing a living being,&mdash;that convict&rsquo;sexpedient,&mdash;is also an imperial expedient. If we are to credit themonk Austin Castillejo, this was the means employed by Charles the Fifth,desirous of seeing the Plombes for the last time after his abdication.</p><p>He had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of Saint-Yuste inthis manner.</p><p>Fauchelevent, who had recovered himself a little, exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;But how will you manage to breathe?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will breathe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that box! The mere thought of it suffocates me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You surely must have a gimlet, you will make a few holes here and there,around my mouth, and you will nail the top plank on loosely.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good! And what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze.&rdquo;</p><p>And Jean Valjean added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father Fauchelevent, we must come to a decision: I must either be caughthere, or accept this escape through the hearse.&rdquo;</p><p>Every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and loungingbetween the two leaves of a half-shut door. Who is there who has not saidto a cat, &ldquo;Do come in!&rdquo; There are men who, when an incident standshalf-open before them, have the same tendency to halt in indecisionbetween two resolutions, at the risk of getting crushed through the abruptclosing of the adventure by fate. The over-prudent, cats as they are, andbecause they are cats, sometimes incur more danger than the audacious.Fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature. But Jean Valjean&rsquo;s coolnessprevailed over him in spite of himself. He grumbled:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, since there is no other means.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The only thing which troubles me is what will take place at thecemetery.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the very point that is not troublesome,&rdquo; exclaimed Fauchelevent.&ldquo;If you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right, I am sure ofgetting you out of the grave. The grave-digger is a drunkard, and a friendof mine. He is Father Mestienne. An old fellow of the old school. Thegrave-digger puts the corpses in the grave, and I put the grave-digger inmy pocket. I will tell you what will take place. They will arrive a littlebefore dusk, three-quarters of an hour before the gates of the cemeteryare closed. The hearse will drive directly up to the grave. I shallfollow; that is my business. I shall have a hammer, a chisel, and somepincers in my pocket. The hearse halts, the undertaker&rsquo;s men knot a ropearound your coffin and lower you down. The priest says the prayers, makesthe sign of the cross, sprinkles the holy water, and takes his departure.I am left alone with Father Mestienne. He is my friend, I tell you. One oftwo things will happen, he will either be sober, or he will not be sober.If he is not drunk, I shall say to him: &lsquo;Come and drink a bout while the<i>Bon Coing</i> [the Good Quince] is open.&rsquo; I carry him off, I get himdrunk,&mdash;it does not take long to make Father Mestienne drunk, healways has the beginning of it about him,&mdash;I lay him under the table,I take his card, so that I can get into the cemetery again, and I returnwithout him. Then you have no longer any one but me to deal with. If he isdrunk, I shall say to him: &lsquo;Be off; I will do your work for you.&rsquo; Off hegoes, and I drag you out of the hole.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean held out his hand, and Fauchelevent precipitated himself uponit with the touching effusion of a peasant.</p><p>&ldquo;That is settled, Father Fauchelevent. All will go well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Provided nothing goes wrong,&rdquo; thought Fauchelevent. &ldquo;In that case, itwould be terrible.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0142" id="link2HCH0142"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE DRUNK IN ORDER TO BE IMMORTAL</h3><p>On the following day, as the sun was declining, the very rare passers-byon the Boulevard du Maine pulled off their hats to an old-fashionedhearse, ornamented with skulls, cross-bones, and tears. This hearsecontained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a largeblack cross, like a huge corpse with drooping arms. A mourning-coach, inwhich could be seen a priest in his surplice, and a choir boy in his redcap, followed. Two undertaker&rsquo;s men in gray uniforms trimmed with blackwalked on the right and the left of the hearse. Behind it came an old manin the garments of a laborer, who limped along. The procession was goingin the direction of the Vaugirard cemetery.</p><p>The handle of a hammer, the blade of a cold chisel, and the antennæ of apair of pincers were visible, protruding from the man&rsquo;s pocket.</p><p>The Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of Paris. Ithad its peculiar usages, just as it had its carriage entrance and its housedoor, which old people in the quarter, who clung tenaciously to ancient words,still called the <i>porte cavalière</i> and the <i>portepiétonne</i>.<a href="#linknote-16" name="linknoteref-16" id="linknoteref-16">16</a>The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Rue Petit-Picpus had obtained permission,as we have already stated, to be buried there in a corner apart, and at night,the plot of land having formerly belonged to their community. The grave-diggersbeing thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter, inthis cemetery, they were subjected to a special discipline. The gates of theParis cemeteries closed, at that epoch, at sundown, and this being a municipalregulation, the Vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the rest. The carriagegate and the house door were two contiguous grated gates, adjoining a pavilionbuilt by the architect Perronet, and inhabited by the door-keeper of thecemetery. These gates, therefore, swung inexorably on their hinges at theinstant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the Invalides. If anygrave-digger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery, there was but oneway for him to get out&mdash;his grave-digger&rsquo;s card furnished by thedepartment of public funerals. A sort of letter-box was constructed in theporter&rsquo;s window. The grave-digger dropped his card into this box, theporter heard it fall, pulled the rope, and the small door opened. If the manhad not his card, he mentioned his name, the porter, who was sometimes in bedand asleep, rose, came out and identified the man, and opened the gate with hiskey; the grave-digger stepped out, but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs.</p><p>This cemetery, with its peculiarities outside the regulations, embarrassedthe symmetry of the administration. It was suppressed a little later than1830. The cemetery of Mont-Parnasse, called the Eastern cemetery,succeeded to it, and inherited that famous dram-shop next to the Vaugirardcemetery, which was surmounted by a quince painted on a board, and whichformed an angle, one side on the drinkers&rsquo; tables, and the other on thetombs, with this sign: <i>Au Bon Coing</i>.</p><p>The Vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery. It wasfalling into disuse. Dampness was invading it, the flowers were desertingit. The bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the Vaugirard;it hinted at poverty. Père-Lachaise if you please! to be buried inPère-Lachaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany. It isrecognized as elegant. The Vaugirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure,planted like an old-fashioned French garden. Straight alleys, box,thuya-trees, holly, ancient tombs beneath aged cypress-trees, and verytall grass. In the evening it was tragic there. There were very lugubriouslines about it.</p><p>The sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the blackcross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery. The lame man whofollowed it was no other than Fauchelevent.</p><p>The interment of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the altar, the exitof Cosette, the introduction of Jean Valjean to the dead-room,&mdash;allhad been executed without difficulty, and there had been no hitch.</p><p>Let us remark in passing, that the burial of Mother Crucifixion under thealtar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight. It is oneof the faults which resemble a duty. The nuns had committed it, not onlywithout difficulty, but even with the applause of their own consciences.In the cloister, what is called the &ldquo;government&rdquo; is only an intermeddlingwith authority, an interference which is always questionable. In the firstplace, the rule; as for the code, we shall see. Make as many laws as youplease, men; but keep them for yourselves. The tribute to Cæsar is neveranything but the remnants of the tribute to God. A prince is nothing inthe presence of a principle.</p><p>Fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame ofmind. His twin plots, the one with the nuns, the one for the convent, theother against it, the other with M. Madeleine, had succeeded, to allappearance. Jean Valjean&rsquo;s composure was one of those powerfultranquillities which are contagious. Fauchelevent no longer felt doubtfulas to his success.</p><p>What remained to be done was a mere nothing. Within the last two years, hehad made good Father Mestienne, a chubby-cheeked person, drunk at leastten times. He played with Father Mestienne. He did what he liked with him.He made him dance according to his whim. Mestienne&rsquo;s head adjusted itselfto the cap of Fauchelevent&rsquo;s will. Fauchelevent&rsquo;s confidence was perfect.</p><p>At the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery,Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse, and said half aloud, as herubbed his big hands:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a fine farce!&rdquo;</p><p>All at once the hearse halted; it had reached the gate. The permission forinterment must be exhibited. The undertaker&rsquo;s man addressed himself to theporter of the cemetery. During this colloquy, which always is productiveof a delay of from one to two minutes, some one, a stranger, came andplaced himself behind the hearse, beside Fauchelevent. He was a sort oflaboring man, who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried amattock under his arm.</p><p>Fauchelevent surveyed this stranger.</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;The man replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The grave-digger.&rdquo;</p><p>If a man could survive the blow of a cannon-ball full in the breast, hewould make the same face that Fauchelevent made.</p><p>&ldquo;The grave-digger?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father Mestienne is the grave-digger.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He was.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! He was?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent had expected anything but this, that a grave-digger coulddie. It is true, nevertheless, that grave-diggers do die themselves. Bydint of excavating graves for other people, one hollows out one&rsquo;s own.</p><p>Fauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open. He had hardly thestrength to stammer:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;But it is not possible!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he persisted feebly, &ldquo;Father Mestienne is the grave-digger.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After Napoleon, Louis XVIII. After Mestienne, Gribier. Peasant, my nameis Gribier.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent, who was deadly pale, stared at this Gribier.</p><p>He was a tall, thin, livid, utterly funereal man. He had the air of anunsuccessful doctor who had turned grave-digger.</p><p>Fauchelevent burst out laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what queer things do happen! Father Mestienne is dead, butlong live little Father Lenoir! Do you know who little Father Lenoir is?He is a jug of red wine. It is a jug of Surêne, morbigou! of real ParisSurêne? Ah! So old Mestienne is dead! I am sorry for it; he was a jollyfellow. But you are a jolly fellow, too. Are you not, comrade? We&rsquo;ll goand have a drink together presently.&rdquo;</p><p>The man replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have been a student. I passed my fourth examination. I never drink.&rdquo;</p><p>The hearse had set out again, and was rolling up the grand alley of thecemetery.</p><p>Fauchelevent had slackened his pace. He limped more out of anxiety thanfrom infirmity.</p><p>The grave-digger walked on in front of him.</p><p>Fauchelevent passed the unexpected Gribier once more in review.</p><p>He was one of those men who, though very young, have the air of age, andwho, though slender, are extremely strong.</p><p>&ldquo;Comrade!&rdquo; cried Fauchelevent.</p><p>The man turned round.</p><p>&ldquo;I am the convent grave-digger.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My colleague,&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>Fauchelevent, who was illiterate but very sharp, understood that he had todeal with a formidable species of man, with a fine talker. He muttered:</p><p>&ldquo;So Father Mestienne is dead.&rdquo;</p><p>The man replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Completely. The good God consulted his note-book which shows when thetime is up. It was Father Mestienne&rsquo;s turn. Father Mestienne died.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent repeated mechanically: &ldquo;The good God&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The good God,&rdquo; said the man authoritatively. &ldquo;According to thephilosophers, the Eternal Father; according to the Jacobins, the SupremeBeing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we not make each other&rsquo;s acquaintance?&rdquo; stammered Fauchelevent.</p><p>&ldquo;It is made. You are a peasant, I am a Parisian.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People do not know each other until they have drunk together. He whoempties his glass empties his heart. You must come and have a drink withme. Such a thing cannot be refused.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Business first.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent thought: &ldquo;I am lost.&rdquo;</p><p>They were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alleyleading to the nuns&rsquo; corner.</p><p>The grave-digger resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Peasant, I have seven small children who must be fed. As they must eat, Icannot drink.&rdquo;</p><p>And he added, with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning aphrase well:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Their hunger is the enemy of my thirst.&rdquo;</p><p>The hearse skirted a clump of cypress-trees, quitted the grand alley,turned into a narrow one, entered the waste land, and plunged into athicket. This indicated the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture.Fauchelevent slackened his pace, but he could not detain the hearse.Fortunately, the soil, which was light and wet with the winter rains,clogged the wheels and retarded its speed.</p><p>He approached the grave-digger.</p><p>&ldquo;They have such a nice little Argenteuil wine,&rdquo; murmured Fauchelevent.</p><p>&ldquo;Villager,&rdquo; retorted the man, &ldquo;I ought not be a grave-digger. My fatherwas a porter at the Prytaneum [Town-Hall]. He destined me for literature.But he had reverses. He had losses on &rsquo;change. I was obliged to renouncethe profession of author. But I am still a public writer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you are not a grave-digger, then?&rdquo; returned Fauchelevent, clutching atthis branch, feeble as it was.</p><p>&ldquo;The one does not hinder the other. I cumulate.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent did not understand this last word.</p><p>&ldquo;Come have a drink,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Here a remark becomes necessary. Fauchelevent, whatever his anguish,offered a drink, but he did not explain himself on one point; who was topay? Generally, Fauchelevent offered and Father Mestienne paid. An offerof a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by thenew grave-digger, and it was necessary to make this offer, but the oldgardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after Rabelais inthe dark, and that not unintentionally. As for himself, Fauchelevent didnot wish to pay, troubled as he was.</p><p>The grave-digger went on with a superior smile:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;One must eat. I have accepted Father Mestienne&rsquo;s reversion. One gets tobe a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes. To the laborof the hand I join the labor of the arm. I have my scrivener&rsquo;s stall inthe market of the Rue de Sèvres. You know? the Umbrella Market. All thecooks of the Red Cross apply to me. I scribble their declarations of loveto the raw soldiers. In the morning I write love letters; in the evening Idig graves. Such is life, rustic.&rdquo;</p><p>The hearse was still advancing. Fauchelevent, uneasy to the last degree,was gazing about him on all sides. Great drops of perspiration trickleddown from his brow.</p><p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued the grave-digger, &ldquo;a man cannot serve two mistresses. Imust choose between the pen and the mattock. The mattock is ruining myhand.&rdquo;</p><p>The hearse halted.</p><p>The choir boy alighted from the mourning-coach, then the priest.</p><p>One of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a pileof earth, beyond which an open grave was visible.</p><p>&ldquo;What a farce this is!&rdquo; repeated Fauchelevent in consternation.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0143" id="link2HCH0143"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;BETWEEN FOUR PLANKS</h3><p>Who was in the coffin? The reader knows. Jean Valjean.</p><p>Jean Valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there, and hecould almost breathe.</p><p>It is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience conferssecurity of the rest. Every combination thought out by Jean Valjean hadbeen progressing, and progressing favorably, since the preceding day. He,like Fauchelevent, counted on Father Mestienne. He had no doubt as to theend. Never was there a more critical situation, never more completecomposure.</p><p>The four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace. Itseemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into JeanValjean&rsquo;s tranquillity.</p><p>From the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow, and he hadfollowed, all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing withdeath.</p><p>Shortly after Fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper plank, JeanValjean had felt himself carried out, then driven off. He knew, from thediminution in the jolting, when they left the pavements and reached theearth road. He had divined, from a dull noise, that they were crossing thebridge of Austerlitz. At the first halt, he had understood that they wereentering the cemetery; at the second halt, he said to himself:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Here is the grave.&rdquo;</p><p>Suddenly, he felt hands seize the coffin, then a harsh grating against theplanks; he explained it to himself as the rope which was being fastenedround the casket in order to lower it into the cavity.</p><p>Then he experienced a giddiness.</p><p>The undertaker&rsquo;s man and the grave-digger had probably allowed the coffinto lose its balance, and had lowered the head before the foot. Herecovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless. Hehad just touched the bottom.</p><p>He had a certain sensation of cold.</p><p>A voice rose above him, glacial and solemn. He heard Latin words, which hedid not understand, pass over him, so slowly that he was able to catchthem one by one:&mdash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Qui dormiunt in terræ pulvere, evigilabunt; alii in vitam æternam, etalii in approbrium, ut videant semper.&rdquo; </i></p><p>A child&rsquo;s voice said:&mdash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;De profundis.&rdquo; </i></p><p>The grave voice began again:&mdash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Requiem æternam dona ei, Domine.&rdquo; </i></p><p>The child&rsquo;s voice responded:&mdash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;Et lux perpetua luceat ei.&rdquo; </i></p><p>He heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain on theplank which covered him.

Fauchelevent felt himself stagger andon the point of falling headlong into the grave himself. He shouted in avoice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to mingle:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Comrade! Before the <i>Bon Coing</i> is shut!&rdquo;</p><p>The grave-digger took some more earth on his shovel. Faucheleventcontinued.</p><p>&ldquo;I will pay.&rdquo;</p><p>And he seized the man&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen to me, comrade. I am the convent grave-digger, I have come to helpyou. It is a business which can be performed at night. Let us begin, then,by going for a drink.&rdquo;</p><p>And as he spoke, and clung to this desperate insistence, this melancholyreflection occurred to him: &ldquo;And if he drinks, will he get drunk?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Provincial,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;if you positively insist upon it, I consent.We will drink. After work, never before.&rdquo;</p><p>And he flourished his shovel briskly. Fauchelevent held him back.</p><p>&ldquo;It is Argenteuil wine, at six.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, come,&rdquo; said the grave-digger, &ldquo;you are a bell-ringer. Ding dong, dingdong, that&rsquo;s all you know how to say. Go hang yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>And he threw in a second shovelful.</p><p>Fauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he wassaying.</p><p>&ldquo;Come along and drink,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;since it is I who pays the bill.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;When we have put the child to bed,&rdquo; said the grave-digger.</p><p>He flung in a third shovelful.</p><p>Then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold to-night, you see, and the corpse would shriek out after us ifwe were to plant her there without a coverlet.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, as he loaded his shovel, the grave-digger bent over, andthe pocket of his waistcoat gaped. Fauchelevent&rsquo;s wild gaze fellmechanically into that pocket, and there it stopped.</p><p>The sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon; there was still lightenough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of thatyawning pocket.</p><p>The sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant can contain,traversed Fauchelevent&rsquo;s pupils. An idea had just occurred to him.</p><p>He thrust his hand into the pocket from behind, without the grave-digger,who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth, observing it, andpulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it.</p><p>The man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave.</p><p>Just as he turned round to get the fifth, Fauchelevent looked calmly athim and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;By the way, you new man, have you your card?&rdquo;</p><p>The grave-digger paused.</p><p>&ldquo;What card?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The sun is on the point of setting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, it is going to put on its nightcap.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The gate of the cemetery will close immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you your card?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! my card?&rdquo; said the grave-digger.</p><p>And he fumbled in his pocket.</p><p>Having searched one pocket, he proceeded to search the other. He passed onto his fobs, explored the first, returned to the second.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have not my card. I must have forgotten it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fifteen francs fine,&rdquo; said Fauchelevent.</p><p>The grave-digger turned green. Green is the pallor of livid people.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Jésus-mon-Dieu-bancroche-à-bas-la-lune!&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-17" name="linknoteref-17" id="linknoteref-17">17</a> he exclaimed. &ldquo;Fifteenfrancs fine!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Three pieces of a hundred sous,&rdquo; said Fauchelevent.</p><p>The grave-digger dropped his shovel.</p><p>Fauchelevent&rsquo;s turn had come.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, come now, conscript,&rdquo; said Fauchelevent, &ldquo;none of this despair. Thereis no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave. Fifteenfrancs is fifteen francs, and besides, you may not be able to pay it. I aman old hand, you are a new one. I know all the ropes and the devices. Iwill give you some friendly advice. One thing is clear, the sun is on thepoint of setting, it is touching the dome now, the cemetery will be closedin five minutes more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; replied the man.</p><p>&ldquo;Five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave, it is ashollow as the devil, this grave, and to reach the gate in season to passit before it is shut.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case, a fine of fifteen francs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fifteen francs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you have time. Where do you live?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A couple of steps from the barrier, a quarter of an hour from here. No.87 Rue de Vaugirard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your bestspeed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is exactly so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Once outside the gate, you gallop home, you get your card, you return,the cemetery porter admits you. As you have your card, there will benothing to pay. And you will bury your corpse. I&rsquo;ll watch it for you inthe meantime, so that it shall not run away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am indebted to you for my life, peasant.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Decamp!&rdquo; said Fauchelevent.</p><p>The grave-digger, overwhelmed with gratitude, shook his hand and set offon a run.</p><p>When the man had disappeared in the thicket, Fauchelevent listened untilhe heard his footsteps die away in the distance, then he leaned over thegrave, and said in a low tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father Madeleine!&rdquo;</p><p>There was no reply.</p><p>Fauchelevent was seized with a shudder. He tumbled rather than climbedinto the grave, flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you there?&rdquo;</p><p>Silence in the coffin.</p><p>Fauchelevent, hardly able to draw his breath for trembling, seized hiscold chisel and his hammer, and pried up the coffin lid.</p><p>Jean Valjean&rsquo;s face appeared in the twilight; it was pale and his eyeswere closed.</p><p>Fauchelevent&rsquo;s hair rose upright on his head, he sprang to his feet, thenfell back against the side of the grave, ready to swoon on the coffin. Hestared at Jean Valjean.</p><p>Jean Valjean lay there pallid and motionless.</p><p>Fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;He is dead!&rdquo;</p><p>And, drawing himself up, and folding his arms with such violence that hisclenched fists came in contact with his shoulders, he cried:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And this is the way I save his life!&rdquo;</p><p>Then the poor man fell to sobbing. He soliloquized the while, for it is anerror to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural. Powerful emotion oftentalks aloud.</p><p>&ldquo;It is Father Mestienne&rsquo;s fault. Why did that fool die? What need wasthere for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one wasexpecting it? It is he who has killed M. Madeleine. Father Madeleine! Heis in the coffin. It is quite handy. All is over. Now, is there any sensein these things? Ah! my God! he is dead! Well! and his little girl, whatam I to do with her? What will the fruit-seller say? The idea of its beingpossible for a man like that to die like this! When I think how he puthimself under that cart! Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine! Pardine! Hewas suffocated, I said so. He wouldn&rsquo;t believe me. Well! Here&rsquo;s a prettytrick to play! He is dead, that good man, the very best man out of all thegood God&rsquo;s good folks! And his little girl! Ah! In the first place, Iwon&rsquo;t go back there myself. I shall stay here. After having done such athing as that! What&rsquo;s the use of being two old men, if we are two oldfools! But, in the first place, how did he manage to enter the convent?That was the beginning of it all. One should not do such things. FatherMadeleine! Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine! Madeleine! MonsieurMadeleine! Monsieur le Maire! He does not hear me. Now get out of thisscrape if you can!&rdquo;</p><p>And he tore his hair.</p><p>A grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance. It wasthe cemetery gate closing.</p><p>Fauchelevent bent over Jean Valjean, and all at once he bounded back andrecoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit.</p><p>Jean Valjean&rsquo;s eyes were open and gazing at him.</p><p>To see a corpse is alarming, to behold a resurrection is almost as muchso. Fauchelevent became like stone, pale, haggard, overwhelmed by allthese excesses of emotion, not knowing whether he had to do with a livingman or a dead one, and staring at Jean Valjean, who was gazing at him.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0019" id="linkimage-0019"></a><img src="images/2b8-7-resurrection.jpg" alt="The Resurrection" width="100%" /></div><p>&ldquo;I fell asleep,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>And he raised himself to a sitting posture.</p><p>Fauchelevent fell on his knees.</p><p>&ldquo;Just, good Virgin! How you frightened me!&rdquo;</p><p>Then he sprang to his feet and cried:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, Father Madeleine!&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean had merely fainted. The fresh air had revived him.</p><p>Joy is the ebb of terror. Fauchelevent found almost as much difficulty inrecovering himself as Jean Valjean had.</p><p>&ldquo;So you are not dead! Oh! How wise you are! I called you so much that youcame back. When I saw your eyes shut, I said: &lsquo;Good! there he is,stifled,&rsquo; I should have gone raving mad, mad enough for a strait jacket.They would have put me in Bicêtre. What do you suppose I should have doneif you had been dead? And your little girl? There&rsquo;s that fruit-seller,&mdash;shewould never have understood it! The child is thrust into your arms, andthen&mdash;the grandfather is dead! What a story! good saints of paradise,what a tale! Ah! you are alive, that&rsquo;s the best of it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am cold,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>This remark recalled Fauchelevent thoroughly to reality, and there waspressing need of it. The souls of these two men were troubled even whenthey had recovered themselves, although they did not realize it, and therewas about them something uncanny, which was the sinister bewildermentinspired by the place.</p><p>&ldquo;Let us get out of here quickly,&rdquo; exclaimed Fauchelevent.</p><p>He fumbled in his pocket, and pulled out a gourd with which he hadprovided himself.</p><p>&ldquo;But first, take a drop,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>The flask finished what the fresh air had begun, Jean Valjean swallowed amouthful of brandy, and regained full possession of his faculties.</p><p>He got out of the coffin, and helped Fauchelevent to nail on the lidagain.</p><p>Three minutes later they were out of the grave.</p><p>Moreover, Fauchelevent was perfectly composed. He took his time. Thecemetery was closed. The arrival of the grave-digger Gribier was not to beapprehended. That &ldquo;conscript&rdquo; was at home busily engaged in looking forhis card, and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings, since itwas in Fauchelevent&rsquo;s pocket. Without a card, he could not get back intothe cemetery.</p><p>Fauchelevent took the shovel, and Jean Valjean the pick-axe, and togetherthey buried the empty coffin.</p><p>When the grave was full, Fauchelevent said to Jean Valjean:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us go. I will keep the shovel; do you carry off the mattock.&rdquo;</p><p>Night was falling.</p><p>Jean Valjean experienced some difficulty in moving and in walking. He hadstiffened himself in that coffin, and had become a little like a corpse.The rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four planks. Hehad, in a manner, to thaw out, from the tomb.</p><p>&ldquo;You are benumbed,&rdquo; said Fauchelevent. &ldquo;It is a pity that I have a gameleg, for otherwise we might step out briskly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean, &ldquo;four paces will put life into my legs oncemore.&rdquo;</p><p>They set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed. Onarriving before the closed gate and the porter&rsquo;s pavilion Fauchelevent,who held the grave-digger&rsquo;s card in his hand, dropped it into the box, theporter pulled the rope, the gate opened, and they went out.</p><p>&ldquo;How well everything is going!&rdquo; said Fauchelevent; &ldquo;what a capital ideathat was of yours, Father Madeleine!&rdquo;</p><p>They passed the Vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world. Inthe neighborhood of the cemetery, a shovel and pick are equal to twopassports.</p><p>The Rue Vaugirard was deserted.</p><p>&ldquo;Father Madeleine,&rdquo; said Fauchelevent as they went along, and raising hiseyes to the houses, &ldquo;Your eyes are better than mine. Show me No. 87.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;There is no one in the street,&rdquo; said Fauchelevent. &ldquo;Give me your mattockand wait a couple of minutes for me.&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent entered No. 87, ascended to the very top, guided by theinstinct which always leads the poor man to the garret, and knocked in thedark, at the door of an attic.</p><p>A voice replied: &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p><p>It was Gribier&rsquo;s voice.</p><p>Fauchelevent opened the door. The grave-digger&rsquo;s dwelling was, like allsuch wretched habitations, an unfurnished and encumbered garret. Apacking-case&mdash;a coffin, perhaps&mdash;took the place of a commode, abutter-pot served for a drinking-fountain, a straw mattress served for abed, the floor served instead of tables and chairs. In a corner, on atattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet, a thin womanand a number of children were piled in a heap. The whole of thispoverty-stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned. One wouldhave said that there had been an earthquake &ldquo;for one.&rdquo; The covers weredisplaced, the rags scattered about, the jug broken, the mother had beencrying, the children had probably been beaten; traces of a vigorous andill-tempered search. It was plain that the grave-digger had made adesperate search for his card, and had made everybody in the garret, fromthe jug to his wife, responsible for its loss. He wore an air ofdesperation.</p><p>But Fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure totake any notice of this sad side of his success.</p><p>He entered and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have brought you back your shovel and pick.&rdquo;</p><p>Gribier gazed at him in stupefaction.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it you, peasant?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And to-morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of thecemetery.&rdquo;</p><p>And he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; demanded Gribier.</p><p>&ldquo;The meaning of it is, that you dropped your card out of your pocket, thatI found it on the ground after you were gone, that I have buried thecorpse, that I have filled the grave, that I have done your work, that theporter will return your card to you, and that you will not have to payfifteen francs. There you have it, conscript.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, villager!&rdquo; exclaimed Gribier, radiant. &ldquo;The next time I will payfor the drinks.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0145" id="link2HCH0145"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;A SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATORY</h3><p>An hour later, in the darkness of night, two men and a child presentedthemselves at No. 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. The elder of the men lifted theknocker and rapped.</p><p>They were Fauchelevent, Jean Valjean, and Cosette.</p><p>The two old men had gone to fetch Cosette from the fruiterer&rsquo;s in the Ruedu Chemin-Vert, where Fauchelevent had deposited her on the preceding day.Cosette had passed these twenty-four hours trembling silently andunderstanding nothing. She trembled to such a degree that she wept. Shehad neither eaten nor slept. The worthy fruit-seller had plied her with ahundred questions, without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy andunvarying gaze. Cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen andheard during the last two days. She divined that they were passing througha crisis. She was deeply conscious that it was necessary to &ldquo;be good.&rdquo; Whohas not experienced the sovereign power of those two words, pronouncedwith a certain accent in the ear of a terrified little being: <i>Saynothing! </i> Fear is mute. Moreover, no one guards a secret like a child.</p><p>But when, at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty-four hours, shebeheld Jean Valjean again, she gave vent to such a cry of joy, that anythoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry, would have guessedthat it issued from an abyss.</p><p>Fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass-words. All thedoors opened.</p><p>Thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and howto get in.</p><p>The porter, who had received his instructions, opened the little servant&rsquo;sdoor which connected the courtyard with the garden, and which could stillbe seen from the street twenty years ago, in the wall at the bottom of thecourt, which faced the carriage entrance.</p><p>The porter admitted all three of them through this door, and from thatpoint they reached the inner, reserved parlor where Fauchelevent, on thepreceding day, had received his orders from the prioress.</p><p>The prioress, rosary in hand, was waiting for them. A vocal mother, withher veil lowered, stood beside her.</p><p>A discreet candle lighted, one might almost say, made a show of lightingthe parlor.</p><p>The prioress passed Jean Valjean in review. There is nothing whichexamines like a downcast eye.</p><p>Then she questioned him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You are the brother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, reverend Mother,&rdquo; replied Fauchelevent.</p><p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ultime Fauchelevent.&rdquo;</p><p>He really had had a brother named Ultime, who was dead.</p><p>&ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;From Picquigny, near Amiens.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is your age?&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Fifty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is your profession?&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Gardener.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you a good Christian?&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Every one is in the family.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is this your little girl?&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, reverend Mother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are her father?&rdquo;</p><p>Fauchelevent replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Her grandfather.&rdquo;</p><p>The vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice</p><p>&ldquo;He answers well.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean had not uttered a single word.</p><p>The prioress looked attentively at Cosette, and said half aloud to thevocal mother:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;She will grow up ugly.&rdquo;</p><p>The two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in thecorner of the parlor, then the prioress turned round and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father Fauvent, you will get another knee-cap with a bell. Two will berequired now.&rdquo;</p><p>On the following day, therefore, two bells were audible in the garden, andthe nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of theirveils. At the extreme end of the garden, under the trees, two men, Fauventand another man, were visible as they dug side by side. An enormous event.Their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each other: &ldquo;He is anassistant gardener.&rdquo;</p><p>The vocal mothers added: &ldquo;He is a brother of Father Fauvent.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean was, in fact, regularly installed; he had his belledknee-cap; henceforth he was official. His name was Ultime Fauchelevent.</p><p>The most powerful determining cause of his admission had been theprioress&rsquo;s observation upon Cosette: &ldquo;She will grow up ugly.&rdquo;</p><p>The prioress, that pronounced prognosticator, immediately took a fancy toCosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil.</p><p>There is nothing that is not strictly logical about this.</p><p>It is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent, women areconscious of their faces; now, girls who are conscious of their beauty donot easily become nuns; the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportionto their good looks, more is to be hoped from the ugly than from thepretty. Hence a lively taste for plain girls.</p><p>The whole of this adventure increased the importance of good, oldFauchelevent; he won a triple success; in the eyes of Jean Valjean, whomhe had saved and sheltered; in those of grave-digger Gribier, who said tohimself: &ldquo;He spared me that fine&rdquo;; with the convent, which, being enabled,thanks to him, to retain the coffin of Mother Crucifixion under the altar,eluded Cæsar and satisfied God. There was a coffin containing a body inthe Petit-Picpus, and a coffin without a body in the Vaugirard cemetery,public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed thereby, but no one wasaware of it.</p><p>As for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great.Fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious ofgardeners. Upon the occasion of the archbishop&rsquo;s next visit, the prioressrecounted the affair to his Grace, making something of a confession at thesame time, and yet boasting of her deed. On leaving the convent, thearchbishop mentioned it with approval, and in a whisper to M. de Latil,Monsieur&rsquo;s confessor, afterwards Archbishop of Reims and Cardinal. Thisadmiration for Fauchelevent became widespread, for it made its way toRome. We have seen a note addressed by the then reigning Pope, Leo XII.,to one of his relatives, a Monsignor in the Nuncio&rsquo;s establishment inParis, and bearing, like himself, the name of Della Genga; it containedthese lines: &ldquo;It appears that there is in a convent in Paris an excellentgardener, who is also a holy man, named Fauvent.&rdquo; Nothing of this triumphreached Fauchelevent in his hut; he went on grafting, weeding, andcovering up his melon beds, without in the least suspecting hisexcellences and his sanctity. Neither did he suspect his glory, any morethan a Durham or Surrey bull whose portrait is published in the <i>LondonIllustrated News</i>, with this inscription: &ldquo;Bull which carried off theprize at the Cattle Show.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0146" id="link2HCH0146"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;CLOISTERED</h3><p>Cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent.</p><p>It was quite natural that Cosette should think herself Jean Valjean&rsquo;sdaughter. Moreover, as she knew nothing, she could say nothing, and then,she would not have said anything in any case. As we have just observed,nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness. Cosette had sufferedso much, that she feared everything, even to speak or to breathe. A singleword had so often brought down an avalanche upon her. She had hardly begunto regain her confidence since she had been with Jean Valjean. Shespeedily became accustomed to the convent. Only she regretted Catherine,but she dared not say so. Once, however, she did say to Jean Valjean:&ldquo;Father, if I had known, I would have brought her away with me.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette had been obliged, on becoming a scholar in the convent, to don thegarb of the pupils of the house. Jean Valjean succeeded in getting them torestore to him the garments which she laid aside. This was the samemourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted theThénardiers&rsquo; inn. It was not very threadbare even now. Jean Valjean lockedup these garments, plus the stockings and the shoes, with a quantity ofcamphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound, in a little valisewhich he found means of procuring. He set this valise on a chair near hisbed, and he always carried the key about his person. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; Cosetteasked him one day, &ldquo;what is there in that box which smells so good?&rdquo;</p><p>Father Fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action, inaddition to the glory which we just mentioned, and of which he knewnothing; in the first place it made him happy; next, he had much lesswork, since it was shared. Lastly, as he was very fond of snuff, he foundthe presence of M. Madeleine an advantage, in that he used three times asmuch as he had done previously, and that in an infinitely more luxuriousmanner, seeing that M. Madeleine paid for it.</p><p>The nuns did not adopt the name of Ultime; they called Jean Valjean <i>theother Fauvent</i>.</p><p>If these holy women had possessed anything of Javert&rsquo;s glance, they wouldeventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be done outsidein the behalf of the garden, it was always the elder Fauchelevent, theold, the infirm, the lame man, who went, and never the other; but whetherit is that eyes constantly fixed on God know not how to spy, or whetherthey were, by preference, occupied in keeping watch on each other, theypaid no heed to this.</p><p>Moreover, it was well for Jean Valjean that he kept close and did not stirout. Javert watched the quarter for more than a month.</p><p>This convent was for Jean Valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs.Henceforth, those four walls constituted his world. He saw enough of thesky there to enable him to preserve his serenity, and Cosette enough toremain happy.</p><p>A very sweet life began for him.</p><p>He inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden, in company withFauchelevent. This hovel, built of old rubbish, which was still inexistence in 1845, was composed, as the reader already knows, of threechambers, all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the walls.The principal one had been given up, by force, for Jean Valjean hadopposed it in vain, to M. Madeleine, by Father Fauchelevent. The walls ofthis chamber had for ornament, in addition to the two nails whereon tohang the knee-cap and the basket, a Royalist bank-note of &rsquo;93, applied tothe wall over the chimney-piece, and of which the following is an exactfacsimile:&mdash;</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0020" id="linkimage-0020"></a><img src="images/2b8-9-baknote.jpg" alt="Royalist Bank-note" width="100%" /></div><p>This specimen of Vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by thepreceding gardener, an old Chouan, who had died in the convent, and whoseplace Fauchelevent had taken.</p><p>Jean Valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very useful.He had formerly been a pruner of trees, and he gladly found himself agardener once more. It will be remembered that he knew all sorts ofsecrets and receipts for agriculture. He turned these to advantage. Almostall the trees in the orchard were ungrafted, and wild. He budded them andmade them produce excellent fruit.</p><p>Cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day. As the sisterswere melancholy and he was kind, the child made comparisons and adoredhim. At the appointed hour she flew to the hut. When she entered the lowlycabin, she filled it with paradise. Jean Valjean blossomed out and felthis happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded Cosette. Thejoy which we inspire has this charming property, that, far from growingmeagre, like all reflections, it returns to us more radiant than ever. Atrecreation hours, Jean Valjean watched her running and playing in thedistance, and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest.</p><p>For Cosette laughed now.</p><p>Cosette&rsquo;s face had even undergone a change, to a certain extent. The gloomhad disappeared from it. A smile is the same as sunshine; it banisheswinter from the human countenance.</p><p>Recreation over, when Cosette went into the house again, Jean Valjeangazed at the windows of her class-room, and at night he rose to look atthe windows of her dormitory.</p><p>God has his own ways, moreover; the convent contributed, like Cosette, touphold and complete the Bishop&rsquo;s work in Jean Valjean. It is certain thatvirtue adjoins pride on one side. A bridge built by the devil existsthere. Jean Valjean had been, unconsciously, perhaps, tolerably near thatside and that bridge, when Providence cast his lot in the convent of thePetit-Picpus; so long as he had compared himself only to the Bishop, hehad regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble; but for sometime past he had been comparing himself to men in general, and pride wasbeginning to spring up. Who knows? He might have ended by returning verygradually to hatred.</p><p>The convent stopped him on that downward path.</p><p>This was the second place of captivity which he had seen. In his youth, inwhat had been for him the beginning of his life, and later on, quiterecently again, he had beheld another,&mdash;a frightful place, a terribleplace, whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity ofjustice, and the crime of the law. Now, after the galleys, he saw thecloister; and when he meditated how he had formed a part of the galleys,and that he now, so to speak, was a spectator of the cloister, heconfronted the two in his own mind with anxiety.</p><p>Sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe, and slowly descendedthe endless spirals of reverie.</p><p>He recalled his former companions: how wretched they were; they rose atdawn, and toiled until night; hardly were they permitted to sleep; theylay on camp beds, where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inchesthick, in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of theyear; they were clothed in frightful red blouses; they were allowed, as agreat favor, linen trousers in the hottest weather, and a woollen carter&rsquo;sblouse on their backs when it was very cold; they drank no wine, and ateno meat, except when they went on &ldquo;fatigue duty.&rdquo; They lived nameless,designated only by numbers, and converted, after a manner, into ciphersthemselves, with downcast eyes, with lowered voices, with shorn heads,beneath the cudgel and in disgrace.</p><p>Then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes.</p><p>These beings also lived with shorn heads, with downcast eyes, with loweredvoices, not in disgrace, but amid the scoffs of the world, not with theirbacks bruised with the cudgel, but with their shoulders lacerated withtheir discipline. Their names, also, had vanished from among men; they nolonger existed except under austere appellations. They never ate meat andthey never drank wine; they often remained until evening without food;they were attired, not in a red blouse, but in a black shroud, of woollen,which was heavy in summer and thin in winter, without the power to add orsubtract anything from it; without having even, according to the season,the resource of the linen garment or the woollen cloak; and for six monthsin the year they wore serge chemises which gave them fever. They dwelt,not in rooms warmed only during rigorous cold, but in cells where no firewas ever lighted; they slept, not on mattresses two inches thick, but onstraw. And finally, they were not even allowed their sleep; every night,after a day of toil, they were obliged, in the weariness of their firstslumber, at the moment when they were falling sound asleep and beginningto get warm, to rouse themselves, to rise and to go and pray in anice-cold and gloomy chapel, with their knees on the stones.</p><p>On certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelvesuccessive hours in a kneeling posture, or prostrate, with face upon thepavement, and arms outstretched in the form of a cross.</p><p>The others were men; these were women.</p><p>What had those men done? They had stolen, violated, pillaged, murdered,assassinated. They were bandits, counterfeiters, poisoners, incendiaries,murderers, parricides. What had these women done? They had done nothingwhatever.</p><p>On the one hand, highway robbery, fraud, deceit, violence, sensuality,homicide, all sorts of sacrilege, every variety of crime; on the other,one thing only, innocence.</p><p>Perfect innocence, almost caught up into heaven in a mysteriousassumption, attached to the earth by virtue, already possessing somethingof heaven through holiness.</p><p>On the one hand, confidences over crimes, which are exchanged in whispers;on the other, the confession of faults made aloud. And what crimes! Andwhat faults!</p><p>On the one hand, miasms; on the other, an ineffable perfume. On the onehand, a moral pest, guarded from sight, penned up under the range ofcannon, and literally devouring its plague-stricken victims; on the other,the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth. There, darkness; here,the shadow; but a shadow filled with gleams of light, and of gleams fullof radiance.</p><p>Two strongholds of slavery; but in the first, deliverance possible, alegal limit always in sight, and then, escape. In the second, perpetuity;the sole hope, at the distant extremity of the future, that faint light ofliberty which men call death.</p><p>In the first, men are bound only with chains; in the other, chained byfaith.</p><p>What flowed from the first? An immense curse, the gnashing of teeth,hatred, desperate viciousness, a cry of rage against human society, asarcasm against heaven.</p><p>What results flowed from the second? Blessings and love.</p><p>And in these two places, so similar yet so unlike, these two species ofbeings who were so very unlike, were undergoing the same work, expiation.</p><p>Jean Valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former; thatpersonal expiation, the expiation for one&rsquo;s self. But he did notunderstand that of these last, that of creatures without reproach andwithout stain, and he trembled as he asked himself: The expiation of what?What expiation?</p><p>A voice within his conscience replied: &ldquo;The most divine of humangenerosities, the expiation for others.&rdquo;</p><p>Here all personal theory is withheld; we are only the narrator; we placeourselves at Jean Valjean&rsquo;s point of view, and we translate hisimpressions.</p><p>Before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation, the highestpossible pitch of virtue; the innocence which pardons men their faults,and which expiates in their stead; servitude submitted to, tortureaccepted, punishment claimed by souls which have not sinned, for the sakeof sparing it to souls which have fallen; the love of humanity swallowedup in the love of God, but even there preserving its distinct andmediatorial character; sweet and feeble beings possessing the misery ofthose who are punished and the smile of those who are recompensed.</p><p>And he remembered that he had dared to murmur!</p><p>Often, in the middle of the night, he rose to listen to the grateful songof those innocent creatures weighed down with severities, and the bloodran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justly chastisedraised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy, and that he, wretch thathe was, had shaken his fist at God.</p><p>There was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply, like awarning whisper from Providence itself: the scaling of that wall, thepassing of those barriers, the adventure accepted even at the risk ofdeath, the painful and difficult ascent, all those efforts even, which hehad made to escape from that other place of expiation, he had made inorder to gain entrance into this one. Was this a symbol of his destiny?This house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance to thatother one whence he had fled, and yet he had never conceived an idea ofanything similar.</p><p>Again he beheld gratings, bolts, iron bars&mdash;to guard whom? Angels.</p><p>These lofty walls which he had seen around tigers, he now beheld once morearound lambs.</p><p>This was a place of expiation, and not of punishment; and yet, it wasstill more austere, more gloomy, and more pitiless than the other.</p><p>These virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts. A cold,harsh wind, that wind which had chilled his youth, traversed the barredand padlocked grating of the vultures; a still harsher and more bitingbreeze blew in the cage of these doves.</p><p>Why?</p><p>When he thought on these things, all that was within him was lost inamazement before this mystery of sublimity.</p><p>In these meditations, his pride vanished. He scrutinized his own heart inall manner of ways; he felt his pettiness, and many a time he wept. Allthat had entered into his life for the last six months had led him backtowards the Bishop&rsquo;s holy injunctions; Cosette through love, the conventthrough humility.</p><p>Sometimes at eventide, in the twilight, at an hour when the garden wasdeserted, he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk whichskirted the chapel, in front of the window through which he had gazed onthe night of his arrival, and turned towards the spot where, as he knew,the sister was making reparation, prostrated in prayer. Thus he prayed ashe knelt before the sister.</p><p>It seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before God.</p><p>Everything that surrounded him, that peaceful garden, those fragrantflowers, those children who uttered joyous cries, those grave and simplewomen, that silent cloister, slowly permeated him, and little by little,his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister, of perfume likethe flowers, of simplicity like the women, of joy like the children. Andthen he reflected that these had been two houses of God which had receivedhim in succession at two critical moments in his life: the first, when alldoors were closed and when human society rejected him; the second, at amoment when human society had again set out in pursuit of him, and whenthe galleys were again yawning; and that, had it not been for the first,he should have relapsed into crime, and had it not been for the second,into torment.</p><p>His whole heart melted in gratitude, and he loved more and more.</p><p>Many years passed in this manner; Cosette was growing up.</p><p>[THE END OF VOLUME II &ldquo;COSETTE&rdquo;]</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h2><a name="link2H_4_0168" id="link2H_4_0168"></a>VOLUME III<br />MARIUS</h2><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0021" id="linkimage-0021"></a><img src="images/3frontispiece.jpg" alt="Frontispiece Volume Three" width="100%" /></div><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0022" id="linkimage-0022"></a><img src="images/3titlepage.jpg" alt="Titlepage Volume Three" width="100%" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0169" id="link2H_4_0169"></a>BOOK FIRST&mdash;PARIS STUDIED IN ITS ATOM</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0147" id="link2HCH0147"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;PARVULUS</h3><p>Paris has a child, and the forest has a bird; the bird is called thesparrow; the child is called the gamin.</p><p>Couple these two ideas which contain, the one all the furnace, the otherall the dawn; strike these two sparks together, Paris, childhood; thereleaps out from them a little being. <i>Homuncio</i>, Plautus would say.</p><p>This little being is joyous.

To study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal. End of thetrees, beginning of the roofs; end of the grass, beginning of thepavements; end of the furrows, beginning of the shops, end of thewheel-ruts, beginning of the passions; end of the divine murmur, beginningof the human uproar; hence an extraordinary interest.</p><p>Hence, in these not very attractive places, indelibly stamped by thepassing stroller with the epithet: <i>melancholy</i>, the apparentlyobjectless promenades of the dreamer.</p><p>He who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers ofParis, and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs. That close-shaventurf, those pebbly paths, that chalk, those pools, those harsh monotoniesof waste and fallow lands, the plants of early market-garden suddenlyspringing into sight in a bottom, that mixture of the savage and thecitizen, those vast desert nooks where the garrison drums practisenoisily, and produce a sort of lisping of battle, those hermits by day andcut-throats by night, that clumsy mill which turns in the wind, thehoisting-wheels of the quarries, the tea-gardens at the corners of thecemeteries; the mysterious charm of great, sombre walls squarelyintersecting immense, vague stretches of land inundated with sunshine andfull of butterflies,&mdash;all this attracted him.</p><p>There is hardly any one on earth who is not acquainted with those singularspots, the Glacière, the Cunette, the hideous wall of Grenelle allspeckled with balls, Mont-Parnasse, the Fosse-aux-Loups, Aubiers on thebank of the Marne, Mont-Souris, the Tombe-Issoire, the Pierre-Plate deChâtillon, where there is an old, exhausted quarry which no longer servesany purpose except to raise mushrooms, and which is closed, on a levelwith the ground, by a trap-door of rotten planks. The campagna of Rome isone idea, the banlieue of Paris is another; to behold nothing but fields,houses, or trees in what a stretch of country offers us, is to remain onthe surface; all aspects of things are thoughts of God. The spot where aplain effects its junction with a city is always stamped with a certainpiercing melancholy. Nature and humanity both appeal to you at the sametime there. Local originalities there make their appearance.</p><p>Any one who, like ourselves, has wandered about in these solitudescontiguous to our faubourgs, which may be designated as the limbos ofParis, has seen here and there, in the most desert spot, at the mostunexpected moment, behind a meagre hedge, or in the corner of a lugubriouswall, children grouped tumultuously, fetid, muddy, dusty, ragged,dishevelled, playing hide-and-seek, and crowned with corn-flowers. All ofthem are little ones who have made their escape from poor families. Theouter boulevard is their breathing space; the suburbs belong to them.There they are eternally playing truant. There they innocently sing theirrepertory of dirty songs. There they are, or rather, there they exist, farfrom every eye, in the sweet light of May or June, kneeling round a holein the ground, snapping marbles with their thumbs, quarrelling overhalf-farthings, irresponsible, volatile, free and happy; and, no sooner dothey catch sight of you than they recollect that they have an industry,and that they must earn their living, and they offer to sell you an oldwoollen stocking filled with cockchafers, or a bunch of lilacs. Theseencounters with strange children are one of the charming and at the sametime poignant graces of the environs of Paris.</p><p>Sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys,&mdash;are theytheir sisters?&mdash;who are almost young maidens, thin, feverish, withsunburnt hands, covered with freckles, crowned with poppies and ears ofrye, gay, haggard, barefooted. They can be seen devouring cherries amongthe wheat. In the evening they can be heard laughing. These groups, warmlyilluminated by the full glow of midday, or indistinctly seen in thetwilight, occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time, and thesevisions mingle with his dreams.</p><p>Paris, centre, banlieue, circumference; this constitutes all the earth tothose children. They never venture beyond this. They can no more escapefrom the Parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the water. Forthem, nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers: Ivry, Gentilly,Arcueil, Belleville, Aubervilliers, Ménilmontant, Choisy-le-Roi,Billancourt, Meudon, Issy, Vanvre, Sèvres, Puteaux, Neuilly,Gennevilliers, Colombes, Romainville, Chatou, Asnières, Bougival,Nanterre, Enghien, Noisy-le-Sec, Nogent, Gournay, Drancy, Gonesse; theuniverse ends there.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0152" id="link2HCH0152"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;A BIT OF HISTORY</h3><p>At the epoch, nearly contemporary by the way, when the action of this booktakes place, there was not, as there is to-day, a policeman at the cornerof every street (a benefit which there is no time to discuss here); straychildren abounded in Paris. The statistics give an average of two hundredand sixty homeless children picked up annually at that period, by thepolice patrols, in unenclosed lands, in houses in process of construction,and under the arches of the bridges. One of these nests, which has becomefamous, produced &ldquo;the swallows of the bridge of Arcola.&rdquo; This is,moreover, the most disastrous of social symptoms. All crimes of the manbegin in the vagabondage of the child.</p><p>Let us make an exception in favor of Paris, nevertheless. In a relativemeasure, and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled, theexception is just. While in any other great city the vagabond child is alost man, while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is, in somesort, sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the publicvices which devour in him honesty and conscience, the street boy of Paris,we insist on this point, however defaced and injured on the surface, isalmost intact on the interior. It is a magnificent thing to put on record,and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of our popularrevolutions, that a certain incorruptibility results from the idea whichexists in the air of Paris, as salt exists in the water of the ocean. Tobreathe Paris preserves the soul.</p><p>What we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart whichone experiences every time that one meets one of these children aroundwhom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads of a broken family.In the civilization of the present day, incomplete as it still is, it isnot a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families pouringthemselves out into the darkness, not knowing clearly what has become oftheir children, and allowing their own entrails to fall on the publichighway. Hence these obscure destinies. This is called, for this sad thinghas given rise to an expression, &ldquo;to be cast on the pavements of Paris.&rdquo;</p><p>Let it be said by the way, that this abandonment of children was notdiscouraged by the ancient monarchy. A little of Egypt and Bohemia in thelower regions suited the upper spheres, and compassed the aims of thepowerful. The hatred of instruction for the children of the people was adogma. What is the use of &ldquo;half-lights&rdquo;? Such was the countersign. Now,the erring child is the corollary of the ignorant child.</p><p>Besides this, the monarchy sometimes was in need of children, and in thatcase it skimmed the streets.</p><p>Under Louis XIV., not to go any further back, the king rightly desired tocreate a fleet. The idea was a good one. But let us consider the means.There can be no fleet, if, beside the sailing ship, that plaything of thewinds, and for the purpose of towing it, in case of necessity, there isnot the vessel which goes where it pleases, either by means of oars or ofsteam; the galleys were then to the marine what steamers are to-day.Therefore, galleys were necessary; but the galley is moved only by thegalley-slave; hence, galley-slaves were required. Colbert had thecommissioners of provinces and the parliaments make as many convicts aspossible. The magistracy showed a great deal of complaisance in thematter. A man kept his hat on in the presence of a procession&mdash;it wasa Huguenot attitude; he was sent to the galleys. A child was encounteredin the streets; provided that he was fifteen years of age and did not knowwhere he was to sleep, he was sent to the galleys. Grand reign; grandcentury.</p><p>Under Louis XV. children disappeared in Paris; the police carried themoff, for what mysterious purpose no one knew. People whispered with terrormonstrous conjectures as to the king&rsquo;s baths of purple. Barbier speaksingenuously of these things. It sometimes happened that the exempts of theguard, when they ran short of children, took those who had fathers. Thefathers, in despair, attacked the exempts. In that case, the parliamentintervened and had some one hung. Who? The exempts? No, the fathers.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0153" id="link2HCH0153"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE GAMIN SHOULD HAVE HIS PLACE IN THE CLASSIFICATIONSOF INDIA</h3><p>The body of street Arabs in Paris almost constitutes a caste. One mightalmost say: Not every one who wishes to belong to it can do so.</p><p>This word <i>gamin</i> was printed for the first time, and reached popularspeech through the literary tongue, in 1834. It is in a little workentitled <i>Claude Gueux</i> that this word made its appearance. Thehorror was lively. The word passed into circulation.</p><p>The elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins for eachother are very various. We have known and associated with one who wasgreatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall fromthe top of the tower of Notre-Dame; another, because he had succeeded inmaking his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of the dome ofthe Invalides had been temporarily deposited, and had &ldquo;prigged&rdquo; some leadfrom them; a third, because he had seen a diligence tip over; stillanother, because he &ldquo;knew&rdquo; a soldier who came near putting out the eye ofa citizen.</p><p>This explains that famous exclamation of a Parisian gamin, a profoundepiphonema, which the vulgar herd laughs at without comprehending,&mdash;<i>Dieu de Dieu! What ill-luck I do have! to think that I have never yetseen anybody tumble from a fifth-story window! </i> (<i>I have</i>pronounced <i>I&rsquo;ave</i> and <i>fifth</i> pronounced <i>fift&rsquo;</i>.)</p><p>Surely, this saying of a peasant is a fine one: &ldquo;Father So-and-So, yourwife has died of her malady; why did you not send for the doctor?&rdquo; &ldquo;Whatwould you have, sir, we poor folks <i>die of ourselves</i>.&rdquo; But if thepeasant&rsquo;s whole passivity lies in this saying, the whole of thefree-thinking anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is, assuredly,contained in this other saying. A man condemned to death is listening tohis confessor in the tumbrel. The child of Paris exclaims: &ldquo;He is talkingto his black cap! Oh, the sneak!&rdquo;</p><p>A certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin. To bestrong-minded is an important item.</p><p>To be present at executions constitutes a duty. He shows himself at theguillotine, and he laughs. He calls it by all sorts of pet names: The Endof the Soup, The Growler, The Mother in the Blue (the sky), The LastMouthful, etc., etc. In order not to lose anything of the affair, hescales the walls, he hoists himself to balconies, he ascends trees, hesuspends himself to gratings, he clings fast to chimneys. The gamin isborn a tiler as he is born a mariner. A roof inspires him with no morefear than a mast. There is no festival which comes up to an execution onthe Place de Grève. Samson and the Abbé Montès are the truly popularnames. They hoot at the victim in order to encourage him. They sometimesadmire him. Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seeing the hideous Dautin diebravely, uttered these words which contain a future: &ldquo;I was jealous ofhim.&rdquo; In the brotherhood of gamins Voltaire is not known, but Papavoineis. &ldquo;Politicians&rdquo; are confused with assassins in the same legend. Theyhave a tradition as to everybody&rsquo;s last garment. It is known that Tolleronhad a fireman&rsquo;s cap, Avril an otter cap, Losvel a round hat, that oldDelaporte was bald and bareheaded, that Castaing was all ruddy and veryhandsome, that Bories had a romantic small beard, that Jean Martin kept onhis suspenders, that Lecouffé and his mother quarrelled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t reproacheach other for your basket,&rdquo; shouted a gamin to them. Another, in order toget a look at Debacker as he passed, and being too small in the crowd,caught sight of the lantern on the quay and climbed it. A gendarmestationed opposite frowned. &ldquo;Let me climb up, m&rsquo;sieu le gendarme,&rdquo; saidthe gamin. And, to soften the heart of the authorities he added: &ldquo;I willnot fall.&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you do,&rdquo; retorted the gendarme.</p><p>In the brotherhood of gamins, a memorable accident counts for a greatdeal. One reaches the height of consideration if one chances to cut one&rsquo;sself very deeply, &ldquo;to the very bone.&rdquo;</p><p>The fist is no mediocre element of respect. One of the things that thegamin is fondest of saying is: &ldquo;I am fine and strong, come now!&rdquo; To beleft-handed renders you very enviable. A squint is highly esteemed.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0154" id="link2HCH0154"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND A CHARMING SAYING OF THELAST KING</h3><p>In summer, he metamorphoses himself into a frog; and in the evening, whennight is falling, in front of the bridges of Austerlitz and Jena, from thetops of coal wagons, and the washerwomen&rsquo;s boats, he hurls himselfheadlong into the Seine, and into all possible infractions of the laws ofmodesty and of the police. Nevertheless the police keep an eye on him, andthe result is a highly dramatic situation which once gave rise to afraternal and memorable cry; that cry which was celebrated about 1830, isa strategic warning from gamin to gamin; it scans like a verse from Homer,with a notation as inexpressible as the eleusiac chant of the Panathenæa,and in it one encounters again the ancient Evohe. Here it is: &ldquo;Ohé, Titi,ohééé! Here comes the bobby, here comes the p&rsquo;lice, pick up your duds andbe off, through the sewer with you!&rdquo;</p><p>Sometimes this gnat&mdash;that is what he calls himself&mdash;knows how toread; sometimes he knows how to write; he always knows how to daub. Hedoes not hesitate to acquire, by no one knows what mysterious mutualinstruction, all the talents which can be of use to the public; from 1815to 1830, he imitated the cry of the turkey; from 1830 to 1848, he scrawledpears on the walls. One summer evening, when Louis Philippe was returninghome on foot, he saw a little fellow, no higher than his knee, perspiringand climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on one of the pillarsof the gate of Neuilly; the King, with that good-nature which came to himfrom Henry IV., helped the gamin, finished the pear, and gave the child alouis, saying: &ldquo;The pear is on that also.&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-19" name="linknoteref-19" id="linknoteref-19">19</a> The gamin loves uproar. Acertain state of violence pleases him. He execrates &ldquo;the curés.&rdquo; One day,in the Rue de l&rsquo;Université, one of these scamps was putting his thumb tohis nose at the carriage gate of No. 69. &ldquo;Why are you doing that at thegate?&rdquo; a passer-by asked. The boy replied: &ldquo;There is a curé there.&rdquo; It wasthere, in fact, that the Papal Nuncio lived.</p><p>Nevertheless, whatever may be the Voltairianism of the small gamin, if theoccasion to become a chorister presents itself, it is quite possible thathe will accept, and in that case he serves the mass civilly. There are twothings to which he plays Tantalus, and which he always desires withoutever attaining them: to overthrow the government, and to get his trouserssewed up again.</p><p>The gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of Paris, andcan always put the name to the face of any one which he chances to meet.He can tell them off on the tips of his fingers. He studies their habits,and he has special notes on each one of them. He reads the souls of thepolice like an open book. He will tell you fluently and without flinching:&ldquo;Such an one is a <i>traitor</i>; such another is very <i>malicious</i>;such another is <i>great</i>; such another is <i>ridiculous</i>.&rdquo; (Allthese words: traitor, malicious, great, ridiculous, have a particularmeaning in his mouth.) That one imagines that he owns the Pont-Neuf, andhe prevents <i>people</i> from walking on the cornice outside the parapet;that other has a mania for pulling <i>person&rsquo;s</i> ears; etc., etc.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0155" id="link2HCH0155"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE OLD SOUL OF GAUL</h3><p>There was something of that boy in Poquelin, the son of the fish-market;Beaumarchais had something of it. Gaminerie is a shade of the Gallicspirit. Mingled with good sense, it sometimes adds force to the latter, asalcohol does to wine. Sometimes it is a defect. Homer repeats himselfeternally, granted; one may say that Voltaire plays the gamin. CamilleDesmoulins was a native of the faubourgs. Championnet, who treatedmiracles brutally, rose from the pavements of Paris; he had, when a smalllad, inundated the porticos of Saint-Jean de Beauvais, and ofSaint-Étienne du Mont; he had addressed the shrine of Sainte-Genevièvefamiliarly to give orders to the phial of Saint Januarius.</p><p>The gamin of Paris is respectful, ironical, and insolent. He hasvillainous teeth, because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers, andhandsome eyes because he has wit. If Jehovah himself were present, hewould go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot. He is strong onboxing. All beliefs are possible to him. He plays in the gutter, andstraightens himself up with a revolt; his effrontery persists even in thepresence of grape-shot; he was a scapegrace, he is a hero; like the littleTheban, he shakes the skin from the lion; Barra the drummer-boy was agamin of Paris; he Shouts: &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; as the horse of Scripture says&ldquo;Vah!&rdquo; and in a moment he has passed from the small brat to the giant.</p><p>This child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal. Measure thatspread of wings which reaches from Molière to Barra.</p><p>To sum up the whole, and in one word, the gamin is a being who amuseshimself, because he is unhappy.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0156" id="link2HCH0156"></a>CHAPTER X&mdash;ECCE PARIS, ECCE HOMO</h3><p>To sum it all up once more, the Paris gamin of to-day, like the <i>græculus</i>of Rome in days gone by, is the infant populace with the wrinkle of theold world on his brow.</p><p>The gamin is a grace to the nation, and at the same time a disease; adisease which must be cured, how? By light.</p><p>Light renders healthy.</p><p>Light kindles.</p><p>All generous social irradiations spring from science, letters, arts,education. Make men, make men. Give them light that they may warm you.Sooner or later the splendid question of universal education will presentitself with the irresistible authority of the absolute truth; and then,those who govern under the superintendence of the French idea will have tomake this choice; the children of France or the gamins of Paris; flames inthe light or will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps in the gloom.</p><p>The gamin expresses Paris, and Paris expresses the world.</p><p>For Paris is a total. Paris is the ceiling of the human race. The whole ofthis prodigious city is a foreshortening of dead manners and livingmanners. He who sees Paris thinks he sees the bottom of all history withheaven and constellations in the intervals. Paris has a capital, theTown-Hall, a Parthenon, Notre-Dame, a Mount Aventine, the FaubourgSaint-Antoine, an Asinarium, the Sorbonne, a Pantheon, the Pantheon, a ViaSacra, the Boulevard des Italiens, a temple of the winds, opinion; and itreplaces the Gemoniæ by ridicule. Its <i>majo</i> is called &ldquo;faraud,&rdquo; itsTransteverin is the man of the faubourgs, its <i>hammal</i> is themarket-porter, its lazzarone is the pègre, its cockney is the native ofGhent. Everything that exists elsewhere exists at Paris. The fishwoman ofDumarsais can retort on the herb-seller of Euripides, the discobolsVejanus lives again in the Forioso, the tight-rope dancer. TherapontigonusMiles could walk arm in arm with Vadeboncœur the grenadier,Damasippus the second-hand dealer would be happy among bric-à-bracmerchants, Vincennes could grasp Socrates in its fist as just as Agoracould imprison Diderot, Grimod de la Reynière discovered larded roastbeef, as Curtillus invented roast hedgehog, we see the trapeze whichfigures in Plautus reappear under the vault of the Arc of l&rsquo;Etoile, thesword-eater of Pœcilus encountered by Apuleius is a sword-swallower on thePont-Neuf, the nephew of Rameau and Curculio the parasite make a pair,Ergasilus could get himself presented to Cambacères by d&rsquo;Aigrefeuille; thefour dandies of Rome: Alcesimarchus, Phœdromus, Diabolus, and Argyrippus,descend from Courtille in Labatut&rsquo;s posting-chaise; Aulus Gellius wouldhalt no longer in front of Congrio than would Charles Nodier in front ofPunchinello; Marto is not a tigress, but Pardalisca was not a dragon;Pantolabus the wag jeers in the Café Anglais at Nomentanus the fast liver,Hermogenus is a tenor in the Champs-Élysées, and round him, Thracius thebeggar, clad like Bobèche, takes up a collection; the bore who stops youby the button of your coat in the Tuileries makes you repeat after a lapseof two thousand years Thesprion&rsquo;s apostrophe: <i>Quis properantem meprehendit pallio? </i> The wine on Surêne is a parody of the wine of Alba,the red border of Desaugiers forms a balance to the great cutting ofBalatro, Père-Lachaise exhales beneath nocturnal rains the same gleams as theEsquiliæ, and the grave of the poor bought for five years, is certainlythe equivalent of the slave&rsquo;s hived coffin.</p><p>Seek something that Paris has not. The vat of Trophonius contains nothingthat is not in Mesmer&rsquo;s tub; Ergaphilas lives again in Cagliostro; theBrahmin Vâsaphantâ become incarnate in the Comte de Saint-Germain; thecemetery of Saint-Médard works quite as good miracles as the Mosque ofOumoumié at Damascus.</p><p>Paris has an Æsop-Mayeux, and a Canidia, Mademoiselle Lenormand. It isterrified, like Delphos at the fulgurating realities of the vision; itmakes tables turn as Dodona did tripods. It places the grisette on thethrone, as Rome placed the courtesan there; and, taking it altogether, ifLouis XV. is worse than Claudian, Madame Dubarry is better than Messalina.Paris combines in an unprecedented type, which has existed and which wehave elbowed, Grecian nudity, the Hebraic ulcer, and the Gascon pun. Itmingles Diogenes, Job, and Jack-pudding, dresses up a spectre in oldnumbers of the <i>Constitutional</i>, and makes Chodruc Duclos.</p><p>Although Plutarch says: <i>the tyrant never grows old</i>, Rome, underSylla as under Domitian, resigned itself and willingly put water in itswine. The Tiber was a Lethe, if the rather doctrinary eulogium made of itby Varus Vibiscus is to be credited: <i>Contra Gracchos Tiberim habemus,Bibere Tiberim, id est seditionem oblivisci</i>. Paris drinks a millionlitres of water a day, but that does not prevent it from occasionallybeating the general alarm and ringing the tocsin.</p><p>With that exception, Paris is amiable. It accepts everything royally; itis not too particular about its Venus; its Callipyge is Hottentot;provided that it is made to laugh, it condones; ugliness cheers it,deformity provokes it to laughter, vice diverts it; be eccentric and youmay be an eccentric; even hypocrisy, that supreme cynicism, does notdisgust it; it is so literary that it does not hold its nose beforeBasile, and is no more scandalized by the prayer of Tartuffe than Horacewas repelled by the &ldquo;hiccup&rdquo; of Priapus. No trait of the universal face islacking in the profile of Paris. The bal Mabile is not the polymnia danceof the Janiculum, but the dealer in ladies&rsquo; wearing apparel there devoursthe lorette with her eyes, exactly as the procuress Staphyla lay in waitfor the virgin Planesium. The Barrière du Combat is not the Coliseum, butpeople are as ferocious there as though Cæsar were looking on. The Syrianhostess has more grace than Mother Saguet, but, if Virgil haunted theRoman wine-shop, David d&rsquo;Angers, Balzac and Charlet have sat at the tablesof Parisian taverns. Paris reigns. Geniuses flash forth there, the redtails prosper there. Adonaï passes on his chariot with its twelve wheelsof thunder and lightning; Silenus makes his entry there on his ass. ForSilenus read Ramponneau.</p><p>Paris is the synonym of Cosmos, Paris is Athens, Sybaris, Jerusalem,Pantin. All civilizations are there in an abridged form, all barbarismsalso. Paris would greatly regret it if it had not a guillotine.</p><p>A little of the Place de Grève is a good thing. What would all thateternal festival be without this seasoning? Our laws are wisely provided,and thanks to them, this blade drips on this Shrove Tuesday.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0157" id="link2HCH0157"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;TO SCOFF, TO REIGN</h3><p>There is no limit to Paris. No city has had that domination whichsometimes derides those whom it subjugates. To please you, O Athenians!exclaimed Alexander. Paris makes more than the law, it makes the fashion;Paris sets more than the fashion, it sets the routine. Paris may bestupid, if it sees fit; it sometimes allows itself this luxury; then theuniverse is stupid in company with it; then Paris awakes, rubs its eyes,says: &ldquo;How stupid I am!&rdquo; and bursts out laughing in the face of the humanrace. What a marvel is such a city! it is a strange thing that thisgrandioseness and this burlesque should be amicable neighbors, that allthis majesty should not be thrown into disorder by all this parody, andthat the same mouth can to-day blow into the trump of the Judgment Day,and to-morrow into the reed-flute! Paris has a sovereign joviality. Itsgayety is of the thunder and its farce holds a sceptre.</p><p>Its tempest sometimes proceeds from a grimace. Its explosions, its days,its masterpieces, its prodigies, its epics, go forth to the bounds of theuniverse, and so also do its cock-and-bull stories. Its laugh is the mouthof a volcano which spatters the whole earth. Its jests are sparks. Itimposes its caricatures as well as its ideal on people; the highestmonuments of human civilization accept its ironies and lend their eternityto its mischievous pranks. It is superb; it has a prodigious 14th of July,which delivers the globe; it forces all nations to take the oath oftennis; its night of the 4th of August dissolves in three hours a thousandyears of feudalism; it makes of its logic the muscle of unanimous will; itmultiplies itself under all sorts of forms of the sublime; it fills withits light Washington, Kosciusko, Bolivar, Bozzaris, Riego, Bem, Manin,Lopez, John Brown, Garibaldi; it is everywhere where the future is beinglighted up, at Boston in 1779, at the Isle de Léon in 1820, at Pesth in1848, at Palermo in 1860, it whispers the mighty countersign: Liberty, inthe ear of the American abolitionists grouped about the boat at Harper&rsquo;sFerry, and in the ear of the patriots of Ancona assembled in the shadow,to the Archi before the Gozzi inn on the seashore; it creates Canaris; itcreates Quiroga; it creates Pisacane; it irradiates the great on earth; itwas while proceeding whither its breath urge them, that Byron perished atMissolonghi, and that Mazet died at Barcelona; it is the tribune under thefeet of Mirabeau, and a crater under the feet of Robespierre; its books,its theatre, its art, its science, its literature, its philosophy, are themanuals of the human race; it has Pascal, Régnier, Corneille, Descartes,Jean-Jacques: Voltaire for all moments, Molière for all centuries; itmakes its language to be talked by the universal mouth, and that languagebecomes the word; it constructs in all minds the idea of progress, theliberating dogmas which it forges are for the generations trusty friends,and it is with the soul of its thinkers and its poets that all heroes ofall nations have been made since 1789; this does not prevent vagabondism,and that enormous genius which is called Paris, while transfiguring theworld by its light, sketches in charcoal Bouginier&rsquo;s nose on the wall ofthe temple of Theseus and writes <i>Credeville the thief</i> on thePyramids.</p><p>Paris is always showing its teeth; when it is not scolding it is laughing.</p><p>Such is Paris. The smoke of its roofs forms the ideas of the universe. Aheap of mud and stone, if you will, but, above all, a moral being. It ismore than great, it is immense. Why? Because it is daring.</p><p>To dare; that is the price of progress.</p><p>All sublime conquests are, more or less, the prizes of daring. In orderthat the Revolution should take place, it does not suffice thatMontesquieu should foresee it, that Diderot should preach it, thatBeaumarchais should announce it, that Condorcet should calculate it, thatArouet should prepare it, that Rousseau should premeditate it; it isnecessary that Danton should dare it.</p><p>The cry: <i>Audacity! </i> is a <i>Fiat lux</i>. It is necessary, for thesake of the forward march of the human race, that there should be proudlessons of courage permanently on the heights. Daring deeds dazzle historyand are one of man&rsquo;s great sources of light. The dawn dares when it rises.To attempt, to brave, to persist, to persevere, to be faithful to one&rsquo;sself, to grasp fate bodily, to astound catastrophe by the small amount offear that it occasions us, now to affront unjust power, again to insultdrunken victory, to hold one&rsquo;s position, to stand one&rsquo;s ground; that isthe example which nations need, that is the light which electrifies them.The same formidable lightning proceeds from the torch of Prometheus toCambronne&rsquo;s short pipe.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0158" id="link2HCH0158"></a>CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE FUTURE LATENT IN THE PEOPLE</h3><p>As for the Parisian populace, even when a man grown, it is always thestreet Arab; to paint the child is to paint the city; and it is for thatreason that we have studied this eagle in this arrant sparrow. It is inthe faubourgs, above all, we maintain, that the Parisian race appears;there is the pure blood; there is the true physiognomy; there this peopletoils and suffers, and suffering and toil are the two faces of man.

Would you turn their distress into a malediction? Cannot the lightpenetrate these masses? Let us return to that cry: Light! and let usobstinately persist therein! Light! Light! Who knows whether theseopacities will not become transparent? Are not revolutionstransfigurations? Come, philosophers, teach, enlighten, light up, thinkaloud, speak aloud, hasten joyously to the great sun, fraternize with thepublic place, announce the good news, spend your alphabets lavishly,proclaim rights, sing the Marseillaises, sow enthusiasms, tear greenboughs from the oaks.

Let us learn how to make use of that vast conflagrationof principles and virtues, which sparkles, bursts forth and quivers atcertain hours. These bare feet, these bare arms, these rags, theseignorances, these abjectnesses, these darknesses, may be employed in theconquest of the ideal.

This child was well muffled up in a pair ofman&rsquo;s trousers, but he did not get them from his father, and a woman&rsquo;schemise, but he did not get it from his mother. Some people or other hadclothed him in rags out of charity. Still, he had a father and a mother.But his father did not think of him, and his mother did not love him.</p><p>He was one of those children most deserving of pity, among all, one ofthose who have father and mother, and who are orphans nevertheless.</p><p>This child never felt so well as when he was in the street. The pavementswere less hard to him than his mother&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>His parents had despatched him into life with a kick.</p><p>He simply took flight.</p><p>He was a boisterous, pallid, nimble, wide-awake, jeering, lad, with avivacious but sickly air. He went and came, sang, played at hopscotch,scraped the gutters, stole a little, but, like cats and sparrows, gaylylaughed when he was called a rogue, and got angry when called a thief. Hehad no shelter, no bread, no fire, no love; but he was merry because hewas free.</p><p>When these poor creatures grow to be men, the millstones of the socialorder meet them and crush them, but so long as they are children, theyescape because of their smallness. The tiniest hole saves them.</p><p>Nevertheless, abandoned as this child was, it sometimes happened, everytwo or three months, that he said, &ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll go and see mamma!&rdquo; Then hequitted the boulevard, the Cirque, the Porte Saint-Martin, descended tothe quays, crossed the bridges, reached the suburbs, arrived at theSalpêtrière, and came to a halt, where? Precisely at that double number50-52 with which the reader is acquainted&mdash;at the Gorbeau hovel.</p><p>At that epoch, the hovel 50-52 generally deserted and eternally decoratedwith the placard: &ldquo;Chambers to let,&rdquo; chanced to be, a rare thing,inhabited by numerous individuals who, however, as is always the case inParis, had no connection with each other. All belonged to that indigentclass which begins to separate from the lowest of petty bourgeoisie instraitened circumstances, and which extends from misery to misery into thelowest depths of society down to those two beings in whom all the materialthings of civilization end, the sewer-man who sweeps up the mud, and therag-picker who collects scraps.</p><p>The &ldquo;principal lodger&rdquo; of Jean Valjean&rsquo;s day was dead and had beenreplaced by another exactly like her. I know not what philosopher hassaid: &ldquo;Old women are never lacking.&rdquo;</p><p>This new old woman was named Madame Bourgon, and had nothing remarkableabout her life except a dynasty of three paroquets, who had reigned insuccession over her soul.</p><p>The most miserable of those who inhabited the hovel were a family of fourpersons, consisting of father, mother, and two daughters, already wellgrown, all four of whom were lodged in the same attic, one of the cellswhich we have already mentioned.</p><p>At first sight, this family presented no very special feature except itsextreme destitution; the father, when he hired the chamber, had statedthat his name was Jondrette. Some time after his moving in, which hadborne a singular resemblance to <i>the entrance of nothing at all</i>, toborrow the memorable expression of the principal tenant, this Jondrettehad said to the woman, who, like her predecessor, was at the same timeportress and stair-sweeper: &ldquo;Mother So-and-So, if any one should chance tocome and inquire for a Pole or an Italian, or even a Spaniard, perchance,it is I.&rdquo;</p><p>This family was that of the merry barefoot boy. He arrived there and founddistress, and, what is still sadder, no smile; a cold hearth and coldhearts. When he entered, he was asked: &ldquo;Whence come you?&rdquo; He replied:&ldquo;From the street.&rdquo; When he went away, they asked him: &ldquo;Whither are yougoing?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;Into the streets.&rdquo; His mother said to him: &ldquo;What didyou come here for?&rdquo;</p><p>This child lived, in this absence of affection, like the pale plants whichspring up in cellars. It did not cause him suffering, and he blamed noone. He did not know exactly how a father and mother should be.</p><p>Nevertheless, his mother loved his sisters.</p><p>We have forgotten to mention, that on the Boulevard du Temple this childwas called Little Gavroche. Why was he called Little Gavroche?</p><p>Probably because his father&rsquo;s name was Jondrette.</p><p>It seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break thethread.</p><p>The chamber which the Jondrettes inhabited in the Gorbeau hovel was thelast at the end of the corridor.

Gillenormand, and who mention him with complaisance.This good man was old when they were young. This silhouette has not yetentirely disappeared&mdash;for those who regard with melancholy that vagueswarm of shadows which is called the past&mdash;from the labyrinth ofstreets in the vicinity of the Temple to which, under Louis XIV., thenames of all the provinces of France were appended exactly as in our day,the streets of the new Tivoli quarter have received the names of all thecapitals of Europe; a progression, by the way, in which progress isvisible.</p><p>M. Gillenormand, who was as much alive as possible in 1831, was one ofthose men who had become curiosities to be viewed, simply because theyhave lived a long time, and who are strange because they formerlyresembled everybody, and now resemble nobody. He was a peculiar old man,and in very truth, a man of another age, the real, complete and ratherhaughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century, who wore his good, oldbourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their marquisates. Hewas over ninety years of age, his walk was erect, he talked loudly, sawclearly, drank neat, ate, slept, and snored. He had all thirty-two of histeeth. He only wore spectacles when he read. He was of an amorousdisposition, but declared that, for the last ten years, he had wholly anddecidedly renounced women. He could no longer please, he said; he did notadd: &ldquo;I am too old,&rdquo; but: &ldquo;I am too poor.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;If I were not ruined&mdash;Héée!&rdquo; All he had left, in fact, was an income of about fifteen thousand francs.His dream was to come into an inheritance and to have a hundred thousandlivres income for mistresses. He did not belong, as the reader willperceive, to that puny variety of octogenaries who, like M. de Voltaire,have been dying all their life; his was no longevity of a cracked pot;this jovial old man had always had good health. He was superficial, rapid,easily angered. He flew into a passion at everything, generally quitecontrary to all reason. When contradicted, he raised his cane; he beatpeople as he had done in the great century. He had a daughter over fiftyyears of age, and unmarried, whom he chastised severely with his tongue,when in a rage, and whom he would have liked to whip. She seemed to him tobe eight years old. He boxed his servants&rsquo; ears soundly, and said: &ldquo;Ah!carogne!&rdquo; One of his oaths was: &ldquo;By the pantoufloche of thepantouflochade!&rdquo; He had singular freaks of tranquillity; he had himselfshaved every day by a barber who had been mad and who detested him, beingjealous of M. Gillenormand on account of his wife, a pretty and coquettishbarberess. M. Gillenormand admired his own discernment in all things, anddeclared that he was extremely sagacious; here is one of his sayings: &ldquo;Ihave, in truth, some penetration; I am able to say when a flea bites me,from what woman it came.&rdquo;</p><p>The words which he uttered the most frequently were: <i>the sensible man</i>,and <i>nature</i>. He did not give to this last word the grand acceptationwhich our epoch has accorded to it, but he made it enter, after his ownfashion, into his little chimney-corner satires: &ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;inorder that civilization may have a little of everything, gives it evenspecimens of its amusing barbarism. Europe possesses specimens of Asia andAfrica on a small scale. The cat is a drawing-room tiger, the lizard is apocket crocodile. The dancers at the opera are pink female savages.

He owned thehouse. This house has since been demolished and rebuilt, and the numberhas probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which thestreets of Paris undergo. He occupied an ancient and vast apartment on thefirst floor, between street and gardens, furnished to the very ceilingswith great Gobelins and Beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes;the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were repeated in miniature onthe armchairs. He enveloped his bed in a vast, nine-leaved screen ofCoromandel lacquer. Long, full curtains hung from the windows, and formedgreat, broken folds that were very magnificent. The garden situatedimmediately under his windows was attached to that one of them whichformed the angle, by means of a staircase twelve or fifteen steps long,which the old gentleman ascended and descended with great agility. Inaddition to a library adjoining his chamber, he had a boudoir of which hethought a great deal, a gallant and elegant retreat, with magnificenthangings of straw, with a pattern of flowers and fleurs-de-lys made on thegalleys of Louis XIV. and ordered of his convicts by M. de Vivonne for hismistress. M. Gillenormand had inherited it from a grim maternalgreat-aunt, who had died a centenarian. He had had two wives. His mannerswere something between those of the courtier, which he had never been, andthe lawyer, which he might have been. He was gay, and caressing when hehad a mind. In his youth he had been one of those men who are alwaysdeceived by their wives and never by their mistresses, because they are,at the same time, the most sullen of husbands and the most charming oflovers in existence. He was a connoisseur of painting. He had in hischamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom, painted by Jordaens,executed with great dashes of the brush, with millions of details, in aconfused and hap-hazard manner. M. Gillenormand&rsquo;s attire was not the habitof Louis XIV. nor yet that of Louis XVI.; it was that of the Incroyablesof the Directory. He had thought himself young up to that period and hadfollowed the fashions. His coat was of light-weight cloth with voluminousrevers, a long swallow-tail and large steel buttons. With this he woreknee-breeches and buckle shoes. He always thrust his hands into his fobs.He said authoritatively: &ldquo;The French Revolution is a heap of blackguards.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0162" id="link2HCH0162"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;LUC-ESPRIT</h3><p>At the age of sixteen, one evening at the opera, he had had the honor tobe stared at through opera-glasses by two beauties at the same time&mdash;ripeand celebrated beauties then, and sung by Voltaire, the Camargo and theSallé. Caught between two fires, he had beaten a heroic retreat towards alittle dancer, a young girl named Nahenry, who was sixteen like himself,obscure as a cat, and with whom he was in love. He abounded in memories.He was accustomed to exclaim: &ldquo;How pretty she was&mdash;thatGuimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the last time I saw her at Longchamps,her hair curled in sustained sentiments, with her come-and-see ofturquoises, her gown of the color of persons newly arrived, and her littleagitation muff!&rdquo; He had worn in his young manhood a waistcoat ofNain-Londrin, which he was fond of talking about effusively. &ldquo;I wasdressed like a Turk of the Levant Levantin,&rdquo; said he. Madame de Boufflers,having seen him by chance when he was twenty, had described him as &ldquo;acharming fool.&rdquo; He was horrified by all the names which he saw in politicsand in power, regarding them as vulgar and bourgeois. He read thejournals, the <i>newspapers, the gazettes</i> as he said, stiflingoutbursts of laughter the while. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what people these are!Corbière! Humann! Casimir Périer! There&rsquo;s a minister for you! I canimagine this in a journal: &lsquo;M. Gillenorman, minister!&rsquo; that would be afarce. Well! They are so stupid that it would pass&rdquo;; he merrily calledeverything by its name, whether decent or indecent, and did not restrainhimself in the least before ladies. He uttered coarse speeches,obscenities, and filth with a certain tranquillity and lack ofastonishment which was elegant. It was in keeping with theunceremoniousness of his century. It is to be noted that the age ofperiphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose. His god-father hadpredicted that he would turn out a man of genius, and had bestowed on himthese two significant names: Luc-Esprit.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0163" id="link2HCH0163"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;A CENTENARIAN ASPIRANT</h3><p>He had taken prizes in his boyhood at the College of Moulins, where he wasborn, and he had been crowned by the hand of the Duc de Nivernais, whom hecalled the Duc de Nevers. Neither the Convention, nor the death of LouisXVI., nor the Napoleon, nor the return of the Bourbons, nor anything elsehad been able to efface the memory of this crowning. <i>The Duc de Nevers</i>was, in his eyes, the great figure of the century. &ldquo;What a charming grandseigneur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and what a fine air he had with his blue ribbon!&rdquo;</p><p>In the eyes of M. Gillenormand, Catherine the Second had made reparationfor the crime of the partition of Poland by purchasing, for three thousandroubles, the secret of the elixir of gold, from Bestucheff. He grewanimated on this subject: &ldquo;The elixir of gold,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;the yellowdye of Bestucheff, General Lamotte&rsquo;s drops, in the eighteenth century,&mdash;thiswas the great remedy for the catastrophes of love, the panacea againstVenus, at one louis the half-ounce phial. Louis XV. sent two hundredphials of it to the Pope.&rdquo; He would have been greatly irritated and thrownoff his balance, had any one told him that the elixir of gold is nothingbut the perchloride of iron. M. Gillenormand adored the Bourbons, and hada horror of 1789; he was forever narrating in what manner he had savedhimself during the Terror, and how he had been obliged to display a vastdeal of gayety and cleverness in order to escape having his head cut off.If any young man ventured to pronounce an eulogium on the Republic in hispresence, he turned purple and grew so angry that he was on the point ofswooning. He sometimes alluded to his ninety years, and said, &ldquo;I hope thatI shall not see ninety-three twice.&rdquo; On these occasions, he hinted topeople that he meant to live to be a hundred.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0164" id="link2HCH0164"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;BASQUE AND NICOLETTE</h3><p>He had theories. Here is one of them: &ldquo;When a man is passionately fond ofwomen, and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares but little, who ishomely, cross, legitimate, with plenty of rights, perched on the code, andjealous at need, there is but one way of extricating himself from thequandry and of procuring peace, and that is to let his wife control thepurse-strings. This abdication sets him free. Then his wife busiesherself, grows passionately fond of handling coin, gets her fingerscovered with verdigris in the process, undertakes the education ofhalf-share tenants and the training of farmers, convokes lawyers, presidesover notaries, harangues scriveners, visits limbs of the law, followslawsuits, draws up leases, dictates contracts, feels herself thesovereign, sells, buys, regulates, promises and compromises, binds fastand annuls, yields, concedes and retrocedes, arranges, disarranges,hoards, lavishes; she commits follies, a supreme and personal delight, andthat consoles her. While her husband disdains her, she has thesatisfaction of ruining her husband.&rdquo; This theory M. Gillenormand hadhimself applied, and it had become his history. His wife&mdash;the secondone&mdash;had administered his fortune in such a manner that, one fineday, when M. Gillenormand found himself a widower, there remained to himjust sufficient to live on, by sinking nearly the whole of it in anannuity of fifteen thousand francs, three-quarters of which would expirewith him. He had not hesitated on this point, not being anxious to leave aproperty behind him. Besides, he had noticed that patrimonies are subjectto adventures, and, for instance, become <i>national property</i>; he hadbeen present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents, and he had nogreat faith in the Great Book of the Public Debt. &ldquo;All that&rsquo;s the RueQuincampois!&rdquo; he said. His house in the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire belongedto him, as we have already stated. He had two servants, &ldquo;a male and afemale.&rdquo; When a servant entered his establishment, M. Gillenormandre-baptized him. He bestowed on the men the name of their province:Nîmois, Comtois, Poitevin, Picard. His last valet was a big, foundered,short-winded fellow of fifty-five, who was incapable of running twentypaces; but, as he had been born at Bayonne, M. Gillenormand called him <i>Basque</i>.All the female servants in his house were called Nicolette (even theMagnon, of whom we shall hear more farther on). One day, a haughty cook, acordon bleu, of the lofty race of porters, presented herself. &ldquo;How muchwages do you want a month?&rdquo; asked M. Gillenormand. &ldquo;Thirty francs.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whatis your name?&rdquo; &ldquo;Olympie.&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall have fifty francs, and you shall becalled Nicolette.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0165" id="link2HCH0165"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;IN WHICH MAGNON AND HER TWO CHILDREN ARE SEEN</h3><p>With M. Gillenormand, sorrow was converted into wrath; he was furious atbeing in despair. He had all sorts of prejudices and took all sorts ofliberties. One of the facts of which his exterior relief and his internalsatisfaction was composed, was, as we have just hinted, that he hadremained a brisk spark, and that he passed energetically for such. This hecalled having &ldquo;royal renown.&rdquo; This royal renown sometimes drew down uponhim singular windfalls. One day, there was brought to him in a basket, asthough it had been a basket of oysters, a stout, newly born boy, who wasyelling like the deuce, and duly wrapped in swaddling-clothes, which aservant-maid, dismissed six months previously, attributed to him. M.Gillenormand had, at that time, fully completed his eighty-fourth year.Indignation and uproar in the establishment. And whom did that bold hussythink she could persuade to believe that? What audacity! What anabominable calumny! M. Gillenormand himself was not at all enraged. Hegazed at the brat with the amiable smile of a good man who is flattered bythe calumny, and said in an aside: &ldquo;Well, what now? What&rsquo;s the matter? Youare finely taken aback, and really, you are excessively ignorant. M. leDuc d&rsquo;Angoulême, the bastard of his Majesty Charles IX., married a sillyjade of fifteen when he was eighty-five; M. Virginal, Marquis d&rsquo;Alluye,brother to the Cardinal de Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, had, at theage of eighty-three, by the maid of Madame la Présidente Jacquin, a son, areal child of love, who became a Chevalier of Malta and a counsellor ofstate; one of the great men of this century, the Abbé Tabaraud, is the sonof a man of eighty-seven. There is nothing out of the ordinary in thesethings. And then, the Bible! Upon that I declare that this littlegentleman is none of mine. Let him be taken care of. It is not his fault.&rdquo; This manner of procedure was good-tempered. The woman, whose name wasMagnon, sent him another parcel in the following year. It was a boy again.Thereupon, M. Gillenormand capitulated. He sent the two brats back totheir mother, promising to pay eighty francs a month for theirmaintenance, on the condition that the said mother would not do so anymore. He added: &ldquo;I insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well. Ishall go to see them from time to time.&rdquo; And this he did. He had had abrother who was a priest, and who had been rector of the Academy ofPoitiers for three and thirty years, and had died at seventy-nine. &ldquo;I losthim young,&rdquo; said he. This brother, of whom but little memory remains, wasa peaceable miser, who, being a priest, thought himself bound to bestowalms on the poor whom he met, but he never gave them anything except bador demonetized sous, thereby discovering a means of going to hell by wayof paradise. As for M. Gillenormand the elder, he never haggled over hisalms-giving, but gave gladly and nobly. He was kindly, abrupt, charitable,and if he had been rich, his turn of mind would have been magnificent. Hedesired that all which concerned him should be done in a grand manner,even his rogueries. One day, having been cheated by a business man in amatter of inheritance, in a gross and apparent manner, he uttered thissolemn exclamation: &ldquo;That was indecently done! I am really ashamed of thispilfering. Everything has degenerated in this century, even the rascals.Morbleu! this is not the way to rob a man of my standing. I am robbed asthough in a forest, but badly robbed. <i>Silvæ sint consule dignæ! </i>&rdquo; He had had two wives, as we have already mentioned; by the first he hadhad a daughter, who had remained unmarried, and by the second anotherdaughter, who had died at about the age of thirty, who had wedded, throughlove, or chance, or otherwise, a soldier of fortune who had served in thearmies of the Republic and of the Empire, who had won the cross atAusterlitz and had been made colonel at Waterloo. <i>&ldquo;He is the disgraceof my family,&rdquo; </i> said the old bourgeois. He took an immense amount ofsnuff, and had a particularly graceful manner of plucking at his laceruffle with the back of one hand. He believed very little in God.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0166" id="link2HCH0166"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;RULE: RECEIVE NO ONE EXCEPT IN THE EVENING</h3><p>Such was M.

Theprincipal one, and that which was invariable, was to keep his doorabsolutely closed during the day, and never to receive any one whateverexcept in the evening. He dined at five o&rsquo;clock, and after that his doorwas open. That had been the fashion of his century, and he would notswerve from it. &ldquo;The day is vulgar,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and deserves only a closedshutter.

Gillenormand&rsquo;s two daughters. They had come intothe world ten years apart. In their youth they had borne very littleresemblance to each other, either in character or countenance, and hadalso been as little like sisters to each other as possible. The youngesthad a charming soul, which turned towards all that belongs to the light,was occupied with flowers, with verses, with music, which fluttered awayinto glorious space, enthusiastic, ethereal, and was wedded from her veryyouth, in ideal, to a vague and heroic figure. The elder had also herchimera; she espied in the azure some very wealthy purveyor, a contractor,a splendidly stupid husband, a million made man, or even a prefect; thereceptions of the Prefecture, an usher in the antechamber with a chain onhis neck, official balls, the harangues of the town-hall, to be &ldquo;Madame laPréfète,&rdquo;&mdash;all this had created a whirlwind in her imagination. Thusthe two sisters strayed, each in her own dream, at the epoch when theywere young girls. Both had wings, the one like an angel, the other like agoose.</p><p>No ambition is ever fully realized, here below at least. No paradisebecomes terrestrial in our day. The younger wedded the man of her dreams,but she died. The elder did not marry at all.</p><p>At the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we arerelating, she was an antique virtue, an incombustible prude, with one ofthe sharpest noses, and one of the most obtuse minds that it is possibleto see. A characteristic detail; outside of her immediate family, no onehad ever known her first name. She was called <i>MademoiselleGillenormand, the elder</i>.</p><p>In the matter of <i>cant</i>, Mademoiselle Gillenormand could have givenpoints to a miss. Her modesty was carried to the other extreme ofblackness. She cherished a frightful memory of her life; one day, a manhad beheld her garter.</p><p>Age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty. Her guimpe wasnever sufficiently opaque, and never ascended sufficiently high. Shemultiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking. Thepeculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels in proportion asthe fortress is the less menaced.</p><p>Nevertheless, let him who can explain these antique mysteries ofinnocence, she allowed an officer of the Lancers, her grand nephew, namedThéodule, to embrace her without displeasure.</p><p>In spite of this favored Lancer, the label: <i>Prude</i>, under which wehave classed her, suited her to absolute perfection. MademoiselleGillenormand was a sort of twilight soul. Prudery is a demi-virtue and ademi-vice.</p><p>To prudery she added bigotry, a well-assorted lining. She belonged to thesociety of the Virgin, wore a white veil on certain festivals, mumbledspecial orisons, revered &ldquo;the holy blood,&rdquo; venerated &ldquo;the sacred heart,&rdquo; remained for hours in contemplation before a rococo-jesuit altar in achapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful, andthere allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble, and throughgreat rays of gilded wood.</p><p>She had a chapel friend, an ancient virgin like herself, namedMademoiselle Vaubois, who was a positive blockhead, and beside whomMademoiselle Gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle. Beyond theAgnus Dei and Ave Maria, Mademoiselle Vaubois had no knowledge of anythingexcept of the different ways of making preserves. Mademoiselle Vaubois,perfect in her style, was the ermine of stupidity without a single spot ofintelligence.</p><p>Let us say it plainly, Mademoiselle Gillenormand had gained rather thanlost as she grew older. This is the case with passive natures. She hadnever been malicious, which is relative kindness; and then, years wearaway the angles, and the softening which comes with time had come to her.She was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not herselfknow the secret. There breathed from her whole person the stupor of a lifethat was finished, and which had never had a beginning.</p><p>She kept house for her father. M. Gillenormand had his daughter near him,as we have seen that Monseigneur Bienvenu had his sister with him. Thesehouseholds comprised of an old man and an old spinster are not rare, andalways have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning on each otherfor support.</p><p>There was also in this house, between this elderly spinster and this oldman, a child, a little boy, who was always trembling and mute in thepresence of M. Gillenormand. M. Gillenormand never addressed this childexcept in a severe voice, and sometimes, with uplifted cane: &ldquo;Here, sir!rascal, scoundrel, come here!&mdash;Answer me, you scamp! Just let me seeyou, you good-for-nothing!&rdquo; etc., etc. He idolized him.</p><p>This was his grandson.

Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni, he had frequented manyvery good and very aristocratic salons. Although a bourgeois, M.Gillenormand was received in society. As he had a double measure of wit,in the first place, that which was born with him, and secondly, that whichwas attributed to him, he was even sought out and made much of. He neverwent anywhere except on condition of being the chief person there. Thereare people who will have influence at any price, and who will have otherpeople busy themselves over them; when they cannot be oracles, they turnwags. M. Gillenormand was not of this nature; his domination in theRoyalist salons which he frequented cost his self-respect nothing. He wasan oracle everywhere. It had happened to him to hold his own against M. deBonald, and even against M. Bengy-Puy-Vallée.</p><p>About 1817, he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in hisown neighborhood, in the Rue Férou, with Madame la Baronne de T., a worthyand respectable person, whose husband had been Ambassador of France toBerlin under Louis XVI. Baron de T., who, during his lifetime, had gonevery passionately into ecstasies and magnetic visions, had died bankrupt,during the emigration, leaving, as his entire fortune, some very curiousMemoirs about Mesmer and his tub, in ten manuscript volumes, bound in redmorocco and gilded on the edges. Madame de T. had not published thememoirs, out of pride, and maintained herself on a meagre income which hadsurvived no one knew how.</p><p>Madame de T. lived far from the Court; &ldquo;a very mixed society,&rdquo; as shesaid, in a noble isolation, proud and poor. A few friends assembled twicea week about her widowed hearth, and these constituted a purely Royalistsalon. They sipped tea there, and uttered groans or cries of horror at thecentury, the charter, the Bonapartists, the prostitution of the blueribbon, or the Jacobinism of Louis XVIII., according as the wind veeredtowards elegy or dithyrambs; and they spoke in low tones of the hopeswhich were presented by Monsieur, afterwards Charles X.</p><p>The songs of the fishwomen, in which Napoleon was called <i>Nicolas</i>,were received there with transports of joy. Duchesses, the most delicateand charming women in the world, went into ecstasies over couplets likethe following, addressed to &ldquo;the federates&rdquo;:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Refoncez dans vos culottes<br/>Le bout d&rsquo; chemis&rsquo; qui vous pend.<br/>Qu&rsquo;on n&rsquo; dis&rsquo; pas qu&rsquo; les patriotes<br/>Ont arboré l&rsquo; drapeau blanc?<a href="#linknote-20" name="linknoteref-20" id="linknoteref-20">20</a></p><p class="noindent">There they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible,with innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous, withquatrains, with distiches even; thus, upon the Dessolles ministry, amoderate cabinet, of which MM. Decazes and Deserre were members:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Pour raffermir le trône ébranlé sur sa base,<br/>Il faut changer de sol, et de serre et de case.<a href="#linknote-21" name="linknoteref-21" id="linknoteref-21">21</a></p><p class="noindent">Or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers, &ldquo;an abominably Jacobinchamber,&rdquo; and from this list they combined alliances of names, in such amanner as to form, for example, phrases like the following: <i>Damas.Sabran. Gouvion-Saint-Cyr</i>.&mdash;All this was done merrily. In thatsociety, they parodied the Revolution. They used I know not what desiresto give point to the same wrath in inverse sense. They sang their little<i>Ça ira: </i>&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Ah! ça ira ça ira ça ira!<br/>Les Bonapartistes à la lanterne!</p><p class="noindent">Songs are like the guillotine; they chop away indifferently, to-day thishead, to-morrow that. It is only a variation.</p><p>In the Fualdès affair, which belongs to this epoch, 1816, they took partfor Bastide and Jausion, because Fualdès was &ldquo;a Buonapartist.&rdquo; Theydesignated the liberals as f<i>riends and brothers</i>; this constitutedthe most deadly insult.</p><p>Like certain church towers, Madame de T.&rsquo;s salon had two cocks. One ofthem was M. Gillenormand, the other was Comte de Lamothe-Valois, of whomit was whispered about, with a sort of respect: &ldquo;Do you know? That is theLamothe of the affair of the necklace.&rdquo; These singular amnesties do occurin parties.</p><p>Let us add the following: in the bourgeoisie, honored situations decaythrough too easy relations; one must beware whom one admits; in the sameway that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who are cold,there is a diminution of consideration in the approach of despisedpersons. The ancient society of the upper classes held themselves abovethis law, as above every other. Marigny, the brother of the Pompadour, hadhis entry with M. le Prince de Soubise. In spite of? No, because. DuBarry, the god-father of the Vaubernier, was very welcome at the house ofM. le Maréchal de Richelieu. This society is Olympus. Mercury and thePrince de Guémenée are at home there. A thief is admitted there, providedhe be a god.</p><p>The Comte de Lamothe, who, in 1815, was an old man seventy-five years ofage, had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententiousair, his cold and angular face, his perfectly polished manners, his coatbuttoned up to his cravat, and his long legs always crossed in long,flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna. His face was the same color ashis trousers.</p><p>This M. de Lamothe was &ldquo;held in consideration&rdquo; in this salon on account ofhis &ldquo;celebrity&rdquo; and, strange to say, though true, because of his name ofValois.</p><p>As for M. Gillenormand, his consideration was of absolutely first-ratequality. He had, in spite of his levity, and without its interfering inany way with his dignity, a certain manner about him which was imposing,dignified, honest, and lofty, in a bourgeois fashion; and his great ageadded to it. One is not a century with impunity. The years finally producearound a head a venerable dishevelment.</p><p>In addition to this, he said things which had the genuine sparkle of theold rock. Thus, when the King of Prussia, after having restored LouisXVIII., came to pay the latter a visit under the name of the Count deRuppin, he was received by the descendant of Louis XIV. somewhat as thoughhe had been the Marquis de Brandebourg, and with the most delicateimpertinence. M. Gillenormand approved: &ldquo;All kings who are not the King ofFrance,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are provincial kings.&rdquo; One day, the following questionwas put and the following answer returned in his presence: &ldquo;To what wasthe editor of the <i>Courrier Français</i> condemned?&rdquo; &ldquo;To be suspended.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Sus</i> is superfluous,&rdquo; observed M. Gillenormand.<ahref="#linknote-22" name="linknoteref-22" id="linknoteref-22">22</a>Remarks of this nature found a situation.</p><p>At the Te Deum on the anniversary of the return of the Bourbons, he said,on seeing M. de Talleyrand pass by: &ldquo;There goes his Excellency the EvilOne.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter, that tallmademoiselle, who was over forty and looked fifty, and by a handsomelittle boy of seven years, white, rosy, fresh, with happy and trustingeyes, who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmuraround him: &ldquo;How handsome he is! What a pity! Poor child!&rdquo; This child wasthe one of whom we dropped a word a while ago. He was called &ldquo;poor child,&rdquo; because he had for a father &ldquo;a brigand of the Loire.&rdquo;</p><p>This brigand of the Loire was M. Gillenormand&rsquo;s son-in-law, who hasalready been mentioned, and whom M. Gillenormand called &ldquo;the disgrace ofhis family.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0169" id="link2HCH0169"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;ONE OF THE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCH</h3><p>Any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of Vernon at thisepoch, and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge,which will soon be succeeded, let us hope, by some hideous iron cablebridge, might have observed, had he dropped his eyes over the parapet, aman about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap, and trousers and awaistcoat of coarse gray cloth, to which something yellow which had been ared ribbon, was sewn, shod with wooden sabots, tanned by the sun, his facenearly black and his hair nearly white, a large scar on his forehead whichran down upon his cheek, bowed, bent, prematurely aged, who walked nearlyevery day, hoe and sickle in hand, in one of those compartments surroundedby walls which abut on the bridge, and border the left bank of the Seinelike a chain of terraces, charming enclosures full of flowers of which onecould say, were they much larger: &ldquo;these are gardens,&rdquo; and were they alittle smaller: &ldquo;these are bouquets.&rdquo; All these enclosures abut upon theriver at one end, and on a house at the other. The man in the waistcoatand the wooden shoes of whom we have just spoken, inhabited the smallestof these enclosures and the most humble of these houses about 1817. Helived there alone and solitary, silently and poorly, with a woman who wasneither young nor old, neither homely nor pretty, neither a peasant nor abourgeoise, who served him. The plot of earth which he called his gardenwas celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which hecultivated there. These flowers were his occupation.</p><p>By dint of labor, of perseverance, of attention, and of buckets of water,he had succeeded in creating after the Creator, and he had inventedcertain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been forgotten bynature. He was ingenious; he had forestalled Soulange Bodin in theformation of little clumps of earth of heath mould, for the cultivation ofrare and precious shrubs from America and China. He was in his alleys fromthe break of day, in summer, planting, cutting, hoeing, watering, walkingamid his flowers with an air of kindness, sadness, and sweetness,sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful for hours, listening to thesong of a bird in the trees, the babble of a child in a house, or with hiseyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of grass, of which thesun made a carbuncle. His table was very plain, and he drank more milkthan wine. A child could make him give way, and his servant scolded him.He was so timid that he seemed shy, he rarely went out, and he saw no onebut the poor people who tapped at his pane and his curé, the Abbé Mabeuf,a good old man. Nevertheless, if the inhabitants of the town, orstrangers, or any chance comers, curious to see his tulips, rang at hislittle cottage, he opened his door with a smile. He was the &ldquo;brigand ofthe Loire.&rdquo;</p><p>Any one who had, at the same time, read military memoirs, biographies, the<i>Moniteur</i>, and the bulletins of the grand army, would have beenstruck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency, the name ofGeorges Pontmercy. When very young, this Georges Pontmercy had been asoldier in Saintonge&rsquo;s regiment. The revolution broke out. Saintonge&rsquo;sregiment formed a part of the army of the Rhine; for the old regiments ofthe monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of themonarchy, and were only divided into brigades in 1794. Pontmercy fought atSpire, at Worms, at Neustadt, at Turkheim, at Alzey, at Mayence, where hewas one of the two hundred who formed Houchard&rsquo;s rearguard. It was thetwelfth to hold its ground against the corps of the Prince of Hesse,behind the old rampart of Andernach, and only rejoined the main body ofthe army when the enemy&rsquo;s cannon had opened a breach from the cord of theparapet to the foot of the glacis. He was under Kléber at Marchiennes andat the battle of Mont-Palissel, where a ball from a biscaïen broke hisarm. Then he passed to the frontier of Italy, and was one of the thirtygrenadiers who defended the Col de Tende with Joubert. Joubert wasappointed its adjutant-general, and Pontmercy sub-lieutenant. Pontmercywas by Berthier&rsquo;s side in the midst of the grape-shot of that day at Lodiwhich caused Bonaparte to say: &ldquo;Berthier has been cannoneer, cavalier, andgrenadier.&rdquo; He beheld his old general, Joubert, fall at Novi, at themoment when, with uplifted sabre, he was shouting: &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; Having beenembarked with his company in the exigencies of the campaign, on board apinnace which was proceeding from Genoa to some obscure port on the coast,he fell into a wasps&rsquo;-nest of seven or eight English vessels. The Genoesecommander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea, to hide the soldiersbetween decks, and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel.Pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak, and sailed proudly pastunder the guns of the British frigates. Twenty leagues further on, hisaudacity having increased, he attacked with his pinnace, and captured alarge English transport which was carrying troops to Sicily, and which wasso loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the levelof the sea. In 1805 he was in that Malher division which took Günzbergfrom the Archduke Ferdinand. At Weltingen he received into his arms,beneath a storm of bullets, Colonel Maupetit, mortally wounded at the headof the 9th Dragoons. He distinguished himself at Austerlitz in thatadmirable march in echelons effected under the enemy&rsquo;s fire. When thecavalry of the Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th ofthe line, Pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrewthe Guard. The Emperor gave him the cross. Pontmercy saw Wurmser atMantua, Mélas, and Alexandria, Mack at Ulm, made prisoners in succession.He formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which Mortiercommanded, and which captured Hamburg. Then he was transferred to the 55thof the line, which was the old regiment of Flanders. At Eylau he was inthe cemetery where, for the space of two hours, the heroic Captain LouisHugo, the uncle of the author of this book, sustained alone with hiscompany of eighty-three men every effort of the hostile army. Pontmercywas one of the three who emerged alive from that cemetery. He was atFriedland. Then he saw Moscow. Then La Bérésina, then Lutzen, Bautzen,Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig, and the defiles of Gelenhausen; then Montmirail,Château-Thierry, Craon, the banks of the Marne, the banks of the Aisne,and the redoubtable position of Laon. At Arnay-Le-Duc, being then acaptain, he put ten Cossacks to the sword, and saved, not his general, buthis corporal. He was well slashed up on this occasion, and twenty-sevensplinters were extracted from his left arm alone. Eight days before thecapitulation of Paris he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered thecavalry. He had what was called under the old regime, <i>the double hand</i>,that is to say, an equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket asa soldier, or a squadron or a battalion as an officer. It is from thisaptitude, perfected by a military education, which certain specialbranches of the service arise, the dragoons, for example, who are bothcavalry-men and infantry at one and the same time. He accompanied Napoleonto the Island of Elba. At Waterloo, he was chief of a squadron ofcuirassiers, in Dubois&rsquo; brigade. It was he who captured the standard ofthe Lunenburg battalion. He came and cast the flag at the Emperor&rsquo;s feet.He was covered with blood. While tearing down the banner he had received asword-cut across his face. The Emperor, greatly pleased, shouted to him:&ldquo;You are a colonel, you are a baron, you are an officer of the Legion ofHonor!&rdquo; Pontmercy replied: &ldquo;Sire, I thank you for my widow.&rdquo; An hourlater, he fell in the ravine of Ohain. Now, who was this GeorgesPontmercy? He was this same &ldquo;brigand of the Loire.&rdquo;</p><p>We have already seen something of his history. After Waterloo, Pontmercy,who had been pulled out of the hollow road of Ohain, as it will beremembered, had succeeded in joining the army, and had dragged himselffrom ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the Loire.</p><p>The Restoration had placed him on half-pay, then had sent him intoresidence, that is to say, under surveillance, at Vernon. King LouisXVIII., regarding all that which had taken place during the Hundred Daysas not having occurred at all, did not recognize his quality as an officerof the Legion of Honor, nor his grade of colonel, nor his title of baron.He, on his side, neglected no occasion of signing himself &ldquo;Colonel BaronPontmercy.&rdquo; He had only an old blue coat, and he never went out withoutfastening to it his rosette as an officer of the Legion of Honor. TheAttorney for the Crown had him warned that the authorities would prosecutehim for &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; wearing of this decoration. When this notice wasconveyed to him through an officious intermediary, Pontmercy retorted witha bitter smile: &ldquo;I do not know whether I no longer understand French, orwhether you no longer speak it; but the fact is that I do not understand.&rdquo; Then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette. They darednot interfere with him. Two or three times the Minister of War and thegeneral in command of the department wrote to him with the followingaddress: <i>&ldquo;A Monsieur le Commandant Pontmercy.&rdquo; </i> He sent back theletters with the seals unbroken. At the same moment, Napoleon at SaintHelena was treating in the same fashion the missives of Sir Hudson Loweaddressed to <i>General Bonaparte</i>. Pontmercy had ended, may we bepardoned the expression, by having in his mouth the same saliva as hisEmperor.</p><p>In the same way, there were at Rome Carthaginian prisoners who refused tosalute Flaminius, and who had a little of Hannibal&rsquo;s spirit.</p><p>One day he encountered the district-attorney in one of the streets ofVernon, stepped up to him, and said: &ldquo;Mr. Crown Attorney, am I permittedto wear my scar?&rdquo;</p><p>He had nothing save his meagre half-pay as chief of squadron. He had hiredthe smallest house which he could find at Vernon. He lived there alone, wehave just seen how. Under the Empire, between two wars, he had found timeto marry Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The old bourgeois, thoroughlyindignant at bottom, had given his consent with a sigh, saying: &ldquo;Thegreatest families are forced into it.&rdquo; In 1815, Madame Pontmercy, anadmirable woman in every sense, by the way, lofty in sentiment and rare,and worthy of her husband, died, leaving a child. This child had been thecolonel&rsquo;s joy in his solitude; but the grandfather had imperativelyclaimed his grandson, declaring that if the child were not given to him hewould disinherit him. The father had yielded in the little one&rsquo;s interest,and had transferred his love to flowers.</p><p>Moreover, he had renounced everything, and neither stirred up mischief norconspired. He shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he wasthen doing and the great things which he had done. He passed his time inexpecting a pink or in recalling Austerlitz.</p><p>M. Gillenormand kept up no relations with his son-in-law. The colonel was&ldquo;a bandit&rdquo; to him. M. Gillenormand never mentioned the colonel, exceptwhen he occasionally made mocking allusions to &ldquo;his Baronship.&rdquo; It hadbeen expressly agreed that Pontmercy should never attempt to see his sonnor to speak to him, under penalty of having the latter handed over to himdisowned and disinherited. For the Gillenormands, Pontmercy was a manafflicted with the plague. They intended to bring up the child in theirown way. Perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions, but hesubmitted to them, thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no onebut himself.</p><p>The inheritance of Father Gillenormand did not amount to much; but theinheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was considerable. Thisaunt, who had remained unmarried, was very rich on the maternal side, andher sister&rsquo;s son was her natural heir. The boy, whose name was Marius,knew that he had a father, but nothing more. No one opened his mouth tohim about it. Nevertheless, in the society into which his grandfather tookhim, whispers, innuendoes, and winks, had eventually enlightened thelittle boy&rsquo;s mind; he had finally understood something of the case, and ashe naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were, so to speak, theair he breathed, by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration, hegradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain athis heart.</p><p>While he was growing up in this fashion, the colonel slipped away everytwo or three months, came to Paris on the sly, like a criminal breakinghis ban, and went and posted himself at Saint-Sulpice, at the hour whenAunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass. There, trembling lest the auntshould turn round, concealed behind a pillar, motionless, not daring tobreathe, he gazed at his child. The scarred veteran was afraid of that oldspinster.</p><p>From this had arisen his connection with the curé of Vernon, M. l&rsquo;AbbéMabeuf.</p><p>That worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice, who hadoften observed this man gazing at his child, and the scar on his cheek,and the large tears in his eyes. That man, who had so manly an air, yetwho was weeping like a woman, had struck the warden. That face had clungto his mind. One day, having gone to Vernon to see his brother, he hadencountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge, and had recognized the man ofSaint-Sulpice. The warden had mentioned the circumstance to the curé, andboth had paid the colonel a visit, on some pretext or other. This visitled to others. The colonel, who had been extremely reserved at first,ended by opening his heart, and the curé and the warden finally came toknow the whole history, and how Pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness tohis child&rsquo;s future. This caused the curé to regard him with veneration andtenderness, and the colonel, on his side, became fond of the curé. Andmoreover, when both are sincere and good, no men so penetrate each other,and so amalgamate with each other, as an old priest and an old soldier. Atbottom, the man is the same. The one has devoted his life to his countryhere below, the other to his country on high; that is the only difference.</p><p>Twice a year, on the first of January and on St. George&rsquo;s day, Mariuswrote duty letters to his father, which were dictated by his aunt, andwhich one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula; this wasall that M. Gillenormand tolerated; and the father answered them with verytender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0170" id="link2HCH0170"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;REQUIESCANT</h3><p>Madame de T.&rsquo;s salon was all that Marius Pontmercy knew of the world. Itwas the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life. Thisopening was sombre, and more cold than warmth, more night than day, cameto him through this skylight. This child, who had been all joy and lighton entering this strange world, soon became melancholy, and, what is stillmore contrary to his age, grave. Surrounded by all those singular andimposing personages, he gazed about him with serious amazement. Everythingconspired to increase this astonishment in him. There were in Madame deT.&rsquo;s salon some very noble ladies named Mathan, Noé, Lévis,&mdash;whichwas pronounced Lévi,&mdash;Cambis, pronounced Cambyse. These antiquevisages and these Biblical names mingled in the child&rsquo;s mind with the OldTestament which he was learning by heart, and when they were all there,seated in a circle around a dying fire, sparely lighted by a lamp shadedwith green, with their severe profiles, their gray or white hair, theirlong gowns of another age, whose lugubrious colors could not bedistinguished, dropping, at rare intervals, words which were both majesticand severe, little Marius stared at them with frightened eyes, in theconviction that he beheld not women, but patriarchs and magi, not realbeings, but phantoms.</p><p>With these phantoms, priests were sometimes mingled, frequenters of thisancient salon, and some gentlemen; the Marquis de Sass****, privatesecretary to Madame de Berry, the Vicomte de Val***, who published, underthe pseudonym of <i>Charles-Antoine</i>, monorhymed odes, the Prince deBeauff*******, who, though very young, had a gray head and a pretty andwitty wife, whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with goldtorsades alarmed these shadows, the Marquis de C***** d&rsquo;E******, the manin all France who best understood &ldquo;proportioned politeness,&rdquo; the Comted&rsquo;Am*****, the kindly man with the amiable chin, and the Chévalier dePort-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of the Louvre, called the King&rsquo;scabinet, M. de Port-de-Guy, bald, and rather aged than old, was wont torelate that in 1793, at the age of sixteen, he had been put in the galleysas refractory and chained with an octogenarian, the Bishop of Mirepoix,also refractory, but as a priest, while he was so in the capacity of asoldier. This was at Toulon. Their business was to go at night and gatherup on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had beenguillotined during the day; they bore away on their backs these drippingcorpses, and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at theback of the neck, which was dry in the morning and wet at night. Thesetragic tales abounded in Madame de T.&rsquo;s salon, and by dint of cursingMarat, they applauded Trestaillon. Some deputies of the undiscoverablevariety played their whist there; M. Thibord du Chalard, M. Lemarchant deGomicourt, and the celebrated scoffer of the right, M. Cornet-Dincourt.The bailiff de Ferrette, with his short breeches and his thin legs,sometimes traversed this salon on his way to M. de Talleyrand. He had beenM. le Comte d&rsquo;Artois&rsquo; companion in pleasures and unlike Aristotlecrouching under Campaspe, he had made the Guimard crawl on all fours, andin that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by abailiff. As for the priests, there was the Abbé Halma, the same to whom M.Larose, his collaborator on <i>la Foudre</i>, said: &ldquo;Bah! Who is there whois not fifty years old? a few greenhorns perhaps?&rdquo; The Abbé Letourneur,preacher to the King, the Abbé Frayssinous, who was not, as yet, eithercount, or bishop, or minister, or peer, and who wore an old cassock whosebuttons were missing, and the Abbé Keravenant, Curé ofSaint-Germain-des-Prés; also the Pope&rsquo;s Nuncio, then Monsignor Macchi,Archbishop of Nisibi, later on Cardinal, remarkable for his long, pensivenose, and another Monsignor, entitled thus: Abbate Palmieri, domesticprelate, one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the Holy See,Canon of the illustrious Liberian basilica, Advocate of the saints, <i>Postulatoredei Santi</i>, which refers to matters of canonization, and signifies verynearly: Master of Requests of the section of Paradise. Lastly, twocardinals, M. de la Luzerne, and M. de Cl****** T*******. The Cardinal ofLuzerne was a writer and was destined to have, a few years later, thehonor of signing in the <i>Conservateur</i> articles side by side withChateaubriand; M. de Cl****** T******* was Archbishop of Toul****, andoften made trips to Paris, to his nephew, the Marquis de T*******, who wasMinister of Marine and War. The Cardinal of Cl****** T******* was a merrylittle man, who displayed his red stockings beneath his tucked-up cassock;his specialty was a hatred of the Encyclopædia, and his desperate play atbilliards, and persons who, at that epoch, passed through the Rue M*****on summer evenings, where the hotel de Cl****** T******* then stood,halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of theCardinal shouting to his conclavist, Monseigneur Cotiret, Bishop <i>inpartibus</i> of Caryste: &ldquo;Mark, Abbé, I make a cannon.&rdquo; The Cardinal deCl****** T******* had been brought to Madame de T.&rsquo;s by his most intimatefriend, M. de Roquelaure, former Bishop of Senlis, and one of the Forty.M. de Roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at theAcademy; through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the librarywhere the French Academy then held its meetings, the curious could, onevery Tuesday, contemplate the Ex-Bishop of Senlis, usually standingerect, freshly powdered, in violet hose, with his back turned to the door,apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar.All these ecclesiastics, though for the most part as much courtiers aschurchmen, added to the gravity of the T. salon, whose seigniorial aspectwas accentuated by five peers of France, the Marquis de Vib****, theMarquis de Tal***, the Marquis de Herb*******, the Vicomte Damb***, andthe Duc de Val********. This Duc de Val********, although Prince deMon***, that is to say a reigning prince abroad, had so high an idea ofFrance and its peerage, that he viewed everything through their medium. Itwas he who said: &ldquo;The Cardinals are the peers of France of Rome; the lordsare the peers of France of England.&rdquo; Moreover, as it is indispensable thatthe Revolution should be everywhere in this century, this feudal salonwas, as we have said, dominated by a bourgeois. M. Gillenormand reignedthere.</p><p>There lay the essence and quintessence of the Parisian white society.There reputations, even Royalist reputations, were held in quarantine.There is always a trace of anarchy in renown. Chateaubriand, had heentered there, would have produced the effect of Père Duchêne. Some of thescoffed-at did, nevertheless, penetrate thither on sufferance. ComteBeug*** was received there, subject to correction.</p><p>The &ldquo;noble&rdquo; salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons. TheFaubourg Saint-Germain reeks of the fagot even now. The Royalists ofto-day are demagogues, let us record it to their credit.</p><p>At Madame de T.&rsquo;s the society was superior, taste was exquisite andhaughty, under the cover of a great show of politeness. Manners thereadmitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old régimeitself, buried but still alive. Some of these habits, especially in thematter of language, seem eccentric. Persons but superficially acquaintedwith them would have taken for provincial that which was only antique. Awoman was called <i>Madame la Générale. Madame la Colonelle</i> was notentirely disused. The charming Madame de Léon, in memory, no doubt, of theDuchesses de Longueville and de Chevreuse, preferred this appellation toher title of Princesse. The Marquise de Créquy was also called <i>Madamela Colonelle</i>.</p><p>It was this little high society which invented at the Tuileries therefinement of speaking to the King in private as <i>the King</i>, in thethird person, and never as <i>Your Majesty</i>, the designation of <i>YourMajesty</i> having been &ldquo;soiled by the usurper.&rdquo;</p><p>Men and deeds were brought to judgment there. They jeered at the age,which released them from the necessity of understanding it. They abettedeach other in amazement. They communicated to each other that modicum oflight which they possessed. Methuselah bestowed information on Epimenides.The deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the course of things. Theydeclared that the time which had elapsed since Coblentz had not existed.In the same manner that Louis XVIII. was by the grace of God, in the fiveand twentieth year of his reign, the emigrants were, by rights, in thefive and twentieth year of their adolescence.</p><p>All was harmonious; nothing was too much alive; speech hardly amounted toa breath; the newspapers, agreeing with the salons, seemed a papyrus.There were some young people, but they were rather dead. The liveries inthe antechamber were antiquated. These utterly obsolete personages wereserved by domestics of the same stamp.</p><p>They all had the air of having lived a long time ago, and of obstinatelyresisting the sepulchre. Nearly the whole dictionary consisted of <i>Conserver,Conservation, Conservateur; to be in good odor</i>,&mdash;that was thepoint. There are, in fact, aromatics in the opinions of these venerablegroups, and their ideas smelled of it. It was a mummified society. Themasters were embalmed, the servants were stuffed with straw.</p><p>A worthy old marquise, an <i>emigrée</i> and ruined, who had but asolitary maid, continued to say: &ldquo;My people.&rdquo;</p><p>What did they do in Madame de T.&rsquo;s salon? They were ultra.</p><p>To be ultra; this word, although what it represents may not havedisappeared, has no longer any meaning at the present day. Let us explainit.</p><p>To be ultra is to go beyond. It is to attack the sceptre in the name ofthe throne, and the mitre in the name of the altar; it is to ill-treat thething which one is dragging, it is to kick over the traces; it is to cavilat the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics;it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry; it is toinsult through excess of respect; it is to discover that the Pope is notsufficiently papish, that the King is not sufficiently royal, and that thenight has too much light; it is to be discontented with alabaster, withsnow, with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness; it is to be apartisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy; it is to be sostrongly for, as to be against.</p><p>The ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of theRestoration.</p><p>Nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in 1814and terminates about 1820, with the advent of M. de Villèle, the practicalman of the Right. These six years were an extraordinary moment; at one andthe same time brilliant and gloomy, smiling and sombre, illuminated as bythe radiance of dawn and entirely covered, at the same time, with theshadows of the great catastrophes which still filled the horizon and wereslowly sinking into the past. There existed in that light and that shadow,a complete little new and old world, comic and sad, juvenile and senile,which was rubbing its eyes; nothing resembles an awakening like a return;a group which regarded France with ill-temper, and which France regardedwith irony; good old owls of marquises by the streetful, who had returned,and of ghosts, the &ldquo;former&rdquo; subjects of amazement at everything, brave andnoble gentlemen who smiled at being in France but wept also, delighted tobehold their country once more, in despair at not finding their monarchy;the nobility of the Crusades treating the nobility of the Empire, that isto say, the nobility of the sword, with scorn; historic races who had lostthe sense of history; the sons of the companions of Charlemagne disdainingthe companions of Napoleon. The swords, as we have just remarked, returnedthe insult; the sword of Fontenoy was laughable and nothing but a scrap ofrusty iron; the sword of Marengo was odious and was only a sabre. Formerdays did not recognize Yesterday. People no longer had the feeling forwhat was grand. There was some one who called Bonaparte Scapin. ThisSociety no longer exists. Nothing of it, we repeat, exists to-day. When weselect from it some one figure at random, and attempt to make it liveagain in thought, it seems as strange to us as the world before theDeluge. It is because it, too, as a matter of fact, has been engulfed in adeluge. It has disappeared beneath two Revolutions. What billows areideas! How quickly they cover all that it is their mission to destroy andto bury, and how promptly they create frightful gulfs!</p><p>Such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid timeswhen M. Martainville had more wit than Voltaire.</p><p>These salons had a literature and politics of their own. They believed inFiévée. M. Agier laid down the law in them. They commentated M. Colnet,the old bookseller and publicist of the Quay Malaquais. Napoleon was tothem thoroughly the Corsican Ogre. Later on the introduction into historyof M. le Marquis de Bonaparte, Lieutenant-General of the King&rsquo;s armies,was a concession to the spirit of the age.</p><p>These salons did not long preserve their purity. Beginning with 1818,doctrinarians began to spring up in them, a disturbing shade. Their waywas to be Royalists and to excuse themselves for being so. Where theultras were very proud, the doctrinarians were rather ashamed. They hadwit; they had silence; their political dogma was suitably impregnated witharrogance; they should have succeeded. They indulged, and usefully too, inexcesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned coats. Themistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to create agedyouth. They assumed the poses of wise men. They dreamed of engrafting atemperate power on the absolute and excessive principle. They opposed, andsometimes with rare intelligence, conservative liberalism to theliberalism which demolishes. They were heard to say: &ldquo;Thanks for Royalism!It has rendered more than one service. It has brought back tradition,worship, religion, respect. It is faithful, brave, chivalric, loving,devoted. It has mingled, though with regret, the secular grandeurs of themonarchy with the new grandeurs of the nation. Its mistake is not tounderstand the Revolution, the Empire, glory, liberty, young ideas, younggenerations, the age. But this mistake which it makes with regard to us,&mdash;havewe not sometimes been guilty of it towards them? The Revolution, whoseheirs we are, ought to be intelligent on all points. To attack Royalism isa misconstruction of liberalism. What an error! And what blindness!Revolutionary France is wanting in respect towards historic France, thatis to say, towards its mother, that is to say, towards itself. After the5th of September, the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobilityof the Empire was treated after the 5th of July. They were unjust to theeagle, we are unjust to the fleur-de-lys. It seems that we must alwayshave something to proscribe! Does it serve any purpose to ungild the crownof Louis XIV., to scrape the coat of arms of Henry IV.? We scoff at M. deVaublanc for erasing the N&rsquo;s from the bridge of Jena! What was it that hedid? What are we doing? Bouvines belongs to us as well as Marengo. Thefleurs-de-lys are ours as well as the N&rsquo;s. That is our patrimony. To whatpurpose shall we diminish it? We must not deny our country in the past anymore than in the present. Why not accept the whole of history? Why notlove the whole of France?&rdquo;</p><p>It is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected Royalism, which wasdispleased at criticism and furious at protection.</p><p>The ultras marked the first epoch of Royalism, congregation characterizedthe second. Skill follows ardor. Let us confine ourselves here to thissketch.</p><p>In the course of this narrative, the author of this book has encounteredin his path this curious moment of contemporary history; he has beenforced to cast a passing glance upon it, and to trace once more some ofthe singular features of this society which is unknown to-day. But he doesit rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea. Souvenirs bothrespectful and affectionate, for they touch his mother, attach him to thispast. Moreover, let us remark, this same petty world had a grandeur of itsown. One may smile at it, but one can neither despise nor hate it. It wasthe France of former days.</p><p>Marius Pontmercy pursued some studies, as all children do. When he emergedfrom the hands of Aunt Gillenormand, his grandfather confided him to aworthy professor of the most purely classic innocence. This young soulwhich was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant.</p><p>Marius went through his years of college, then he entered the law school.He was a Royalist, fanatical and severe. He did not love his grandfathermuch, as the latter&rsquo;s gayety and cynicism repelled him, and his feelingstowards his father were gloomy.</p><p>He was, on the whole, a cold and ardent, noble, generous, proud,religious, enthusiastic lad; dignified to harshness, pure to shyness.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0171" id="link2HCH0171"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;END OF THE BRIGAND</h3><p>The conclusion of Marius&rsquo; classical studies coincided with M.Gillenormand&rsquo;s departure from society. The old man bade farewell to theFaubourg Saint-Germain and to Madame de T.&rsquo;s salon, and establishedhimself in the Marais, in his house of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.There he had for servants, in addition to the porter, that chambermaid,Nicolette, who had succeeded to Magnon, and that short-breathed and pursyBasque, who have been mentioned above.</p><p>In 1827, Marius had just attained his seventeenth year. One evening, onhis return home, he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Marius,&rdquo; said M. Gillenormand, &ldquo;you will set out for Vernon to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;To see your father.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius was seized with a trembling fit. He had thought of everythingexcept this&mdash;that he should one day be called upon to see his father.Nothing could be more unexpected, more surprising, and, let us admit it,more disagreeable to him. It was forcing estrangement into reconciliation.It was not an affliction, but it was an unpleasant duty.</p><p>Marius, in addition to his motives of political antipathy, was convincedthat his father, <i>the slasher</i>, as M. Gillenormand called him on hisamiable days, did not love him; this was evident, since he had abandonedhim to others. Feeling that he was not beloved, he did not love. &ldquo;Nothingis more simple,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p><p>He was so astounded that he did not question M. Gillenormand. Thegrandfather resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It appears that he is ill. He demands your presence.&rdquo;</p><p>And after a pause, he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Set out to-morrow morning. I think there is a coach which leaves the Courdes Fontaines at six o&rsquo;clock, and which arrives in the evening. Take it.He says that here is haste.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket.Marius might have set out that very evening and have been with his fatheron the following morning. A diligence from the Rue du Bouloi took the tripto Rouen by night at that date, and passed through Vernon. Neither Mariusnor M. Gillenormand thought of making inquiries about it.</p><p>The next day, at twilight, Marius reached Vernon. People were justbeginning to light their candles. He asked the first person whom he metfor &ldquo;M. Pontmercy&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; For in his own mind, he agreed with theRestoration, and like it, did not recognize his father&rsquo;s claim to thetitle of either colonel or baron.</p><p>The house was pointed out to him. He rang; a woman with a little lamp inher hand opened the door.</p><p>&ldquo;M. Pontmercy?&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>The woman remained motionless.</p><p>&ldquo;Is this his house?&rdquo; demanded Marius.</p><p>The woman nodded affirmatively.</p><p>&ldquo;Can I speak with him?&rdquo;</p><p>The woman shook her head.</p><p>&ldquo;But I am his son!&rdquo; persisted Marius. &ldquo;He is expecting me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He no longer expects you,&rdquo; said the woman.</p><p>Then he perceived that she was weeping.</p><p>She pointed to the door of a room on the ground floor; he entered.</p><p>In that room, which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on thechimney-piece, there were three men, one standing erect, another kneeling,and one lying at full length, on the floor in his shirt. The one on thefloor was the colonel.</p><p>The other two were the doctor, and the priest, who was engaged in prayer.</p><p>The colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously. As hehad a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness, he hadwritten to M. Gillenormand to demand his son. The malady had grown worse.On the very evening of Marius&rsquo; arrival at Vernon, the colonel had had anattack of delirium; he had risen from his bed, in spite of the servant&rsquo;sefforts to prevent him, crying: &ldquo;My son is not coming! I shall go to meethim!&rdquo; Then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the floor of theantechamber. He had just expired.</p><p>The doctor had been summoned, and the curé. The doctor had arrived toolate. The son had also arrived too late.</p><p>By the dim light of the candle, a large tear could be distinguished on thepale and prostrate colonel&rsquo;s cheek, where it had trickled from his deadeye. The eye was extinguished, but the tear was not yet dry. That tear washis son&rsquo;s delay.</p><p>Marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time, on thatvenerable and manly face, on those open eyes which saw not, on those whitelocks, those robust limbs, on which, here and there, brown lines, markingsword-thrusts, and a sort of red stars, which indicated bullet-holes, werevisible. He contemplated that gigantic sear which stamped heroism on thatcountenance upon which God had imprinted goodness. He reflected that thisman was his father, and that this man was dead, and a chill ran over him.</p><p>The sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in thepresence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched out indeath.</p><p>Anguish, poignant anguish, was in that chamber. The servant-woman waslamenting in a corner, the curé was praying, and his sobs were audible,the doctor was wiping his eyes; the corpse itself was weeping.</p><p>The doctor, the priest, and the woman gazed at Marius in the midst oftheir affliction without uttering a word; he was the stranger there.Marius, who was far too little affected, felt ashamed and embarrassed athis own attitude; he held his hat in his hand; and he dropped it on thefloor, in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him ofthe strength to hold it.</p><p>At the same time, he experienced remorse, and he despised himself forbehaving in this manner. But was it his fault? He did not love his father?Why should he!</p><p>The colonel had left nothing. The sale of big furniture barely paid theexpenses of his burial.</p><p>The servant found a scrap of paper, which she handed to Marius. Itcontained the following, in the colonel&rsquo;s handwriting:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>For my son</i>.&mdash;The Emperor made me a Baron on the battle-fieldof Waterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which Ipurchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That he will beworthy of it is a matter of course.&rdquo; Below, the colonel had added: &ldquo;Atthat same battle of Waterloo, a sergeant saved my life. The man&rsquo;s name wasThénardier. I think that he has recently been keeping a little inn, in avillage in the neighborhood of Paris, at Chelles or Montfermeil. If my sonmeets him, he will do all the good he can to Thénardier.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius took this paper and preserved it, not out of duty to his father,but because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious inthe heart of man.</p><p>Nothing remained of the colonel. M. Gillenormand had his sword and uniformsold to an old-clothes dealer. The neighbors devastated the garden andpillaged the rare flowers. The other plants turned to nettles and weeds,and died.</p><p>Marius remained only forty-eight hours at Vernon. After the interment hereturned to Paris, and applied himself again to his law studies, with nomore thought of his father than if the latter had never lived. In two daysthe colonel was buried, and in three forgotten.</p><p>Marius wore crape on his hat. That was all.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0172" id="link2HCH0172"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;THE UTILITY OF GOING TO MASS, IN ORDER TO BECOME AREVOLUTIONIST</h3><p>Marius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood. One Sunday,when he went to hear mass at Saint-Sulpice, at that same chapel of theVirgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad, he placed himselfbehind a pillar, being more absent-minded and thoughtful than usual onthat occasion, and knelt down, without paying any special heed, upon achair of Utrecht velvet, on the back of which was inscribed this name: <i>MonsieurMabeuf, warden</i>. Mass had hardly begun when an old man presentedhimself and said to Marius:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;This is my place, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius stepped aside promptly, and the old man took possession of hischair.</p><p>The mass concluded, Marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant;the old man approached him again and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, for having disturbed you a while ago, and foragain disturbing you at this moment; you must have thought me intrusive,and I will explain myself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is no need of that, Sir,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; went on the old man, &ldquo;I do not wish you to have a bad opinion ofme. You see, I am attached to this place. It seems to me that the mass isbetter from here. Why? I will tell you. It is from this place, that I havewatched a poor, brave father come regularly, every two or three months,for the last ten years, since he had no other opportunity and no other wayof seeing his child, because he was prevented by family arrangements. Hecame at the hour when he knew that his son would be brought to mass. Thelittle one never suspected that his father was there. Perhaps he did noteven know that he had a father, poor innocent! The father kept behind apillar, so that he might not be seen. He gazed at his child and he wept.He adored that little fellow, poor man! I could see that. This spot hasbecome sanctified in my sight, and I have contracted a habit of cominghither to listen to the mass. I prefer it to the stall to which I have aright, in my capacity of warden. I knew that unhappy gentleman a little,too. He had a father-in-law, a wealthy aunt, relatives, I don&rsquo;t knowexactly what all, who threatened to disinherit the child if he, thefather, saw him. He sacrificed himself in order that his son might be richand happy some day. He was separated from him because of politicalopinions. Certainly, I approve of political opinions, but there are peoplewho do not know where to stop. Mon Dieu! a man is not a monster because hewas at Waterloo; a father is not separated from his child for such areason as that. He was one of Bonaparte&rsquo;s colonels. He is dead, I believe.He lived at Vernon, where I have a brother who is a curé, and his name wassomething like Pontmarie or Montpercy. He had a fine sword-cut, on myhonor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pontmercy,&rdquo; suggested Marius, turning pale.</p><p>&ldquo;Precisely, Pontmercy. Did you know him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Marius, &ldquo;he was my father.&rdquo;</p><p>The old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! you are the child! Yes, that&rsquo;s true, he must be a man by this time.Well! poor child, you may say that you had a father who loved you dearly!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings.</p><p>On the following day, he said to M. Gillenormand:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have arranged a hunting-party with some friends. Will you permit me tobe absent for three days?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Four!&rdquo; replied his grandfather. &ldquo;Go and amuse yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>And he said to his daughter in a low tone, and with a wink, &ldquo;Some loveaffair!&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0173" id="link2HCH0173"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING MET A WARDEN</h3><p>Where it was that Marius went will be disclosed a little further on.</p><p>Marius was absent for three days, then he returned to Paris, went straightto the library of the law-school and asked for the files of the <i>Moniteur</i>.</p><p>He read the <i>Moniteur</i>, he read all the histories of the Republic andthe Empire, the <i>Memorial de Sainte-Hélène</i>, all the memoirs, all thenewspapers, the bulletins, the proclamations; he devoured everything. Thefirst time that he came across his father&rsquo;s name in the bulletins of thegrand army, he had a fever for a week. He went to see the generals underwhom Georges Pontmercy had served, among others, Comte H. Church-wardenMabeuf, whom he went to see again, told him about the life at Vernon, thecolonel&rsquo;s retreat, his flowers, his solitude. Marius came to a fullknowledge of that rare, sweet, and sublime man, that species of lion-lambwho had been his father.</p><p>In the meanwhile, occupied as he was with this study which absorbed allhis moments as well as his thoughts, he hardly saw the Gillenormands atall. He made his appearance at meals; then they searched for him, and hewas not to be found. Father Gillenormand smiled. &ldquo;Bah! bah! He is just ofthe age for the girls!&rdquo; Sometimes the old man added: &ldquo;The deuce! I thoughtit was only an affair of gallantry. It seems that it is an affair ofpassion!&rdquo;</p><p>It was a passion, in fact. Marius was on the high road to adoring hisfather.</p><p>At the same time, his ideas underwent an extraordinary change. The phasesof this change were numerous and successive. As this is the history ofmany minds of our day, we think it will prove useful to follow thesephases step by step and to indicate them all.</p><p>That history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him.</p><p>The first effect was to dazzle him.</p><p>Up to that time, the Republic, the Empire, had been to him only monstrouswords. The Republic, a guillotine in the twilight; the Empire, a sword inthe night. He had just taken a look at it, and where he had expected tofind only a chaos of shadows, he had beheld, with a sort of unprecedentedsurprise, mingled with fear and joy, stars sparkling, Mirabeau, Vergniaud,Saint-Just, Robespierre, Camille, Desmoulins, Danton, and a sun arise,Napoleon. He did not know where he stood. He recoiled, blinded by thebrilliant lights. Little by little, when his astonishment had passed off,he grew accustomed to this radiance, he contemplated these deeds withoutdizziness, he examined these personages without terror; the Revolution andthe Empire presented themselves luminously, in perspective, before hismind&rsquo;s eye; he beheld each of these groups of events and of men summed upin two tremendous facts: the Republic in the sovereignty of civil rightrestored to the masses, the Empire in the sovereignty of the French ideaimposed on Europe; he beheld the grand figure of the people emerge fromthe Revolution, and the grand figure of France spring forth from theEmpire. He asserted in his conscience, that all this had been good. Whathis dazzled state neglected in this, his first far too syntheticestimation, we do not think it necessary to point out here. It is thestate of a mind on the march that we are recording. Progress is notaccomplished in one stage. That stated, once for all, in connection withwhat precedes as well as with what is to follow, we continue.</p><p>He then perceived that, up to that moment, he had comprehended his countryno more than he had comprehended his father. He had not known either theone or the other, and a sort of voluntary night had obscured his eyes. Nowhe saw, and on the one hand he admired, while on the other he adored.</p><p>He was filled with regret and remorse, and he reflected in despair thatall he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb. Oh! if hisfather had still been in existence, if he had still had him, if God, inhis compassion and his goodness, had permitted his father to be stillamong the living, how he would have run, how he would have precipitatedhimself, how he would have cried to his father: &ldquo;Father! Here I am! It isI! I have the same heart as thou! I am thy son!&rdquo; How he would haveembraced that white head, bathed his hair in tears, gazed upon his scar,pressed his hands, adored his garment, kissed his feet! Oh! Why had hisfather died so early, before his time, before the justice, the love of hisson had come to him? Marius had a continual sob in his heart, which saidto him every moment: &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; At the same time, he became more trulyserious, more truly grave, more sure of his thought and his faith. At eachinstant, gleams of the true came to complete his reason. An inward growthseemed to be in progress within him. He was conscious of a sort of naturalenlargement, which gave him two things that were new to him&mdash;hisfather and his country.</p><p>As everything opens when one has a key, so he explained to himself thatwhich he had hated, he penetrated that which he had abhorred; henceforthhe plainly perceived the providential, divine and human sense of the greatthings which he had been taught to detest, and of the great men whom hehad been instructed to curse. When he reflected on his former opinions,which were but those of yesterday, and which, nevertheless, seemed to himalready so very ancient, he grew indignant, yet he smiled.</p><p>From the rehabilitation of his father, he naturally passed to therehabilitation of Napoleon.</p><p>But the latter, we will confess, was not effected without labor.</p><p>From his infancy, he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of1814, on Bonaparte. Now, all the prejudices of the Restoration, all itsinterests, all its instincts tended to disfigure Napoleon. It execratedhim even more than it did Robespierre. It had very cleverly turned tosufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation, and the hatred ofmothers. Bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster, and in order topaint him to the imagination of the people, which, as we lately pointedout, resembles the imagination of children, the party of 1814 made himappear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession, from that whichis terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is terrible andbecomes grotesque, from Tiberius to the bugaboo. Thus, in speaking ofBonaparte, one was free to sob or to puff up with laughter, provided thathatred lay at the bottom. Marius had never entertained&mdash;about <i>thatman</i>, as he was called&mdash;any other ideas in his mind. They hadcombined with the tenacity which existed in his nature. There was in him aheadstrong little man who hated Napoleon.</p><p>On reading history, on studying him, especially in the documents andmaterials for history, the veil which concealed Napoleon from the eyes ofMarius was gradually rent. He caught a glimpse of something immense, andhe suspected that he had been deceived up to that moment, on the score ofBonaparte as about all the rest; each day he saw more distinctly; and heset about mounting, slowly, step by step, almost regretfully in thebeginning, then with intoxication and as though attracted by anirresistible fascination, first the sombre steps, then the vaguelyilluminated steps, at last the luminous and splendid steps of enthusiasm.</p><p>One night, he was alone in his little chamber near the roof. His candlewas burning; he was reading, with his elbows resting on his table close tothe open window. All sorts of reveries reached him from space, and mingledwith his thoughts. What a spectacle is the night! One hears dull sounds,without knowing whence they proceed; one beholds Jupiter, which is twelvehundred times larger than the earth, glowing like a firebrand, the azureis black, the stars shine; it is formidable.</p><p>He was perusing the bulletins of the grand army, those heroic strophespenned on the field of battle; there, at intervals, he beheld his father&rsquo;sname, always the name of the Emperor; the whole of that great Empirepresented itself to him; he felt a flood swelling and rising within him;it seemed to him at moments that his father passed close to him like abreath, and whispered in his ear; he gradually got into a singular state;he thought that he heard drums, cannon, trumpets, the measured tread ofbattalions, the dull and distant gallop of the cavalry; from time to time,his eyes were raised heavenward, and gazed upon the colossalconstellations as they gleamed in the measureless depths of space, thenthey fell upon his book once more, and there they beheld other colossalthings moving confusedly. His heart contracted within him. He was in atransport, trembling, panting. All at once, without himself knowing whatwas in him, and what impulse he was obeying, he sprang to his feet,stretched both arms out of the window, gazed intently into the gloom, thesilence, the infinite darkness, the eternal immensity, and exclaimed:&ldquo;Long live the Emperor!&rdquo;</p><p>From that moment forth, all was over; the Ogre of Corsica,&mdash;theusurper,&mdash;the tyrant,&mdash;the monster who was the lover of his ownsisters,&mdash;the actor who took lessons of Talma,&mdash;the poisoner ofJaffa,&mdash;the tiger,&mdash;Buonaparte,&mdash;all this vanished, andgave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone,at an inaccessible height, the pale marble phantom of Cæsar. The Emperorhad been for his father only the well-beloved captain whom one admires,for whom one sacrifices one&rsquo;s self; he was something more to Marius. Hewas the predestined constructor of the French group, succeeding the Romangroup in the domination of the universe. He was a prodigious architect, ofa destruction, the continuer of Charlemagne, of Louis XI., of Henry IV.,of Richelieu, of Louis XIV., and of the Committee of Public Safety, havinghis spots, no doubt, his faults, his crimes even, being a man, that is tosay; but august in his faults, brilliant in his spots, powerful in hiscrime.</p><p>He was the predestined man, who had forced all nations to say: &ldquo;The greatnation!&rdquo; He was better than that, he was the very incarnation of France,conquering Europe by the sword which he grasped, and the world by thelight which he shed. Marius saw in Bonaparte the dazzling spectre whichwill always rise upon the frontier, and which will guard the future.Despot but dictator; a despot resulting from a republic and summing up arevolution. Napoleon became for him the man-people as Jesus Christ is theman-God.</p><p>It will be perceived, that like all new converts to a religion, hisconversion intoxicated him, he hurled himself headlong into adhesion andhe went too far. His nature was so constructed; once on the downwardslope, it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag. Fanaticism forthe sword took possession of him, and complicated in his mind hisenthusiasm for the idea. He did not perceive that, along with genius, andpell-mell, he was admitting force, that is to say, that he was installingin two compartments of his idolatry, on the one hand that which is divine,on the other that which is brutal. In many respects, he had set aboutdeceiving himself otherwise. He admitted everything. There is a way ofencountering error while on one&rsquo;s way to the truth. He had a violent sortof good faith which took everything in the lump. In the new path which hehad entered on, in judging the mistakes of the old regime, as in measuringthe glory of Napoleon, he neglected the attenuating circumstances.</p><p>At all events, a tremendous step had been taken. Where he had formerlybeheld the fall of the monarchy, he now saw the advent of France. Hisorientation had changed. What had been his East became the West. He hadturned squarely round.</p><p>All these revolutions were accomplished within him, without his familyobtaining an inkling of the case.</p><p>When, during this mysterious labor, he had entirely shed his old Bourbonand ultra skin, when he had cast off the aristocrat, the Jacobite and theRoyalist, when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist, profoundlydemocratic and republican, he went to an engraver on the Quai des Orfévresand ordered a hundred cards bearing this name: <i>Le Baron MariusPontmercy</i>.</p><p>This was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which hadtaken place in him, a change in which everything gravitated round hisfather.</p><p>Only, as he did not know any one and could not sow his cards with anyporter, he put them in his pocket.</p><p>By another natural consequence, in proportion as he drew nearer to hisfather, to the latter&rsquo;s memory, and to the things for which the colonelhad fought five and twenty years before, he receded from his grandfather.We have long ago said, that M. Gillenormand&rsquo;s temper did not please him.There already existed between them all the dissonances of the grave youngman and the frivolous old man. The gayety of Géronte shocks andexasperates the melancholy of Werther. So long as the same politicalopinions and the same ideas had been common to them both, Marius had metM. Gillenormand there as on a bridge. When the bridge fell, an abyss wasformed. And then, over and above all, Marius experienced unutterableimpulses to revolt, when he reflected that it was M. Gillenormand who had,from stupid motives, torn him ruthlessly from the colonel, thus deprivingthe father of the child, and the child of the father.</p><p>By dint of pity for his father, Marius had nearly arrived at aversion forhis grandfather.</p><p>Nothing of this sort, however, was betrayed on the exterior, as we havealready said. Only he grew colder and colder; laconic at meals, and rarein the house. When his aunt scolded him for it, he was very gentle andalleged his studies, his lectures, the examinations, etc., as a pretext.His grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis: &ldquo;In love! Iknow all about it.&rdquo;</p><p>From time to time Marius absented himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is it that he goes off like this?&rdquo; said his aunt.</p><p>On one of these trips, which were always very brief, he went toMontfermeil, in order to obey the injunction which his father had lefthim, and he sought the old sergeant to Waterloo, the inn-keeperThénardier. Thénardier had failed, the inn was closed, and no one knewwhat had become of him. Marius was away from the house for four days onthis quest.</p><p>&ldquo;He is getting decidedly wild,&rdquo; said his grandfather.</p><p>They thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast, underhis shirt, which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0174" id="link2HCH0174"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;SOME PETTICOAT</h3><p>We have mentioned a lancer.</p><p>He was a great-grand-nephew of M. Gillenormand, on the paternal side, wholed a garrison life, outside the family and far from the domestic hearth.Lieutenant Théodule Gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions required tomake what is called a fine officer. He had &ldquo;a lady&rsquo;s waist,&rdquo; a victoriousmanner of trailing his sword and of twirling his moustache in a hook. Hevisited Paris very rarely, and so rarely that Marius had never seen him.The cousins knew each other only by name. We think we have said thatThéodule was the favorite of Aunt Gillenormand, who preferred him becauseshe did not see him. Not seeing people permits one to attribute to themall possible perfections.</p><p>One morning, Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder returned to her apartmentas much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing. Marius hadjust asked his grandfather&rsquo;s permission to take a little trip, adding thathe meant to set out that very evening. &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; had been his grandfather&rsquo;sreply, and M. Gillenormand had added in an aside, as he raised hiseyebrows to the top of his forehead: &ldquo;Here he is passing the night outagain.&rdquo; Mademoiselle Gillenormand had ascended to her chamber greatlypuzzled, and on the staircase had dropped this exclamation: &ldquo;This is toomuch!&rdquo;&mdash;and this interrogation: &ldquo;But where is it that he goes?&rdquo; Sheespied some adventure of the heart, more or less illicit, a woman in theshadow, a rendezvous, a mystery, and she would not have been sorry tothrust her spectacles into the affair. Tasting a mystery resembles gettingthe first flavor of a scandal; sainted souls do not detest this. There issome curiosity about scandal in the secret compartments of bigotry.</p><p>So she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history.</p><p>In order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyondher wont, she took refuge in her talents, and set about scalloping, withone layer of cotton after another, one of those embroideries of the Empireand the Restoration, in which there are numerous cart-wheels. The work wasclumsy, the worker cross. She had been seated at this for several hourswhen the door opened. Mademoiselle Gillenormand raised her nose.Lieutenant Théodule stood before her, making the regulation salute. Sheuttered a cry of delight. One may be old, one may be a prude, one may bepious, one may be an aunt, but it is always agreeable to see a lancerenter one&rsquo;s chamber.</p><p>&ldquo;You here, Théodule!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p><p>&ldquo;On my way through town, aunt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Embrace me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo; said Théodule.</p><p>And he kissed her. Aunt Gillenormand went to her writing-desk and openedit.</p><p>&ldquo;You will remain with us a week at least?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I leave this very evening, aunt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is not possible!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mathematically!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Remain, my little Théodule, I beseech you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My heart says &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; but my orders say &lsquo;no.&rsquo; The matter is simple. Theyare changing our garrison; we have been at Melun, we are being transferredto Gaillon. It is necessary to pass through Paris in order to get from theold post to the new one. I said: &lsquo;I am going to see my aunt.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here is something for your trouble.&rdquo;</p><p>And she put ten louis into his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;For my pleasure, you mean to say, my dear aunt.&rdquo;</p><p>Théodule kissed her again, and she experienced the joy of having some ofthe skin scratched from her neck by the braidings on his uniform.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you making the journey on horseback, with your regiment?&rdquo; she askedhim.</p><p>&ldquo;No, aunt. I wanted to see you. I have special permission. My servant istaking my horse; I am travelling by diligence. And, by the way, I want toask you something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is my cousin Marius Pontmercy travelling so, too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo; said his aunt, suddenly pricked to the quick witha lively curiosity.</p><p>&ldquo;On my arrival, I went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coupé.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial. I saw hisname on the card.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Marius Pontmercy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The wicked fellow!&rdquo; exclaimed his aunt. &ldquo;Ah! your cousin is not a steadylad like yourself. To think that he is to pass the night in a diligence!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just as I am going to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;it is your duty; in his case, it is wildness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; said Théodule.</p><p>Here an event occurred to Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder,&mdash;anidea struck her. If she had been a man, she would have slapped her brow.She apostrophized Théodule:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you aware whether your cousin knows you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I have seen him; but he has never deigned to notice me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you are going to travel together?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He in the imperial, I in the coupé.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where does this diligence run?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To Andelys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then that is where Marius is going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Unless, like myself, he should stop on the way. I get down at Vernon, inorder to take the branch coach for Gaillon. I know nothing of Marius&rsquo; planof travel.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Marius! what an ugly name! what possessed them to name him Marius? Whileyou, at least, are called Théodule.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I would rather be called Alfred,&rdquo; said the officer.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, Théodule.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am listening, aunt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pay attention.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am paying attention.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You understand?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Marius absents himself!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eh! eh!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He travels.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He spends the night out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We should like to know what there is behind all this.&rdquo;</p><p>Théodule replied with the composure of a man of bronze:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Some petticoat or other.&rdquo;</p><p>And with that inward laugh which denotes certainty, he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;A lass.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is evident,&rdquo; exclaimed his aunt, who thought she heard M.Gillenormand speaking, and who felt her conviction become irresistible atthat word <i>fillette</i>, accentuated in almost the very same fashion bythe granduncle and the grandnephew. She resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do us a favor. Follow Marius a little. He does not know you, it will beeasy. Since a lass there is, try to get a sight of her. You must write usthe tale. It will amuse his grandfather.&rdquo;</p><p>Théodule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying; but he was muchtouched by the ten louis, and he thought he saw a chance for a possiblesequel. He accepted the commission and said: &ldquo;As you please, aunt.&rdquo;</p><p>And he added in an aside, to himself: &ldquo;Here I am a duenna.&rdquo;</p><p>Mademoiselle Gillenormand embraced him.</p><p>&ldquo;You are not the man to play such pranks, Théodule. You obey discipline,you are the slave of orders, you are a man of scruples and duty, and youwould not quit your family to go and see a creature.&rdquo;</p><p>The lancer made the pleased grimace of Cartouche when praised for hisprobity.</p><p>Marius, on the evening following this dialogue, mounted the diligencewithout suspecting that he was watched. As for the watcher, the firstthing he did was to fall asleep. His slumber was complete andconscientious. Argus snored all night long.</p><p>At daybreak, the conductor of the diligence shouted: &ldquo;Vernon! relay ofVernon! Travellers for Vernon!&rdquo; And Lieutenant Théodule woke.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he growled, still half asleep, &ldquo;this is where I get out.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, as his memory cleared by degrees, the effect of waking, he recalledhis aunt, the ten louis, and the account which he had undertaken to renderof the deeds and proceedings of Marius. This set him to laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is no longer in the coach,&rdquo; he thought, as he rebuttoned thewaistcoat of his undress uniform. &ldquo;He may have stopped at Poissy; he mayhave stopped at Triel; if he did not get out at Meulan, he may have gotout at Mantes, unless he got out at Rolleboise, or if he did not go on asfar as Pacy, with the choice of turning to the left at Évreus, or to theright at Laroche-Guyon. Run after him, aunty. What the devil am I to writeto that good old soul?&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial, madeits appearance at the window of the coupé.</p><p>&ldquo;Can that be Marius?&rdquo; said the lieutenant.</p><p>It was Marius.</p><p>A little peasant girl, all entangled with the horses and the postilions atthe end of the vehicle, was offering flowers to the travellers. &ldquo;Give yourladies flowers!&rdquo; she cried.</p><p>Marius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat basket.</p><p>&ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; said Théodule, leaping down from the coupé, &ldquo;this piques mycuriosity. Who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to? She mustbe a splendidly handsome woman for so fine a bouquet. I want to see her.&rdquo;</p><p>And no longer in pursuance of orders, but from personal curiosity, likedogs who hunt on their own account, he set out to follow Marius.</p><p>Marius paid no attention to Théodule. Elegant women descended from thediligence; he did not glance at them. He seemed to see nothing around him.</p><p>&ldquo;He is pretty deeply in love!&rdquo; thought Théodule.</p><p>Marius directed his steps towards the church.</p><p>&ldquo;Capital,&rdquo; said Théodule to himself. &ldquo;Rendezvous seasoned with a bit ofmass are the best sort. Nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passesover the good God&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p><p>On arriving at the church, Marius did not enter it, but skirted the apse.He disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse.</p><p>&ldquo;The rendezvous is appointed outside,&rdquo; said Théodule. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a lookat the lass.&rdquo;</p><p>And he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which Mariushad turned.</p><p>On arriving there, he halted in amazement.</p><p>Marius, with his forehead clasped in his hands, was kneeling upon thegrass on a grave. He had strewn his bouquet there. At the extremity of thegrave, on a little swelling which marked the head, there stood a cross ofblack wood with this name in white letters: COLONEL BARON PONTMERCY.Marius&rsquo; sobs were audible.</p><p>The &ldquo;lass&rdquo; was a grave.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0175" id="link2HCH0175"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;MARBLE AGAINST GRANITE</h3><p>It was hither that Marius had come on the first occasion of his absentinghimself from Paris. It was hither that he had come every time that M.Gillenormand had said: &ldquo;He is sleeping out.&rdquo;</p><p>Lieutenant Théodule was absolutely put out of countenance by thisunexpected encounter with a sepulchre; he experienced a singular anddisagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing, and which wascomposed of respect for the tomb, mingled with respect for the colonel. Heretreated, leaving Marius alone in the cemetery, and there was disciplinein this retreat. Death appeared to him with large epaulets, and he almostmade the military salute to him. Not knowing what to write to his aunt, hedecided not to write at all; and it is probable that nothing would haveresulted from the discovery made by Théodule as to the love affairs ofMarius, if, by one of those mysterious arrangements which are so frequentin chance, the scene at Vernon had not had an almost immediatecounter-shock at Paris.</p><p>Marius returned from Vernon on the third day, in the middle of themorning, descended at his grandfather&rsquo;s door, and, wearied by the twonights spent in the diligence, and feeling the need of repairing his lossof sleep by an hour at the swimming-school, he mounted rapidly to hischamber, took merely time enough to throw off his travelling-coat, and theblack ribbon which he wore round his neck, and went off to the bath.</p><p>M. Gillenormand, who had risen betimes like all old men in good health,had heard his entrance, and had made haste to climb, as quickly as his oldlegs permitted, the stairs to the upper story where Marius lived, in orderto embrace him, and to question him while so doing, and to find out wherehe had been.</p><p>But the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had toascend, and when Father Gillenormand entered the attic, Marius was nolonger there.</p><p>The bed had not been disturbed, and on the bed lay, outspread, but notdefiantly the great-coat and the black ribbon.</p><p>&ldquo;I like this better,&rdquo; said M. Gillenormand.</p><p>And a moment later, he made his entrance into the salon, whereMademoiselle Gillenormand was already seated, busily embroidering hercart-wheels.</p><p>The entrance was a triumphant one.</p><p>M. Gillenormand held in one hand the great-coat, and in the other theneck-ribbon, and exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Victory! We are about to penetrate the mystery! We are going to learn themost minute details; we are going to lay our finger on the debaucheries ofour sly friend! Here we have the romance itself. I have the portrait!&rdquo;</p><p>In fact, a case of black shagreen, resembling a medallion portrait, wassuspended from the ribbon.</p><p>The old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without openingit, with that air of enjoyment, rapture, and wrath, with which a poorhungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which is not for him, pass underhis very nose.</p><p>&ldquo;For this evidently is a portrait. I know all about such things. That isworn tenderly on the heart. How stupid they are! Some abominable frightthat will make us shudder, probably! Young men have such bad tastenowadays!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us see, father,&rdquo; said the old spinster.</p><p>The case opened by the pressure of a spring. They found in it nothing buta carefully folded paper.</p><p><i>&ldquo;From the same to the same,&rdquo;</i> said M. Gillenormand, bursting withlaughter. &ldquo;I know what it is. A billet-doux.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! let us read it!&rdquo; said the aunt.</p><p>And she put on her spectacles. They unfolded the paper and read asfollows:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;<i>For my son</i>.&mdash;The Emperor made me a Baron on the battlefieldof Waterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which Ipurchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That he will beworthy of it is a matter of course.&rdquo;</p><p>The feelings of father and daughter cannot be described. They felt chilledas by the breath of a death&rsquo;s-head. They did not exchange a word.</p><p>Only, M. Gillenormand said in a low voice and as though speaking tohimself:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It is the slasher&rsquo;s handwriting.&rdquo;</p><p>The aunt examined the paper, turned it about in all directions, then putit back in its case.</p><p>At the same moment a little oblong packet, enveloped in blue paper, fellfrom one of the pockets of the great-coat. Mademoiselle Gillenormandpicked it up and unfolded the blue paper.</p><p>It contained Marius&rsquo; hundred cards. She handed one of them to M.Gillenormand, who read: <i>Le Baron Marius Pontmercy</i>.</p><p>The old man rang the bell. Nicolette came. M. Gillenormand took theribbon, the case, and the coat, flung them all on the floor in the middleof the room, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Carry those duds away.&rdquo;</p><p>A full hour passed in the most profound silence. The old man and the oldspinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other, and werethinking, each on his own account, the same things, in all probability.</p><p>At the expiration of this hour, Aunt Gillenormand said:&mdash;&ldquo;A prettystate of things!&rdquo;</p><p>A few moments later, Marius made his appearance. He entered. Even beforehe had crossed the threshold, he saw his grandfather holding one of hisown cards in his hand, and on catching sight of him, the latter exclaimedwith his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was somethingcrushing:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Well! well! well! well! well! so you are a baron now. I present you mycompliments. What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius reddened slightly and replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It means that I am the son of my father.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Gillenormand ceased to laugh, and said harshly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am your father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; retorted Marius, with downcast eyes and a severe air, &ldquo;was ahumble and heroic man, who served the Republic and France gloriously, whowas great in the greatest history that men have ever made, who lived inthe bivouac for a quarter of a century, beneath grape-shot and bullets, insnow and mud by day, beneath rain at night, who captured two flags, whoreceived twenty wounds, who died forgotten and abandoned, and who nevercommitted but one mistake, which was to love too fondly two ingrates, hiscountry and myself.&rdquo;</p><p>This was more than M. Gillenormand could bear to hear. At the word <i>republic</i>,he rose, or, to speak more correctly, he sprang to his feet. Every wordthat Marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the old Royalistthe effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing brand. From adull hue he had turned red, from red, purple, and from purple,flame-colored.</p><p>&ldquo;Marius!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Abominable child! I do not know what your father was!I do not wish to know! I know nothing about that, and I do not know him!But what I do know is, that there never was anything but scoundrels amongthose men! They were all rascals, assassins, red-caps, thieves! I say all!I say all! I know not one! I say all! Do you hear me, Marius! See here,you are no more a baron than my slipper is! They were all bandits in theservice of Robespierre! All who served B-u-o-naparté were brigands! Theywere all traitors who betrayed, betrayed, betrayed their legitimate king!All cowards who fled before the Prussians and the English at Waterloo!That is what I do know! Whether Monsieur your father comes in thatcategory, I do not know! I am sorry for it, so much the worse, your humbleservant!&rdquo;</p><p>In his turn, it was Marius who was the firebrand and M. Gillenormand whowas the bellows. Marius quivered in every limb, he did not know what wouldhappen next, his brain was on fire. He was the priest who beholds all hissacred wafers cast to the winds, the fakir who beholds a passer-by spitupon his idol. It could not be that such things had been uttered in hispresence. What was he to do? His father had just been trampled under footand stamped upon in his presence, but by whom? By his grandfather. How washe to avenge the one without outraging the other? It was impossible forhim to insult his grandfather and it was equally impossible for him toleave his father unavenged. On the one hand was a sacred grave, on theother hoary locks.</p><p>He stood there for several moments, staggering as though intoxicated, withall this whirlwind dashing through his head; then he raised his eyes,gazed fixedly at his grandfather, and cried in a voice of thunder:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Down with the Bourbons, and that great hog of a Louis XVIII.!&rdquo;</p><p>Louis XVIII. had been dead for four years; but it was all the same to him.</p><p>The old man, who had been crimson, turned whiter than his hair. He wheeledround towards a bust of M. le Duc de Berry, which stood on thechimney-piece, and made a profound bow, with a sort of peculiar majesty.Then he paced twice, slowly and in silence, from the fireplace to thewindow and from the window to the fireplace, traversing the whole lengthof the room, and making the polished floor creak as though he had been astone statue walking.</p><p>On his second turn, he bent over his daughter, who was watching thisencounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb, and said to herwith a smile that was almost calm: &ldquo;A baron like this gentleman, and abourgeois like myself cannot remain under the same roof.&rdquo;</p><p>And drawing himself up, all at once, pallid, trembling, terrible, with hisbrow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath, he extendedhis arm towards Marius and shouted to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Be off!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius left the house.</p><p>On the following day, M. Gillenormand said to his daughter:</p><p>&ldquo;You will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood-drinker, andyou will never mention his name to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of, and not knowingwhat to do with it, he continued to address his daughter as <i>you</i>instead of <i>thou</i> for the next three months.</p><p>Marius, on his side, had gone forth in indignation. There was onecircumstance which, it must be admitted, aggravated his exasperation.There are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domesticdramas. They augment the grievances in such cases, although, in reality,the wrongs are not increased by them. While carrying Marius&rsquo; &ldquo;duds&rdquo; precipitately to his chamber, at his grandfather&rsquo;s command, Nicolette had,inadvertently, let fall, probably, on the attic staircase, which was dark,that medallion of black shagreen which contained the paper penned by thecolonel. Neither paper nor case could afterwards be found. Marius wasconvinced that &ldquo;Monsieur Gillenormand&rdquo;&mdash;from that day forth he neveralluded to him otherwise&mdash;had flung &ldquo;his father&rsquo;s testament&rdquo; in thefire. He knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written, and,consequently, nothing was lost. But the paper, the writing, that sacredrelic,&mdash;all that was his very heart. What had been done with it?</p><p>Marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going, andwithout knowing where, with thirty francs, his watch, and a few clothes ina hand-bag. He had entered a hackney-coach, had engaged it by the hour,and had directed his course at hap-hazard towards the Latin quarter.</p><p>What was to become of Marius?</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0201" id="link2H_4_0201"></a>BOOK FOURTH&mdash;THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0176" id="link2HCH0176"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;A GROUP WHICH BARELY MISSED BECOMING HISTORIC</h3><p>At that epoch, which was, to all appearances indifferent, a certainrevolutionary quiver was vaguely current. Breaths which had started forthfrom the depths of &rsquo;89 and &rsquo;93 were in the air. Youth was on the point,may the reader pardon us the word, of moulting. People were undergoing atransformation, almost without being conscious of it, through the movementof the age. The needle which moves round the compass also moves in souls.Each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound to take.The Royalists were becoming liberals, liberals were turning democrats. Itwas a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb movements; thepeculiarity of ebbs is to create intermixtures; hence the combination ofvery singular ideas; people adored both Napoleon and liberty. We aremaking history here. These were the mirages of that period. Opinionstraverse phases. Voltairian royalism, a quaint variety, had a no lesssingular sequel, Bonapartist liberalism.</p><p>Other groups of minds were more serious. In that direction, they soundedprinciples, they attached themselves to the right. They grew enthusiasticfor the absolute, they caught glimpses of infinite realizations; theabsolute, by its very rigidity, urges spirits towards the sky and causesthem to float in illimitable space. There is nothing like dogma forbringing forth dreams. And there is nothing like dreams for engenderingthe future. Utopia to-day, flesh and blood to-morrow.</p><p>These advanced opinions had a double foundation. A beginning of mysterymenaced &ldquo;the established order of things,&rdquo; which was suspicious andunderhand. A sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree. Thesecond thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in themine. The incubation of insurrections gives the retort to thepremeditation of <i>coups d&rsquo;état</i>.</p><p>There did not, as yet, exist in France any of those vast underlyingorganizations, like the German <i>tugendbund</i> and Italian Carbonarism;but here and there there were dark underminings, which were in process ofthrowing off shoots. The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix; thereexisted at Paris, among other affiliations of that nature, the society ofthe Friends of the A B C.</p><p>What were these Friends of the A B C? A society which had for its objectapparently the education of children, in reality the elevation of man.</p><p>They declared themselves the Friends of the A B C,&mdash;the <i>Abaissé</i>,&mdash;thedebased,&mdash;that is to say, the people. They wished to elevate thepeople. It was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at. Puns aresometimes serious factors in politics; witness the <i>Castratus ad castra</i>,which made a general of the army of Narses; witness: <i>Barbari etBarberini</i>; witness: <i>Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram</i>, etc.,etc.</p><p>The Friends of the A B C were not numerous, it was a secret society in thestate of embryo, we might almost say a coterie, if coteries ended inheroes. They assembled in Paris in two localities, near the fish-market,in a wine-shop called <i>Corinthe</i>, of which more will be heard lateron, and near the Pantheon in a little café in the Rue Saint-Michel calledthe <i>Café Musain</i>, now torn down; the first of these meeting-placeswas close to the workingman, the second to the students.</p><p>The assemblies of the Friends of the A B C were usually held in a backroom of the Café Musain.</p><p>This hall, which was tolerably remote from the café, with which it wasconnected by an extremely long corridor, had two windows and an exit witha private stairway on the little Rue des Grès. There they smoked anddrank, and gambled and laughed. There they conversed in very loud tonesabout everything, and in whispers of other things. An old map of Franceunder the Republic was nailed to the wall,&mdash;a sign quite sufficientto excite the suspicion of a police agent.</p><p>The greater part of the Friends of the A B C were students, who were oncordial terms with the working classes. Here are the names of theprincipal ones. They belong, in a certain measure, to history: Enjolras,Combeferre, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly, Courfeyrac, Bahorel, Lesgle orLaigle, Joly, Grantaire.</p><p>These young men formed a sort of family, through the bond of friendship.All, with the exception of Laigle, were from the South.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0024" id="linkimage-0024"></a><img src="images/3b4-1-abc-friends.jpg" alt="Friends of the a B C" width="100%" /></div><p>This was a remarkable group. It vanished in the invisible depths which liebehind us. At the point of this drama which we have now reached, it willnot perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon these youthfulheads, before the reader beholds them plunging into the shadow of a tragicadventure.</p><p>Enjolras, whose name we have mentioned first of all,&mdash;the readershall see why later on,&mdash;was an only son and wealthy.</p><p>Enjolras was a charming young man, who was capable of being terrible. Hewas angelically handsome. He was a savage Antinous. One would have said,to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance, that he had already, insome previous state of existence, traversed the revolutionary apocalypse.He possessed the tradition of it as though he had been a witness. He wasacquainted with all the minute details of the great affair. A pontificaland warlike nature, a singular thing in a youth. He was an officiatingpriest and a man of war; from the immediate point of view, a soldier ofthe democracy; above the contemporary movement, the priest of the ideal.His eyes were deep, his lids a little red, his lower lip was thick andeasily became disdainful, his brow was lofty. A great deal of brow in aface is like a great deal of horizon in a view. Like certain young men atthe beginning of this century and the end of the last, who becameillustrious at an early age, he was endowed with excessive youth, and wasas rosy as a young girl, although subject to hours of pallor. Already aman, he still seemed a child. His two and twenty years appeared to be butseventeen; he was serious, it did not seem as though he were aware therewas on earth a thing called woman. He had but one passion&mdash;the right;but one thought&mdash;to overthrow the obstacle. On Mount Aventine, hewould have been Gracchus; in the Convention, he would have beenSaint-Just. He hardly saw the roses, he ignored spring, he did not hearthe carolling of the birds; the bare throat of Evadne would have moved himno more than it would have moved Aristogeiton; he, like Harmodius, thoughtflowers good for nothing except to conceal the sword. He was severe in hisenjoyments. He chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was notthe Republic. He was the marble lover of liberty. His speech was harshlyinspired, and had the thrill of a hymn. He was subject to unexpectedoutbursts of soul. Woe to the love-affair which should have risked itselfbeside him! If any grisette of the Place Cambrai or the RueSaint-Jean-de-Beauvais, seeing that face of a youth escaped from college,that page&rsquo;s mien, those long, golden lashes, those blue eyes, that hairbillowing in the wind, those rosy cheeks, those fresh lips, thoseexquisite teeth, had conceived an appetite for that complete aurora, andhad tried her beauty on Enjolras, an astounding and terrible glance wouldhave promptly shown her the abyss, and would have taught her not toconfound the mighty cherub of Ezekiel with the gallant Cherubino ofBeaumarchais.</p><p>By the side of Enjolras, who represented the logic of the Revolution,Combeferre represented its philosophy. Between the logic of the Revolutionand its philosophy there exists this difference&mdash;that its logic mayend in war, whereas its philosophy can end only in peace. Combeferrecomplemented and rectified Enjolras. He was less lofty, but broader. Hedesired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of general ideas:he said: &ldquo;Revolution, but civilization&rdquo;; and around the mountain peak heopened out a vast view of the blue sky. The Revolution was more adaptedfor breathing with Combeferre than with Enjolras. Enjolras expressed itsdivine right, and Combeferre its natural right. The first attached himselfto Robespierre; the second confined himself to Condorcet. Combeferre livedthe life of all the rest of the world more than did Enjolras. If it hadbeen granted to these two young men to attain to history, the one wouldhave been the just, the other the wise man. Enjolras was the more virile,Combeferre the more humane. <i>Homo</i> and <i>vir</i>, that was the exacteffect of their different shades. Combeferre was as gentle as Enjolras wassevere, through natural whiteness. He loved the word <i>citizen</i>, buthe preferred the word <i>man</i>. He would gladly have said: <i>Hombre</i>,like the Spanish. He read everything, went to the theatres, attended thecourses of public lecturers, learned the polarization of light from Arago,grew enthusiastic over a lesson in which Geoffroy Sainte-Hilaire explainedthe double function of the external carotid artery, and the internal, theone which makes the face, and the one which makes the brain; he kept upwith what was going on, followed science step by step, comparedSaint-Simon with Fourier, deciphered hieroglyphics, broke the pebble whichhe found and reasoned on geology, drew from memory a silkworm moth,pointed out the faulty French in the Dictionary of the Academy, studiedPuységur and Deleuze, affirmed nothing, not even miracles; denied nothing,not even ghosts; turned over the files of the <i>Moniteur</i>, reflected.He declared that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster, andbusied himself with educational questions. He desired that society shouldlabor without relaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectuallevel, at coining science, at putting ideas into circulation, atincreasing the mind in youthful persons, and he feared lest the presentpoverty of method, the paltriness from a literary point of view confinedto two or three centuries called classic, the tyrannical dogmatism ofofficial pedants, scholastic prejudices and routines should end byconverting our colleges into artificial oyster beds. He was learned, apurist, exact, a graduate of the Polytechnic, a close student, and at thesame time, thoughtful &ldquo;even to chimæras,&rdquo; so his friends said. He believedin all dreams, railroads, the suppression of suffering in chirurgicaloperations, the fixing of images in the dark chamber, the electrictelegraph, the steering of balloons. Moreover, he was not much alarmed bythe citadels erected against the human mind in every direction, bysuperstition, despotism, and prejudice. He was one of those who think thatscience will eventually turn the position. Enjolras was a chief,Combeferre was a guide. One would have liked to fight under the one and tomarch behind the other. It is not that Combeferre was not capable offighting, he did not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle, andto attack it by main force and explosively; but it suited him better tobring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually, by means ofeducation, the inculcation of axioms, the promulgation of positive laws;and, between two lights, his preference was rather for illumination thanfor conflagration. A conflagration can create an aurora, no doubt, but whynot await the dawn? A volcano illuminates, but daybreak furnishes a stillbetter illumination. Possibly, Combeferre preferred the whiteness of thebeautiful to the blaze of the sublime. A light troubled by smoke, progresspurchased at the expense of violence, only half satisfied this tender andserious spirit. The headlong precipitation of a people into the truth, a‘93, terrified him; nevertheless, stagnation was still more repulsive tohim, in it he detected putrefaction and death; on the whole, he preferredscum to miasma, and he preferred the torrent to the cesspool, and thefalls of Niagara to the lake of Montfaucon. In short, he desired neitherhalt nor haste. While his tumultuous friends, captivated by the absolute,adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures, Combeferre wasinclined to let progress, good progress, take its own course; he may havebeen cold, but he was pure; methodical, but irreproachable; phlegmatic,but imperturbable. Combeferre would have knelt and clasped his hands toenable the future to arrive in all its candor, and that nothing mightdisturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races. <i>The good mustbe innocent</i>, he repeated incessantly. And in fact, if the grandeur ofthe Revolution consists in keeping the dazzling ideal fixedly in view, andof soaring thither athwart the lightnings, with fire and blood in itstalons, the beauty of progress lies in being spotless; and there existsbetween Washington, who represents the one, and Danton, who incarnates theother, that difference which separates the swan from the angel with thewings of an eagle.</p><p>Jean Prouvaire was a still softer shade than Combeferre. His name wasJehan, owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the powerfuland profound movement whence sprang the very essential study of the MiddleAges. Jean Prouvaire was in love; he cultivated a pot of flowers, playedon the flute, made verses, loved the people, pitied woman, wept over thechild, confounded God and the future in the same confidence, and blamedthe Revolution for having caused the fall of a royal head, that of AndréChénier. His voice was ordinarily delicate, but suddenly grew manly. Hewas learned even to erudition, and almost an Orientalist. Above all, hewas good; and, a very simple thing to those who know how nearly goodnessborders on grandeur, in the matter of poetry, he preferred the immense. Heknew Italian, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; and these served him only for theperusal of four poets: Dante, Juvenal, Æschylus, and Isaiah. In French, hepreferred Corneille to Racine, and Agrippa d&rsquo;Aubigné to Corneille. Heloved to saunter through fields of wild oats and corn-flowers, and busiedhimself with clouds nearly as much as with events. His mind had twoattitudes, one on the side towards man, the other on that towards God; hestudied or he contemplated. All day long, he buried himself in socialquestions, salary, capital, credit, marriage, religion, liberty ofthought, education, penal servitude, poverty, association, property,production and sharing, the enigma of this lower world which covers thehuman ant-hill with darkness; and at night, he gazed upon the planets,those enormous beings. Like Enjolras, he was wealthy and an only son. Hespoke softly, bowed his head, lowered his eyes, smiled with embarrassment,dressed badly, had an awkward air, blushed at a mere nothing, and was verytimid. Yet he was intrepid.</p><p>Feuilly was a workingman, a fan-maker, orphaned both of father and mother,who earned with difficulty three francs a day, and had but one thought, todeliver the world. He had one other preoccupation, to educate himself; hecalled this also, delivering himself. He had taught himself to read andwrite; everything that he knew, he had learned by himself. Feuilly had agenerous heart. The range of his embrace was immense. This orphan hadadopted the peoples. As his mother had failed him, he meditated on hiscountry. He brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people,over what we now call the <i>idea of the nationality</i>, had learnedhistory with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case.In this club of young Utopians, occupied chiefly with France, herepresented the outside world. He had for his specialty Greece, Poland,Hungary, Roumania, Italy. He uttered these names incessantly,appropriately and inappropriately, with the tenacity of right. Theviolations of Turkey on Greece and Thessaly, of Russia on Warsaw, ofAustria on Venice, enraged him. Above all things, the great violence of1772 aroused him. There is no more sovereign eloquence than the true inindignation; he was eloquent with that eloquence. He was inexhaustible onthat infamous date of 1772, on the subject of that noble and valiant racesuppressed by treason, and that three-sided crime, on that monstrousambush, the prototype and pattern of all those horrible suppressions ofstates, which, since that time, have struck many a noble nation, and haveannulled their certificate of birth, so to speak. All contemporary socialcrimes have their origin in the partition of Poland. The partition ofPoland is a theorem of which all present political outrages are thecorollaries. There has not been a despot, nor a traitor for nearly acentury back, who has not signed, approved, counter-signed, and copied, <i>nevariatur</i>, the partition of Poland. When the record of modern treasonswas examined, that was the first thing which made its appearance. Thecongress of Vienna consulted that crime before consummating its own. 1772sounded the onset; 1815 was the death of the game. Such was Feuilly&rsquo;shabitual text. This poor workingman had constituted himself the tutor ofJustice, and she recompensed him by rendering him great. The fact is, thatthere is eternity in right. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice canbe Teuton. Kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to makethem so. Sooner or later, the submerged part floats to the surface andreappears. Greece becomes Greece again, Italy is once more Italy. Theprotest of right against the deed persists forever. The theft of a nationcannot be allowed by prescription. These lofty deeds of rascality have nofuture. A nation cannot have its mark extracted like a pockethandkerchief.</p><p>Courfeyrac had a father who was called M. de Courfeyrac. One of the falseideas of the bourgeoisie under the Restoration as regards aristocracy andthe nobility was to believe in the particle. The particle, as every oneknows, possesses no significance. But the bourgeois of the epoch of <i>laMinerve</i> estimated so highly that poor <i>de</i>, that they thoughtthemselves bound to abdicate it. M. de Chauvelin had himself called M.Chauvelin; M. de Caumartin, M. Caumartin; M. de Constant de Robecque,Benjamin Constant; M. de Lafayette, M. Lafayette. Courfeyrac had notwished to remain behind the rest, and called himself plain Courfeyrac.</p><p>We might almost, so far as Courfeyrac is concerned, stop here, and confineourselves to saying with regard to what remains: &ldquo;For Courfeyrac, seeTholomyès.&rdquo;</p><p>Courfeyrac had, in fact, that animation of youth which may be called the<i>beauté du diable</i> of the mind. Later on, this disappears like theplayfulness of the kitten, and all this grace ends, with the bourgeois, ontwo legs, and with the tomcat, on four paws.</p><p>This sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation of thesuccessive levies of youth who traverse the schools, who pass it from handto hand, <i>quasi cursores</i>, and is almost always exactly the same; sothat, as we have just pointed out, any one who had listened to Courfeyracin 1828 would have thought he heard Tholomyès in 1817. Only, Courfeyracwas an honorable fellow. Beneath the apparent similarities of the exteriormind, the difference between him and Tholomyès was very great. The latentman which existed in the two was totally different in the first from whatit was in the second. There was in Tholomyès a district attorney, and inCourfeyrac a paladin.</p><p>Enjolras was the chief, Combeferre was the guide, Courfeyrac was thecentre. The others gave more light, he shed more warmth; the truth is,that he possessed all the qualities of a centre, roundness and radiance.</p><p>Bahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of June, 1822, on the occasion ofthe burial of young Lallemand.</p><p>Bahorel was a good-natured mortal, who kept bad company, brave, aspendthrift, prodigal, and to the verge of generosity, talkative, and attimes eloquent, bold to the verge of effrontery; the best fellow possible;he had daring waistcoats, and scarlet opinions; a wholesale blusterer,that is to say, loving nothing so much as a quarrel, unless it were anuprising; and nothing so much as an uprising, unless it were a revolution;always ready to smash a window-pane, then to tear up the pavement, then todemolish a government, just to see the effect of it; a student in hiseleventh year. He had nosed about the law, but did not practise it. He hadtaken for his device: &ldquo;Never a lawyer,&rdquo; and for his armorial bearings anightstand in which was visible a square cap. Every time that he passedthe law-school, which rarely happened, he buttoned up his frock-coat,&mdash;thepaletot had not yet been invented,&mdash;and took hygienic precautions. Ofthe school porter he said: &ldquo;What a fine old man!&rdquo; and of the dean, M.Delvincourt: &ldquo;What a monument!&rdquo; In his lectures he espied subjects forballads, and in his professors occasions for caricature. He wasted atolerably large allowance, something like three thousand francs a year, indoing nothing.</p><p>He had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with respect fortheir son.</p><p>He said of them: &ldquo;They are peasants and not bourgeois; that is the reasonthey are intelligent.&rdquo;</p><p>Bahorel, a man of caprice, was scattered over numerous cafés; the othershad habits, he had none. He sauntered. To stray is human. To saunter isParisian. In reality, he had a penetrating mind and was more of a thinkerthan appeared to view.</p><p>He served as a connecting link between the Friends of the A B C and otherstill unorganized groups, which were destined to take form later on.</p><p>In this conclave of young heads, there was one bald member.</p><p>The Marquis d&rsquo;Avaray, whom Louis XVIII. made a duke for having assistedhim to enter a hackney-coach on the day when he emigrated, was wont torelate, that in 1814, on his return to France, as the King wasdisembarking at Calais, a man handed him a petition.</p><p>&ldquo;What is your request?&rdquo; said the King.</p><p>&ldquo;Sire, a post-office.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;L&rsquo;Aigle.&rdquo;</p><p>The King frowned, glanced at the signature of the petition and beheld thename written thus: LESGLE. This non-Bonaparte orthography touched the Kingand he began to smile. &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; resumed the man with the petition, &ldquo;I hadfor ancestor a keeper of the hounds surnamed Lesgueules. This surnamefurnished my name. I am called Lesgueules, by contraction Lesgle, and bycorruption l&rsquo;Aigle.&rdquo; This caused the King to smile broadly. Later on hegave the man the posting office of Meaux, either intentionally oraccidentally.</p><p>The bald member of the group was the son of this Lesgle, or Légle, and hesigned himself, Légle [de Meaux]. As an abbreviation, his companionscalled him Bossuet.</p><p>Bossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow. His specialty was not to succeed inanything. As an offset, he laughed at everything. At five and twenty hewas bald. His father had ended by owning a house and a field; but he, theson, had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad speculation. Hehad nothing left. He possessed knowledge and wit, but all he didmiscarried. Everything failed him and everybody deceived him; what he wasbuilding tumbled down on top of him. If he were splitting wood, he cut offa finger. If he had a mistress, he speedily discovered that he had afriend also. Some misfortune happened to him every moment, hence hisjoviality. He said: &ldquo;I live under falling tiles.&rdquo; He was not easilyastonished, because, for him, an accident was what he had foreseen, hetook his bad luck serenely, and smiled at the teasing of fate, like aperson who is listening to pleasantries. He was poor, but his fund of goodhumor was inexhaustible. He soon reached his last sou, never his lastburst of laughter. When adversity entered his doors, he saluted this oldacquaintance cordially, he tapped all catastrophes on the stomach; he wasfamiliar with fatality to the point of calling it by its nickname: &ldquo;Goodday, Guignon,&rdquo; he said to it.</p><p>These persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive. He was full ofresources. He had no money, but he found means, when it seemed good tohim, to indulge in &ldquo;unbridled extravagance.&rdquo; One night, he went so far asto eat a &ldquo;hundred francs&rdquo; in a supper with a wench, which inspired him tomake this memorable remark in the midst of the orgy: &ldquo;Pull off my boots,you five-louis jade.&rdquo;</p><p>Bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of a lawyer;he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of Bahorel. Bossuet hadnot much domicile, sometimes none at all. He lodged now with one, now withanother, most often with Joly. Joly was studying medicine. He was twoyears younger than Bossuet.</p><p>Joly was the &ldquo;malade imaginaire&rdquo; junior. What he had won in medicine wasto be more of an invalid than a doctor. At three and twenty he thoughthimself a valetudinarian, and passed his life in inspecting his tongue inthe mirror. He affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle, and inhis chamber he placed his bed with its head to the south, and the foot tothe north, so that, at night, the circulation of his blood might not beinterfered with by the great electric current of the globe. During thunderstorms, he felt his pulse. Otherwise, he was the gayest of them all. Allthese young, maniacal, puny, merry incoherences lived in harmony together,and the result was an eccentric and agreeable being whom his comrades, whowere prodigal of winged consonants, called Jolllly. &ldquo;You may fly away onthe four <i>L&rsquo;s</i>,&rdquo; Jean Prouvaire said to him.<a href="#linknote-23" name="linknoteref-23" id="linknoteref-23">23</a></p><p>Joly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his cane, which isan indication of a sagacious mind.</p><p>All these young men who differed so greatly, and who, on the whole, canonly be discussed seriously, held the same religion: Progress.</p><p>All were the direct sons of the French Revolution. The most giddy of thembecame solemn when they pronounced that date: &rsquo;89. Their fathers in theflesh had been, either royalists, doctrinaires, it matters not what; thisconfusion anterior to themselves, who were young, did not concern them atall; the pure blood of principle ran in their veins. They attachedthemselves, without intermediate shades, to incorruptible right andabsolute duty.</p><p>Affiliated and initiated, they sketched out the ideal underground.</p><p>Among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds, there wasone sceptic. How came he there? By juxtaposition. This sceptic&rsquo;s name wasGrantaire, and he was in the habit of signing himself with this rebus: R.Grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in anything.Moreover, he was one of the students who had learned the most during theircourse at Paris; he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the CaféLemblin, and the best billiards at the Café Voltaire, that good cakes andlasses were to be found at the Ermitage, on the Boulevard du Maine,spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget&rsquo;s, excellent matelotes at theBarrière de la Cunette, and a certain thin white wine at the Barrière duCompat. He knew the best place for everything; in addition, boxing andfoot-fencing and some dances; and he was a thorough single-stick player.He was a tremendous drinker to boot. He was inordinately homely: theprettiest boot-stitcher of that day, Irma Boissy, enraged with hishomeliness, pronounced sentence on him as follows: &ldquo;Grantaire isimpossible&rdquo;; but Grantaire&rsquo;s fatuity was not to be disconcerted. He staredtenderly and fixedly at all women, with the air of saying to them all: &ldquo;IfI only chose!&rdquo; and of trying to make his comrades believe that he was ingeneral demand.</p><p>All those words: rights of the people, rights of man, the social contract,the French Revolution, the Republic, democracy, humanity, civilization,religion, progress, came very near to signifying nothing whatever toGrantaire. He smiled at them. Scepticism, that caries of the intelligence,had not left him a single whole idea. He lived with irony. This was hisaxiom: &ldquo;There is but one certainty, my full glass.&rdquo; He sneered at alldevotion in all parties, the father as well as the brother, Robespierrejunior as well as Loizerolles. &ldquo;They are greatly in advance to be dead,&rdquo; he exclaimed. He said of the crucifix: &ldquo;There is a gibbet which has been asuccess.&rdquo; A rover, a gambler, a libertine, often drunk, he displeasedthese young dreamers by humming incessantly: &ldquo;J&rsquo;aimons les filles, etj&rsquo;aimons le bon vin.&rdquo; Air: Vive Henri IV.</p><p>However, this sceptic had one fanaticism. This fanaticism was neither adogma, nor an idea, nor an art, nor a science; it was a man: Enjolras.Grantaire admired, loved, and venerated Enjolras. To whom did thisanarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds? To themost absolute. In what manner had Enjolras subjugated him? By his ideas?No. By his character. A phenomenon which is often observable. A scepticwho adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of complementary colors.That which we lack attracts us. No one loves the light like the blind man.The dwarf adores the drum-major. The toad always has his eyes fixed onheaven. Why? In order to watch the bird in its flight. Grantaire, in whomwrithed doubt, loved to watch faith soar in Enjolras. He had need ofEnjolras. That chaste, healthy, firm, upright, hard, candid nature charmedhim, without his being clearly aware of it, and without the idea ofexplaining it to himself having occurred to him. He admired his oppositeby instinct. His soft, yielding, dislocated, sickly, shapeless ideasattached themselves to Enjolras as to a spinal column. His moral backboneleaned on that firmness. Grantaire in the presence of Enjolras became someone once more. He was, himself, moreover, composed of two elements, whichwere, to all appearance, incompatible. He was ironical and cordial. Hisindifference loved. His mind could get along without belief, but his heartcould not get along without friendship. A profound contradiction; for anaffection is a conviction. His nature was thus constituted. There are menwho seem to be born to be the reverse, the obverse, the wrong side. Theyare Pollux, Patrocles, Nisus, Eudamidas, Ephestion, Pechmeja. They onlyexist on condition that they are backed up with another man; their name isa sequel, and is only written preceded by the conjunction <i>and</i>; andtheir existence is not their own; it is the other side of an existencewhich is not theirs. Grantaire was one of these men. He was the obverse ofEnjolras.</p><p>One might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of thealphabet. In the series O and P are inseparable. You can, at will,pronounce O and P or Orestes and Pylades.</p><p>Grantaire, Enjolras&rsquo; true satellite, inhabited this circle of young men;he lived there, he took no pleasure anywhere but there; he followed themeverywhere. His joy was to see these forms go and come through the fumesof wine. They tolerated him on account of his good humor.</p><p>Enjolras, the believer, disdained this sceptic; and, a sober man himself,scorned this drunkard. He accorded him a little lofty pity. Grantaire wasan unaccepted Pylades. Always harshly treated by Enjolras, roughlyrepulsed, rejected yet ever returning to the charge, he said of Enjolras:&ldquo;What fine marble!&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0177" id="link2HCH0177"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;BLONDEAU&rsquo;S FUNERAL ORATION BY BOSSUET</h3><p>On a certain afternoon, which had, as will be seen hereafter, somecoincidence with the events heretofore related, Laigle de Meaux was to beseen leaning in a sensual manner against the doorpost of the Café Musain.He had the air of a caryatid on a vacation; he carried nothing but hisreverie, however. He was staring at the Place Saint-Michel. To lean one&rsquo;sback against a thing is equivalent to lying down while standing erect,which attitude is not hated by thinkers. Laigle de Meaux was ponderingwithout melancholy, over a little misadventure which had befallen him twodays previously at the law-school, and which had modified his personalplans for the future, plans which were rather indistinct in any case.</p><p>Reverie does not prevent a cab from passing by, nor the dreamer from takingnote of that cab. Laigle de Meaux, whose eyes were straying about in asort of diffuse lounging, perceived, athwart his somnambulism, atwo-wheeled vehicle proceeding through the place, at a foot pace andapparently in indecision. For whom was this cabriolet? Why was it drivingat a walk? Laigle took a survey. In it, beside the coachman, sat a youngman, and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky hand-bag. The bagdisplayed to passers-by the following name inscribed in large blackletters on a card which was sewn to the stuff: MARIUS PONTMERCY.</p><p>This name caused Laigle to change his attitude. He drew himself up andhurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Marius Pontmercy!&rdquo;</p><p>The cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt.</p><p>The young man, who also seemed deeply buried in thought, raised his eyes:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;You are M. Marius Pontmercy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was looking for you,&rdquo; resumed Laigle de Meaux.</p><p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; demanded Marius; for it was he: in fact, he had just quitted hisgrandfather&rsquo;s, and had before him a face which he now beheld for the firsttime. &ldquo;I do not know you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Neither do I know you,&rdquo; responded Laigle.</p><p>Marius thought he had encountered a wag, the beginning of a mystificationin the open street. He was not in a very good humor at the moment. Hefrowned. Laigle de Meaux went on imperturbably:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You were not at the school day before yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is possible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is certain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are a student?&rdquo; demanded Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Like yourself. Day before yesterday, I entered the school, bychance. You know, one does have such freaks sometimes. The professor wasjust calling the roll. You are not unaware that they are very ridiculouson such occasions. At the third call, unanswered, your name is erased fromthe list. Sixty francs in the gulf.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius began to listen.</p><p>&ldquo;It was Blondeau who was making the call. You know Blondeau, he has a verypointed and very malicious nose, and he delights to scent out the absent.He slyly began with the letter P. I was not listening, not beingcompromised by that letter. The call was not going badly. No erasures; theuniverse was present. Blondeau was grieved. I said to myself: &lsquo;Blondeau,my love, you will not get the very smallest sort of an execution to-day.&rsquo;All at once Blondeau calls, &lsquo;Marius Pontmercy!&rsquo; No one answers. Blondeau,filled with hope, repeats more loudly: &lsquo;Marius Pontmercy!&rsquo; And he takeshis pen. Monsieur, I have bowels of compassion. I said to myself hastily:‘Here&rsquo;s a brave fellow who is going to get scratched out. Attention. Hereis a veritable mortal who is not exact. He&rsquo;s not a good student. Here isnone of your heavy-sides, a student who studies, a greenhorn pedant,strong on letters, theology, science, and sapience, one of those dull witscut by the square; a pin by profession. He is an honorable idler wholounges, who practises country jaunts, who cultivates the grisette, whopays court to the fair sex, who is at this very moment, perhaps, with mymistress. Let us save him. Death to Blondeau!&rsquo; At that moment, Blondeaudipped his pen in, all black with erasures in the ink, cast his yelloweyes round the audience room, and repeated for the third time: &lsquo;MariusPontmercy!&rsquo; I replied: &lsquo;Present!&rsquo; This is why you were not crossed off.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur!&mdash;&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;And why I was,&rdquo; added Laigle de Meaux.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>Laigle resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing is more simple. I was close to the desk to reply, and close tothe door for the purpose of flight. The professor gazed at me with acertain intensity. All of a sudden, Blondeau, who must be the maliciousnose alluded to by Boileau, skipped to the letter L. L is my letter. I amfrom Meaux, and my name is Lesgle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;L&rsquo;Aigle!&rdquo; interrupted Marius, &ldquo;what fine name!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur, Blondeau came to this fine name, and called: &lsquo;Laigle!&rsquo; I reply:‘Present!&rsquo; Then Blondeau gazes at me, with the gentleness of a tiger, andsays to me: &lsquo;If you are Pontmercy, you are not Laigle.&rsquo; A phrase which hasa disobliging air for you, but which was lugubrious only for me. Thatsaid, he crossed me off.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am mortified, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; interposed Laigle, &ldquo;I demand permission to embalm Blondeauin a few phrases of deeply felt eulogium. I will assume that he is dead.There will be no great change required in his gauntness, in his pallor, inhis coldness, and in his smell. And I say: &lsquo;<i>Erudimini qui judicatisterram</i>. Here lies Blondeau, Blondeau the Nose, Blondeau Nasica, the oxof discipline, <i>bos disciplinæ</i>, the bloodhound of the password, theangel of the roll-call, who was upright, square, exact, rigid, honest, andhideous. God crossed him off as he crossed me off.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Marius resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am very sorry&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said Laigle de Meaux, &ldquo;let this serve you as a lesson.

I was on the brink of becoming a lawyer. This erasuresaves me. I renounce the triumphs of the bar. I shall not defend thewidow, and I shall not attack the orphan. No more toga, no more stage.Here is my erasure all ready for me. It is to you that I am indebted forit, Monsieur Pontmercy. I intend to pay a solemn call of thanks upon you.Where do you live?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In this cab,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;A sign of opulence,&rdquo; retorted Laigle calmly. &ldquo;I congratulate you. Youhave there a rent of nine thousand francs per annum.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, Courfeyrac emerged from the café.</p><p>Marius smiled sadly.</p><p>&ldquo;I have paid this rent for the last two hours, and I aspire to get rid ofit; but there is a sort of history attached to it, and I don&rsquo;t know whereto go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come to my place, sir,&rdquo; said Courfeyrac.</p><p>&ldquo;I have the priority,&rdquo; observed Laigle, &ldquo;but I have no home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Bossuet,&rdquo; said Courfeyrac.</p><p>&ldquo;Bossuet,&rdquo; said Marius, &ldquo;but I thought that your name was Laigle.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;De Meaux,&rdquo; replied Laigle; &ldquo;by metaphor, Bossuet.&rdquo;</p><p>Courfeyrac entered the cab.</p><p>&ldquo;Coachman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques.&rdquo;</p><p>And that very evening, Marius found himself installed in a chamber of thehotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques side by side with Courfeyrac.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0178" id="link2HCH0178"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;MARIUS&rsquo; ASTONISHMENTS</h3><p>In a few days, Marius had become Courfeyrac&rsquo;s friend. Youth is the seasonfor prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars. Marius breathed freelyin Courfeyrac&rsquo;s society, a decidedly new thing for him. Courfeyrac put noquestions to him. He did not even think of such a thing. At that age,faces disclose everything on the spot. Words are superfluous. There areyoung men of whom it can be said that their countenances chatter. Onelooks at them and one knows them.</p><p>One morning, however, Courfeyrac abruptly addressed this interrogation tohim:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;By the way, have you any political opinions?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The idea!&rdquo; said Marius, almost affronted by the question.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A democrat-Bonapartist.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The gray hue of a reassured rat,&rdquo; said Courfeyrac.</p><p>On the following day, Courfeyrac introduced Marius at the Café Musain.Then he whispered in his ear, with a smile: &ldquo;I must give you your entry tothe revolution.&rdquo; And he led him to the hall of the Friends of the A B C.He presented him to the other comrades, saying this simple word whichMarius did not understand: &ldquo;A pupil.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius had fallen into a wasps&rsquo;-nest of wits. However, although he wassilent and grave, he was, nonetheless, both winged and armed.</p><p>Marius, up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy, and to asides,both by habit and by taste, was a little fluttered by this covey of youngmen around him. All these various initiatives solicited his attention atonce, and pulled him about. The tumultuous movements of these minds atliberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl. Sometimes, in his trouble,they fled so far from him, that he had difficulty in recovering them. Heheard them talk of philosophy, of literature, of art, of history, ofreligion, in unexpected fashion. He caught glimpses of strange aspects;and, as he did not place them in proper perspective, he was not altogethersure that it was not chaos that he grasped. On abandoning hisgrandfather&rsquo;s opinions for the opinions of his father, he had supposedhimself fixed; he now suspected, with uneasiness, and without daring toavow it to himself, that he was not. The angle at which he saw everythingbegan to be displaced anew. A certain oscillation set all the horizons ofhis brains in motion. An odd internal upsetting. He almost suffered fromit.</p><p>It seemed as though there were no &ldquo;consecrated things&rdquo; for those youngmen. Marius heard singular propositions on every sort of subject, whichembarrassed his still timid mind.</p><p>A theatre poster presented itself, adorned with the title of a tragedyfrom the ancient repertory called classic: &ldquo;Down with tragedy dear to thebourgeois!&rdquo; cried Bahorel. And Marius heard Combeferre reply:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You are wrong, Bahorel. The bourgeoisie loves tragedy, and thebourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score. Bewigged tragedy has areason for its existence, and I am not one of those who, by order ofÆschylus, contest its right to existence. There are rough outlines innature; there are, in creation, ready-made parodies; a beak which is not abeak, wings which are not wings, gills which are not gills, paws which arenot paws, a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh, there is theduck. Now, since poultry exists by the side of the bird, I do not see whyclassic tragedy should not exist in the face of antique tragedy.&rdquo;</p><p>Or chance decreed that Marius should traverse Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseaubetween Enjolras and Courfeyrac.</p><p>Courfeyrac took his arm:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Pay attention. This is the Rue Plâtrière, now called Rue Jean-JacquesRousseau, on account of a singular household which lived in it sixty yearsago. This consisted of Jean-Jacques and Thérèse. From time to time, littlebeings were born there. Thérèse gave birth to them, Jean-Jacquesrepresented them as foundlings.&rdquo;</p><p>And Enjolras addressed Courfeyrac roughly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Silence in the presence of Jean-Jacques! I admire that man. He denied hisown children, that may be; but he adopted the people.&rdquo;</p><p>Not one of these young men articulated the word: The Emperor. JeanProuvaire alone sometimes said Napoleon; all the others said &ldquo;Bonaparte.&rdquo; Enjolras pronounced it &ldquo;Buonaparte.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius was vaguely surprised. <i>Initium sapientiæ</i>.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0179" id="link2HCH0179"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE BACK ROOM OF THE CAFÉ MUSAIN</h3><p>One of the conversations among the young men, at which Marius was presentand in which he sometimes joined, was a veritable shock to his mind.</p><p>This took place in the back room of the Café Musain. Nearly all theFriends of the A B C had convened that evening. The argand lamp wassolemnly lighted. They talked of one thing and another, without passionand with noise. With the exception of Enjolras and Marius, who held theirpeace, all were haranguing rather at hap-hazard. Conversations betweencomrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults. It was a gameand an uproar as much as a conversation. They tossed words to each otherand caught them up in turn. They were chattering in all quarters.</p><p>No woman was admitted to this back room, except Louison, the dish-washerof the café, who passed through it from time to time, to go to her washingin the &ldquo;lavatory.&rdquo;</p><p>Grantaire, thoroughly drunk, was deafening the corner of which he hadtaken possession, reasoning and contradicting at the top of his lungs, andshouting:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am thirsty. Mortals, I am dreaming: that the tun of Heidelberg has anattack of apoplexy, and that I am one of the dozen leeches which will beapplied to it. I want a drink. I desire to forget life. Life is a hideousinvention of I know not whom. It lasts no time at all, and is worth nothing.One breaks one&rsquo;s neck in living. Life is a theatre set in which there arebut few practicable entrances. Happiness is an antique reliquary painted on oneside only. Ecclesiastes says: &lsquo;All is vanity.&rsquo; I agree with thatgood man, who never existed, perhaps. Zero not wishing to go stark naked,clothed himself in vanity. O vanity! The patching up of everything with bigwords! a kitchen is a laboratory, a dancer is a professor, an acrobat is agymnast, a boxer is a pugilist, an apothecary is a chemist, a wigmaker is anartist, a hodman is an architect, a jockey is a sportsman, a wood-louse is apterigybranche. Vanity has a right and a wrong side; the right side is stupid,it is the negro with his glass beads; the wrong side is foolish, it is thephilosopher with his rags. I weep over the one and I laugh over the other. Whatare called honors and dignities, and even dignity and honor, are generally ofpinchbeck. Kings make playthings of human pride. Caligula made a horse aconsul; Charles II. made a knight of a sirloin. Wrap yourself up now, then,between Consul Incitatus and Baronet Roastbeef. As for the intrinsic value ofpeople, it is no longer respectable in the least. Listen to the panegyric whichneighbor makes of neighbor. White on white is ferocious; if the lily couldspeak, what a setting down it would give the dove! A bigoted woman prating of adevout woman is more venomous than the asp and the cobra. It is a shame that Iam ignorant, otherwise I would quote to you a mass of things; but I knownothing. For instance, I have always been witty; when I was a pupil of Gros,instead of daubing wretched little pictures, I passed my time in pilferingapples; <i>rapin</i><a href="#linknote-24" name="linknoteref-24" id="linknoteref-24">24</a>is the masculine of <i>rapine</i>. So much for myself; as for the rest of you,you are worth no more than I am. I scoff at your perfections, excellencies, andqualities. Every good quality tends towards a defect; economy borders onavarice, the generous man is next door to the prodigal, the brave man rubselbows with the braggart; he who says very pious says a trifle bigoted; thereare just as many vices in virtue as there are holes in Diogenes&rsquo; cloak.Whom do you admire, the slain or the slayer, Cæsar or Brutus? Generally men arein favor of the slayer. Long live Brutus, he has slain! There lies the virtue.Virtue, granted, but madness also. There are queer spots on those great men.The Brutus who killed Cæsar was in love with the statue of a little boy. Thisstatue was from the hand of the Greek sculptor Strongylion, who also carvedthat figure of an Amazon known as the Beautiful Leg, Eucnemos, which Nerocarried with him in his travels. This Strongylion left but two statues whichplaced Nero and Brutus in accord. Brutus was in love with the one, Nero withthe other. All history is nothing but wearisome repetition. One century is theplagiarist of the other. The battle of Marengo copies the battle of Pydna; theTolbiac of Clovis and the Austerlitz of Napoleon are as like each other as twodrops of water. I don&rsquo;t attach much importance to victory. Nothing is sostupid as to conquer; true glory lies in convincing. But try to provesomething! If you are content with success, what mediocrity, and withconquering, what wretchedness! Alas, vanity and cowardice everywhere.Everything obeys success, even grammar. <i>Si volet usus</i>, says Horace.Therefore I disdain the human race. Shall we descend to the party at all? Doyou wish me to begin admiring the peoples? What people, if you please? Shall itbe Greece? The Athenians, those Parisians of days gone by, slew Phocion, as wemight say Coligny, and fawned upon tyrants to such an extent that Anacephorussaid of Pisistratus: &ldquo;His urine attracts the bees.&rdquo; The mostprominent man in Greece for fifty years was that grammarian Philetas, who wasso small and so thin that he was obliged to load his shoes with lead in ordernot to be blown away by the wind. There stood on the great square in Corinth astatue carved by Silanion and catalogued by Pliny; this statue representedEpisthates. What did Episthates do? He invented a trip. That sums up Greece andglory. Let us pass on to others. Shall I admire England? Shall I admire France?France? Why? Because of Paris? I have just told you my opinion of Athens.England? Why? Because of London? I hate Carthage. And then, London, themetropolis of luxury, is the headquarters of wretchedness. There are a hundreddeaths a year of hunger in the parish of Charing-Cross alone. Such is Albion. Iadd, as the climax, that I have seen an Englishwoman dancing in a wreath ofroses and blue spectacles. A fig then for England! If I do not admire JohnBull, shall I admire Brother Jonathan? I have but little taste for thatslave-holding brother. Take away <i>Time is money</i>, what remains of England?Take away <i>Cotton is king</i>, what remains of America? Germany is the lymph,Italy is the bile. Shall we go into ecstasies over Russia? Voltaire admired it.He also admired China. I admit that Russia has its beauties, among others, astout despotism; but I pity the despots. Their health is delicate. Adecapitated Alexis, a poignarded Peter, a strangled Paul, another Paul crushedflat with kicks, divers Ivans strangled, with their throats cut, numerousNicholases and Basils poisoned, all this indicates that the palace of theEmperors of Russia is in a condition of flagrant insalubrity. All civilizedpeoples offer this detail to the admiration of the thinker; war; now, war,civilized war, exhausts and sums up all the forms of ruffianism, from thebrigandage of the Trabuceros in the gorges of Mont Jaxa to the marauding of theComanche Indians in the Doubtful Pass. &lsquo;Bah!&rsquo; you will say to me,&lsquo;but Europe is certainly better than Asia?&rsquo; I admit that Asia is afarce; but I do not precisely see what you find to laugh at in the Grand Lama,you peoples of the west, who have mingled with your fashions and your elegancesall the complicated filth of majesty, from the dirty chemise of Queen Isabellato the chamber-chair of the Dauphin. Gentlemen of the human race, I tell you,not a bit of it! It is at Brussels that the most beer is consumed, at Stockholmthe most brandy, at Madrid the most chocolate, at Amsterdam the most gin, atLondon the most wine, at Constantinople the most coffee, at Paris the mostabsinthe; there are all the useful notions. Paris carries the day, in short. InParis, even the rag-pickers are sybarites; Diogenes would have loved to be arag-picker of the Place Maubert better than to be a philosopher at the Piræus.Learn this in addition; the wineshops of the rag-pickers are called<i>bibines</i>; the most celebrated are the <i>Saucepan</i> and <i>TheSlaughter-House</i>. Hence, tea-gardens, goguettes, caboulots, bouibuis,mastroquets, bastringues, manezingues, bibines of the rag-pickers,caravanseries of the caliphs, I certify to you, I am a voluptuary, I eat atRichard&rsquo;s at forty sous a head, I must have Persian carpets to roll nakedCleopatra in! Where is Cleopatra? Ah! So it is you, Louison. Good day.&rdquo;</p><p>Thus did Grantaire, more than intoxicated, launch into speech, catching atthe dish-washer in her passage, from his corner in the back room of theCafé Musain.</p><p>Bossuet, extending his hand towards him, tried to impose silence on him,and Grantaire began again worse than ever:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Aigle de Meaux, down with your paws. You produce on me no effect withyour gesture of Hippocrates refusing Artaxerxes&rsquo; bric-à-brac. I excuse youfrom the task of soothing me. Moreover, I am sad. What do you wish me tosay to you? Man is evil, man is deformed; the butterfly is a success, manis a failure. God made a mistake with that animal. A crowd offers a choiceof ugliness. The first comer is a wretch, <i>Femme</i>&mdash;woman&mdash;rhymeswith <i>infâme</i>,&mdash;infamous. Yes, I have the spleen, complicatedwith melancholy, with homesickness, plus hypochondria, and I am vexed andI rage, and I yawn, and I am bored, and I am tired to death, and I amstupid! Let God go to the devil!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Silence then, capital R!&rdquo; resumed Bossuet, who was discussing a point oflaw behind the scenes, and who was plunged more than waist high in aphrase of judicial slang, of which this is the conclusion:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;And as for me, although I am hardly a legist, and at the most, anamateur attorney, I maintain this: that, in accordance with the terms ofthe customs of Normandy, at Saint-Michel, and for each year, an equivalentmust be paid to the profit of the lord of the manor, saving the rights ofothers, and by all and several, the proprietors as well as those seizedwith inheritance, and that, for all emphyteuses, leases, freeholds,contracts of domain, mortgages&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Echo, plaintive nymph,&rdquo; hummed Grantaire.</p><p>Near Grantaire, an almost silent table, a sheet of paper, an inkstand anda pen between two glasses of brandy, announced that a vaudeville was beingsketched out.</p><p>This great affair was being discussed in a low voice, and the two heads atwork touched each other: &ldquo;Let us begin by finding names. When one has thenames, one finds the subject.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true. Dictate. I will write.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Dorimon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;An independent gentleman?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;His daughter, Célestine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;tine. What next?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Colonel Sainval.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sainval is stale. I should say Valsin.&rdquo;</p><p>Beside the vaudeville aspirants, another group, which was also takingadvantage of the uproar to talk low, was discussing a duel. An old fellowof thirty was counselling a young one of eighteen, and explaining to himwhat sort of an adversary he had to deal with.</p><p>&ldquo;The deuce! Look out for yourself. He is a fine swordsman. His play isneat. He has the attack, no wasted feints, wrist, dash, lightning, a justparade, mathematical parries, <i>bigre!</i> and he is left-handed.&rdquo;</p><p>In the angle opposite Grantaire, Joly and Bahorel were playing dominoes,and talking of love.</p><p>&ldquo;You are in luck, that you are,&rdquo; Joly was saying. &ldquo;You have a mistress whois always laughing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is a fault of hers,&rdquo; returned Bahorel. &ldquo;One&rsquo;s mistress does wrong tolaugh. That encourages one to deceive her. To see her gay removes yourremorse; if you see her sad, your conscience pricks you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ingrate! a woman who laughs is such a good thing! And you never quarrel!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is because of the treaty which we have made. On forming our littleHoly Alliance we assigned ourselves each our frontier, which we nevercross. What is situated on the side of winter belongs to Vaud, on the sideof the wind to Gex. Hence the peace.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Peace is happiness digesting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you, Jolllly, where do you stand in your entanglement with Mamselle&mdash;youknow whom I mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She sulks at me with cruel patience.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yet you are a lover to soften the heart with gauntness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In your place, I would let her alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is easy enough to say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And to do. Is not her name Musichetta?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. Ah! my poor Bahorel, she is a superb girl, very literary, with tinyfeet, little hands, she dresses well, and is white and dimpled, with theeyes of a fortune-teller. I am wild over her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, then in order to please her, you must be elegant, andproduce effects with your knees. Buy a good pair of trousers ofdouble-milled cloth at Staub&rsquo;s. That will assist.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At what price?&rdquo; shouted Grantaire.</p><p>The third corner was delivered up to a poetical discussion. Paganmythology was giving battle to Christian mythology. The question was aboutOlympus, whose part was taken by Jean Prouvaire, out of pure romanticism.</p><p>Jean Prouvaire was timid only in repose. Once excited, he burst forth, asort of mirth accentuated his enthusiasm, and he was at once both laughingand lyric.</p><p>&ldquo;Let us not insult the gods,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The gods may not have taken theirdeparture. Jupiter does not impress me as dead. The gods are dreams, yousay. Well, even in nature, such as it is to-day, after the flight of thesedreams, we still find all the grand old pagan myths. Such and such amountain with the profile of a citadel, like the Vignemale, for example,is still to me the headdress of Cybele; it has not been proved to me thatPan does not come at night to breathe into the hollow trunks of thewillows, stopping up the holes in turn with his fingers, and I have alwaysbelieved that Io had something to do with the cascade of Pissevache.&rdquo;</p><p>In the last corner, they were talking politics. The Charter which had beengranted was getting roughly handled. Combeferre was upholding it weakly.Courfeyrac was energetically making a breach in it. On the table lay anunfortunate copy of the famous Touquet Charter. Courfeyrac had seized it,and was brandishing it, mingling with his arguments the rattling of thissheet of paper.</p><p>&ldquo;In the first place, I won&rsquo;t have any kings; if it were only from aneconomical point of view, I don&rsquo;t want any; a king is a parasite. One doesnot have kings gratis. Listen to this: the dearness of kings. At the deathof François I., the national debt of France amounted to an income ofthirty thousand livres; at the death of Louis XIV. it was two milliards,six hundred millions, at twenty-eight livres the mark, which wasequivalent in 1760, according to Desmarets, to four milliards, fivehundred millions, which would to-day be equivalent to twelve milliards. Inthe second place, and no offence to Combeferre, a charter granted is but apoor expedient of civilization. To save the transition, to soften thepassage, to deaden the shock, to cause the nation to pass insensibly fromthe monarchy to democracy by the practice of constitutional fictions,&mdash;whatdetestable reasons all those are! No! no! let us never enlighten thepeople with false daylight. Principles dwindle and pale in yourconstitutional cellar. No illegitimacy, no compromise, no grant from theking to the people. In all such grants there is an Article 14. By the sideof the hand which gives there is the claw which snatches back. I refuseyour charter point-blank. A charter is a mask; the lie lurks beneath it. Apeople which accepts a charter abdicates. The law is only the law whenentire. No! no charter!&rdquo;</p><p>It was winter; a couple of fagots were crackling in the fireplace. Thiswas tempting, and Courfeyrac could not resist. He crumpled the poorTouquet Charter in his fist, and flung it in the fire. The paper flashedup. Combeferre watched the masterpiece of Louis XVIII. burnphilosophically, and contented himself with saying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The charter metamorphosed into flame.&rdquo;</p><p>And sarcasms, sallies, jests, that French thing which is called <i>entrain</i>,and that English thing which is called humor, good and bad taste, good andbad reasons, all the wild pyrotechnics of dialogue, mounting together andcrossing from all points of the room, produced a sort of merry bombardmentover their heads.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0180" id="link2HCH0180"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;ENLARGEMENT OF HORIZON</h3><p>The shocks of youthful minds among themselves have this admirableproperty, that one can never foresee the spark, nor divine the lightningflash. What will dart out presently? No one knows. The burst of laughterstarts from a tender feeling.</p><p>At the moment of jest, the serious makes its entry. Impulses depend on thefirst chance word. The spirit of each is sovereign, jest suffices to openthe field to the unexpected. These are conversations with abrupt turns, inwhich the perspective changes suddenly. Chance is the stage-manager ofsuch conversations.</p><p>A severe thought, starting oddly from a clash of words, suddenly traversedthe conflict of quips in which Grantaire, Bahorel, Prouvaire, Bossuet,Combeferre, and Courfeyrac were confusedly fencing.</p><p>How does a phrase crop up in a dialogue? Whence comes it that it suddenlyimpresses itself on the attention of those who hear it? We have just said,that no one knows anything about it. In the midst of the uproar, Bossuetall at once terminated some apostrophe to Combeferre, with this date:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;June 18th, 1815, Waterloo.&rdquo;</p><p>At this name of Waterloo, Marius, who was leaning his elbows on a table,beside a glass of water, removed his wrist from beneath his chin, andbegan to gaze fixedly at the audience.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardieu!&rdquo; exclaimed Courfeyrac (&ldquo;Parbleu&rdquo; was falling into disuse at thisperiod), &ldquo;that number 18 is strange and strikes me. It is Bonaparte&rsquo;sfatal number. Place Louis in front and Brumaire behind, you have the wholedestiny of the man, with this significant peculiarity, that the end treadsclose on the heels of the commencement.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras, who had remained mute up to that point, broke the silence andaddressed this remark to Combeferre:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You mean to say, the crime and the expiation.&rdquo;</p><p>This word <i>crime</i> overpassed the measure of what Marius, who wasalready greatly agitated by the abrupt evocation of Waterloo, couldaccept.</p><p>He rose, walked slowly to the map of France spread out on the wall, and atwhose base an island was visible in a separate compartment, laid hisfinger on this compartment and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Corsica, a little island which has rendered France very great.&rdquo;</p><p>This was like a breath of icy air. All ceased talking. They felt thatsomething was on the point of occurring.</p><p>Bahorel, replying to Bossuet, was just assuming an attitude of the torsoto which he was addicted. He gave it up to listen.</p><p>Enjolras, whose blue eye was not fixed on any one, and who seemed to begazing at space, replied, without glancing at Marius:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;France needs no Corsica to be great. France is great because she isFrance. <i>Quia nomina leo</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius felt no desire to retreat; he turned towards Enjolras, and hisvoice burst forth with a vibration which came from a quiver of his verybeing:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;God forbid that I should diminish France! But amalgamating Napoleon withher is not diminishing her. Come! let us argue the question. I am anewcomer among you, but I will confess that you amaze me. Where do we stand?Who are we? Who are you? Who am I? Let us come to an explanation about theEmperor. I hear you say <i>Buonaparte</i>, accenting the <i>u</i> like theRoyalists. I warn you that my grandfather does better still; he says <i>Buonaparté</i>&rsquo;.I thought you were young men. Where, then, is your enthusiasm? And whatare you doing with it? Whom do you admire, if you do not admire theEmperor? And what more do you want? If you will have none of that greatman, what great men would you like? He had everything. He was complete. Hehad in his brain the sum of human faculties. He made codes like Justinian,he dictated like Cæsar, his conversation was mingled with thelightning-flash of Pascal, with the thunderclap of Tacitus, he madehistory and he wrote it, his bulletins are Iliads, he combined the cipherof Newton with the metaphor of Mahomet, he left behind him in the Eastwords as great as the pyramids, at Tilsit he taught Emperors majesty, atthe Academy of Sciences he replied to Laplace, in the Council of State heheld his own against Merlin, he gave a soul to the geometry of the first,and to the chicanery of the last, he was a legist with the attorneys andsidereal with the astronomers; like Cromwell blowing out one of twocandles, he went to the Temple to bargain for a curtain tassel; he saweverything; he knew everything; which did not prevent him from laughinggood-naturedly beside the cradle of his little child; and all at once,frightened Europe lent an ear, armies put themselves in motion, parks ofartillery rumbled, pontoons stretched over the rivers, clouds of cavalrygalloped in the storm, cries, trumpets, a trembling of thrones in everydirection, the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map, the sound of asuperhuman sword was heard, as it was drawn from its sheath; they beheldhim, him, rise erect on the horizon with a blazing brand in his hand, anda glow in his eyes, unfolding amid the thunder, his two wings, the grandarmy and the old guard, and he was the archangel of war!&rdquo;</p><p>All held their peace, and Enjolras bowed his head. Silence always producessomewhat the effect of acquiescence, of the enemy being driven to thewall. Marius continued with increased enthusiasm, and almost withoutpausing for breath:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us be just, my friends! What a splendid destiny for a nation to bethe Empire of such an Emperor, when that nation is France and when it addsits own genius to the genius of that man! To appear and to reign, to marchand to triumph, to have for halting-places all capitals, to take hisgrenadiers and to make kings of them, to decree the falls of dynasties,and to transfigure Europe at the pace of a charge; to make you feel thatwhen you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of the sword of God; tofollow in a single man, Hannibal, Cæsar, Charlemagne; to be the people ofsome one who mingles with your dawns the startling announcement of abattle won, to have the cannon of the Invalides to rouse you in themorning, to hurl into abysses of light prodigious words which flameforever, Marengo, Arcola, Austerlitz, Jena, Wagram! To causeconstellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the zenithof the centuries, to make the French Empire a pendant to the Roman Empire,to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand army, to make itslegions fly forth over all the earth, as a mountain sends out its eagleson all sides to conquer, to dominate, to strike with lightning, to be inEurope a sort of nation gilded through glory, to sound athwart thecenturies a trumpet-blast of Titans, to conquer the world twice, byconquest and by dazzling, that is sublime; and what greater thing isthere?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To be free,&rdquo; said Combeferre.</p><p>Marius lowered his head in his turn; that cold and simple word hadtraversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel, and he felt itvanishing within him. When he raised his eyes, Combeferre was no longerthere. Probably satisfied with his reply to the apotheosis, he had justtaken his departure, and all, with the exception of Enjolras, had followedhim. The room had been emptied. Enjolras, left alone with Marius, wasgazing gravely at him. Marius, however, having rallied his ideas to someextent, did not consider himself beaten; there lingered in him a trace ofinward fermentation which was on the point, no doubt, of translatingitself into syllogisms arrayed against Enjolras, when all of a sudden,they heard some one singing on the stairs as he went. It was Combeferre,and this is what he was singing:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Si César m&rsquo;avait donné<br/>    La gloire et la guerre,<br/>Et qu&rsquo;il me fallait quitter<br/>    L&rsquo;amour de ma mère,<br/>Je dirais au grand César:<br/>    Reprends ton sceptre et ton char,<br/>J&rsquo;aime mieux ma mère, ô gué!<br/>    J&rsquo;aime mieux ma mère!&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-25" name="linknoteref-25" id="linknoteref-25">25</a></p><p>The wild and tender accents with which Combeferre sang communicated tothis couplet a sort of strange grandeur. Marius, thoughtfully, and withhis eyes diked on the ceiling, repeated almost mechanically: &ldquo;My mother?&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, he felt Enjolras&rsquo; hand on his shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Citizen,&rdquo; said Enjolras to him, &ldquo;my mother is the Republic.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0181" id="link2HCH0181"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;RES ANGUSTA</h3><p>That evening left Marius profoundly shaken, and with a melancholy shadowin his soul. He felt what the earth may possibly feel, at the moment whenit is torn open with the iron, in order that grain may be deposited withinit; it feels only the wound; the quiver of the germ and the joy of thefruit only arrive later.</p><p>Marius was gloomy. He had but just acquired a faith; must he then rejectit already? He affirmed to himself that he would not. He declared tohimself that he would not doubt, and he began to doubt in spite ofhimself. To stand between two religions, from one of which you have not asyet emerged, and another into which you have not yet entered, isintolerable; and twilight is pleasing only to bat-like souls. Marius wasclear-eyed, and he required the true light. The half-lights of doubtpained him. Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was, hecould not halt there, he was irresistibly constrained to continue, toadvance, to examine, to think, to march further. Whither would this leadhim? He feared, after having taken so many steps which had brought himnearer to his father, to now take a step which should estrange him fromthat father. His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections whichoccurred to him. An escarpment rose around him. He was in accord neitherwith his grandfather nor with his friends; daring in the eyes of the one,he was behind the times in the eyes of the others, and he recognized thefact that he was doubly isolated, on the side of age and on the side ofyouth. He ceased to go to the Café Musain.</p><p>In the troubled state of his conscience, he no longer thought of certainserious sides of existence. The realities of life do not allow themselvesto be forgotten. They soon elbowed him abruptly.</p><p>One morning, the proprietor of the hotel entered Marius&rsquo; room and said tohim:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Courfeyrac answered for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I must have my money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Request Courfeyrac to come and talk with me,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>Courfeyrac having made his appearance, the host left them. Marius thentold him what it had not before occurred to him to relate, that he was thesame as alone in the world, and had no relatives.</p><p>&ldquo;What is to become of you?&rdquo; said Courfeyrac.</p><p>&ldquo;I do not know in the least,&rdquo; replied Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you any money?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fifteen francs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want me to lend you some?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you clothes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here is what I have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you trinkets?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A watch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Silver?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gold; here it is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know a clothes-dealer who will take your frock-coat and a pair oftrousers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will then have only a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a hat and acoat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And my boots.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! you will not go barefoot? What opulence!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That will be enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know a watchmaker who will buy your watch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is good.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No; it is not good. What will you do after that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever is necessary. Anything honest, that is to say.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know English?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know German?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So much the worse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because one of my friends, a publisher, is getting up a sort of anencyclopædia, for which you might have translated English or Germanarticles. It is badly paid work, but one can live by it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will learn English and German.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And in the meanwhile?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile I will live on my clothes and my watch.&rdquo;</p><p>The clothes-dealer was sent for. He paid twenty francs for the cast-offgarments. They went to the watchmaker&rsquo;s. He bought the watch forforty-five francs.</p><p>&ldquo;That is not bad,&rdquo; said Marius to Courfeyrac, on their return to thehotel, &ldquo;with my fifteen francs, that makes eighty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the hotel bill?&rdquo; observed Courfeyrac.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello, I had forgotten that,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>The landlord presented his bill, which had to be paid on the spot. Itamounted to seventy francs.</p><p>&ldquo;I have ten francs left,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;The deuce,&rdquo; exclaimed Courfeyrac, &ldquo;you will eat up five francs while youare learning English, and five while learning German. That will beswallowing a tongue very fast, or a hundred sous very slowly.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime Aunt Gillenormand, a rather good-hearted person at bottomin difficulties, had finally hunted up Marius&rsquo; abode.</p><p>One morning, on his return from the law-school, Marius found a letter fromhis aunt, and the <i>sixty pistoles</i>, that is to say, six hundredfrancs in gold, in a sealed box.</p><p>Marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt, with a respectful letter,in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that heshould be able thenceforth to supply all his needs. At that moment, he hadthree francs left.</p><p>His aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear ofexasperating him. Besides, had he not said: &ldquo;Let me never hear the name ofthat blood-drinker again!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius left the hotel de la Porte Saint-Jacques, as he did not wish to runin debt there.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0208" id="link2H_4_0208"></a>BOOK FIFTH&mdash;THE EXCELLENCE OF MISFORTUNE</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0182" id="link2HCH0182"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;MARIUS INDIGENT</h3><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0025" id="linkimage-0025"></a><img src="images/3b5-1-misfortune.jpg" alt="Excellence of Misfortune" width="100%" /></div><p>Life became hard for Marius. It was nothing to eat his clothes and hiswatch. He ate of that terrible, inexpressible thing that is called <i>dela vache enragé</i>; that is to say, he endured great hardships andprivations. A terrible thing it is, containing days without bread, nightswithout sleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without a fire, weekswithout work, a future without hope, a coat out at the elbows, an old hatwhich evokes the laughter of young girls, a door which one finds locked onone at night because one&rsquo;s rent is not paid, the insolence of the porterand the cook-shop man, the sneers of neighbors, humiliations, dignitytrampled on, work of whatever nature accepted, disgusts, bitterness,despondency. Marius learned how all this is eaten, and how such are oftenthe only things which one has to devour. At that moment of his existencewhen a man needs his pride, because he needs love, he felt that he wasjeered at because he was badly dressed, and ridiculous because he waspoor. At the age when youth swells the heart with imperial pride, hedropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots, and he knew theunjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness. Admirable andterrible trial from which the feeble emerge base, from which the strongemerge sublime. A crucible into which destiny casts a man, whenever itdesires a scoundrel or a demi-god.</p><p>For many great deeds are performed in petty combats. There are instancesof bravery ignored and obstinate, which defend themselves step by step inthat fatal onslaught of necessities and turpitudes. Noble and mysterioustriumphs which no eye beholds, which are requited with no renown, whichare saluted with no trumpet blast. Life, misfortune, isolation,abandonment, poverty, are the fields of battle which have their heroes;obscure heroes, who are, sometimes, grander than the heroes who winrenown.</p><p>Firm and rare natures are thus created; misery, almost always astep-mother, is sometimes a mother; destitution gives birth to might ofsoul and spirit; distress is the nurse of pride; unhappiness is a goodmilk for the magnanimous.</p><p>There came a moment in Marius&rsquo; life, when he swept his own landing, whenhe bought his sou&rsquo;s worth of Brie cheese at the fruiterer&rsquo;s, when hewaited until twilight had fallen to slip into the baker&rsquo;s and purchase aloaf, which he carried off furtively to his attic as though he had stolenit. Sometimes there could be seen gliding into the butcher&rsquo;s shop on thecorner, in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him, an awkwardyoung man, carrying big books under his arm, who had a timid yet angryair, who, on entering, removed his hat from a brow whereon stood drops ofperspiration, made a profound bow to the butcher&rsquo;s astonished wife, askedfor a mutton cutlet, paid six or seven sous for it, wrapped it up in apaper, put it under his arm, between two books, and went away. It wasMarius. On this cutlet, which he cooked for himself, he lived for threedays.</p><p>On the first day he ate the meat, on the second he ate the fat, on thethird he gnawed the bone. Aunt Gillenormand made repeated attempts, andsent him the sixty pistoles several times. Marius returned them on everyoccasion, saying that he needed nothing.</p><p>He was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which we havejust described was effected within him. From that time forth, he had notput off his black garments. But his garments were quitting him. The daycame when he had no longer a coat. The trousers would go next. What was tobe done? Courfeyrac, to whom he had, on his side, done some good turns,gave him an old coat. For thirty sous, Marius got it turned by some porteror other, and it was a new coat. But this coat was green. Then Mariusceased to go out until after nightfall. This made his coat black. As hewished always to appear in mourning, he clothed himself with the night.</p><p>In spite of all this, he got admitted to practice as a lawyer. He wassupposed to live in Courfeyrac&rsquo;s room, which was decent, and where acertain number of law-books backed up and completed by several dilapidatedvolumes of romance, passed as the library required by the regulations. Hehad his letters addressed to Courfeyrac&rsquo;s quarters.</p><p>When Marius became a lawyer, he informed his grandfather of the fact in aletter which was cold but full of submission and respect. M. Gillenormandtrembled as he took the letter, read it, tore it in four pieces, and threwit into the waste-basket. Two or three days later, MademoiselleGillenormand heard her father, who was alone in his room, talking aloud tohimself. He always did this whenever he was greatly agitated. Shelistened, and the old man was saying: &ldquo;If you were not a fool, you wouldknow that one cannot be a baron and a lawyer at the same time.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0183" id="link2HCH0183"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;MARIUS POOR</h3><p>It is the same with wretchedness as with everything else. It ends bybecoming bearable. It finally assumes a form, and adjusts itself. Onevegetates, that is to say, one develops in a certain meagre fashion, whichis, however, sufficient for life. This is the mode in which the existenceof Marius Pontmercy was arranged:</p><p>He had passed the worst straits; the narrow pass was opening out a littlein front of him. By dint of toil, perseverance, courage, and will, he hadmanaged to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year. He hadlearned German and English; thanks to Courfeyrac, who had put him incommunication with his friend the publisher, Marius filled the modest postof utility man in the literature of the publishing house. He drew upprospectuses, translated newspapers, annotated editions, compiledbiographies, etc.; net product, year in and year out, seven hundredfrancs. He lived on it. How? Not so badly. We will explain.</p><p>Marius occupied in the Gorbeau house, for an annual sum of thirty francs,a den minus a fireplace, called a cabinet, which contained only the mostindispensable articles of furniture. This furniture belonged to him. Hegave three francs a month to the old <i>principal tenant</i> to come andsweep his hole, and to bring him a little hot water every morning, a freshegg, and a penny roll. He breakfasted on this egg and roll. His breakfastvaried in cost from two to four sous, according as eggs were dear orcheap. At six o&rsquo;clock in the evening he descended the Rue Saint-Jacques todine at Rousseau&rsquo;s, opposite Basset&rsquo;s, the stamp-dealer&rsquo;s, on the cornerof the Rue des Mathurins. He ate no soup. He took a six-sou plate of meat,a half-portion of vegetables for three sous, and a three-sou dessert. Forthree sous he got as much bread as he wished. As for wine, he drank water.When he paid at the desk where Madam Rousseau, at that period still plumpand rosy majestically presided, he gave a sou to the waiter, and MadamRousseau gave him a smile. Then he went away. For sixteen sous he had asmile and a dinner.</p><p>This Restaurant Rousseau, where so few bottles and so many water carafeswere emptied, was a calming potion rather than a restaurant. It no longerexists. The proprietor had a fine nickname: he was called <i>Rousseau theAquatic</i>.</p><p>Thus, breakfast four sous, dinner sixteen sous; his food cost him twentysous a day; which made three hundred and sixty-five francs a year. Add thethirty francs for rent, and the thirty-six francs to the old woman, plus afew trifling expenses; for four hundred and fifty francs, Marius was fed,lodged, and waited on. His clothing cost him a hundred francs, his linenfifty francs, his washing fifty francs; the whole did not exceed sixhundred and fifty francs. He was rich. He sometimes lent ten francs to afriend. Courfeyrac had once been able to borrow sixty francs of him. Asfar as fire was concerned, as Marius had no fireplace, he had &ldquo;simplifiedmatters.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius always had two complete suits of clothes, the one old, &ldquo;for everyday&rdquo;; the other, brand new for special occasions. Both were black. He hadbut three shirts, one on his person, the second in the commode, and thethird in the washerwoman&rsquo;s hands. He renewed them as they wore out. Theywere always ragged, which caused him to button his coat to the chin.</p><p>It had required years for Marius to attain to this flourishing condition.Hard years; difficult, some of them, to traverse, others to climb. Mariushad not failed for a single day. He had endured everything in the way ofdestitution; he had done everything except contract debts. He did himselfthe justice to say that he had never owed any one a sou. A debt was, tohim, the beginning of slavery. He even said to himself, that a creditor isworse than a master; for the master possesses only your person, a creditorpossesses your dignity and can administer to it a box on the ear. Ratherthan borrow, he went without food. He had passed many a day fasting.Feeling that all extremes meet, and that, if one is not on one&rsquo;s guard,lowered fortunes may lead to baseness of soul, he kept a jealous watch onhis pride. Such and such a formality or action, which, in any othersituation would have appeared merely a deference to him, now seemedinsipidity, and he nerved himself against it. His face wore a sort ofsevere flush. He was timid even to rudeness.</p><p>During all these trials he had felt himself encouraged and even uplifted,at times, by a secret force that he possessed within himself. The soulaids the body, and at certain moments, raises it. It is the only birdwhich bears up its own cage.</p><p>Besides his father&rsquo;s name, another name was graven in Marius&rsquo; heart, thename of Thénardier. Marius, with his grave and enthusiastic nature,surrounded with a sort of aureole the man to whom, in his thoughts, he owedhis father&rsquo;s life,&mdash;that intrepid sergeant who had saved the colonelamid the bullets and the cannon-balls of Waterloo. He never separated thememory of this man from the memory of his father, and he associated themin his veneration. It was a sort of worship in two steps, with the grandaltar for the colonel and the lesser one for Thénardier. What redoubledthe tenderness of his gratitude towards Thénardier, was the idea of thedistress into which he knew that Thénardier had fallen, and which hadengulfed the latter. Marius had learned at Montfermeil of the ruin andbankruptcy of the unfortunate inn-keeper. Since that time, he had madeunheard-of efforts to find traces of him and to reach him in that darkabyss of misery in which Thénardier had disappeared. Marius had beaten thewhole country; he had gone to Chelles, to Bondy, to Gourney, to Nogent, toLagny. He had persisted for three years, expending in these explorationsthe little money which he had laid by. No one had been able to give himany news of Thénardier: he was supposed to have gone abroad. His creditorshad also sought him, with less love than Marius, but with as muchassiduity, and had not been able to lay their hands on him. Marius blamedhimself, and was almost angry with himself for his lack of success in hisresearches. It was the only debt left him by the colonel, and Marius madeit a matter of honor to pay it. &ldquo;What,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;when my father laydying on the field of battle, did Thénardier contrive to find him amid thesmoke and the grape-shot, and bear him off on his shoulders, and yet heowed him nothing, and I, who owe so much to Thénardier, cannot join him inthis shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death, and in my turn bringhim back from death to life! Oh! I will find him!&rdquo; To find Thénardier, infact, Marius would have given one of his arms, to rescue him from hismisery, he would have sacrificed all his blood. To see Thénardier, torender Thénardier some service, to say to him: &ldquo;You do not know me; well,I do know you! Here I am. Dispose of me!&rdquo; This was Marius&rsquo; sweetest andmost magnificent dream.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0184" id="link2HCH0184"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;MARIUS GROWN UP</h3><p>At this epoch, Marius was twenty years of age. It was three years since hehad left his grandfather. Both parties had remained on the same terms,without attempting to approach each other, and without seeking to see eachother. Besides, what was the use of seeing each other? Marius was thebrass vase, while Father Gillenormand was the iron pot.</p><p>We admit that Marius was mistaken as to his grandfather&rsquo;s heart. He hadimagined that M. Gillenormand had never loved him, and that that crusty,harsh, and smiling old fellow who cursed, shouted, and stormed andbrandished his cane, cherished for him, at the most, only that affection,which is at once slight and severe, of the dotards of comedy. Marius wasin error. There are fathers who do not love their children; there existsno grandfather who does not adore his grandson. At bottom, as we havesaid, M. Gillenormand idolized Marius. He idolized him after his ownfashion, with an accompaniment of snappishness and boxes on the ear; but,this child once gone, he felt a black void in his heart; he would allow noone to mention the child to him, and all the while secretly regretted thathe was so well obeyed. At first, he hoped that this Buonapartist, thisJacobin, this terrorist, this Septembrist, would return. But the weekspassed by, years passed; to M. Gillenormand&rsquo;s great despair, the&ldquo;blood-drinker&rdquo; did not make his appearance. &ldquo;I could not do otherwisethan turn him out,&rdquo; said the grandfather to himself, and he asked himself:&ldquo;If the thing were to do over again, would I do it?&rdquo; His pride instantlyanswered &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; but his aged head, which he shook in silence, repliedsadly &ldquo;no.&rdquo; He had his hours of depression. He missed Marius. Old men needaffection as they need the sun. It is warmth. Strong as his nature was,the absence of Marius had wrought some change in him. Nothing in the worldcould have induced him to take a step towards &ldquo;that rogue&rdquo;; but hesuffered. He never inquired about him, but he thought of him incessantly.He lived in the Marais in a more and more retired manner; he was stillmerry and violent as of old, but his merriment had a convulsive harshness,and his violences always terminated in a sort of gentle and gloomydejection. He sometimes said: &ldquo;Oh! if he only would return, what a goodbox on the ear I would give him!&rdquo;</p><p>As for his aunt, she thought too little to love much; Marius was no longerfor her much more than a vague black form; and she eventually came tooccupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the paroquet whichshe probably had. What augmented Father Gillenormand&rsquo;s secret sufferingwas, that he locked it all up within his breast, and did not allow itsexistence to be divined. His sorrow was like those recently inventedfurnaces which consume their own smoke. It sometimes happened thatofficious busybodies spoke to him of Marius, and asked him: &ldquo;What is yourgrandson doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;What has become of him?&rdquo; The old bourgeois replied witha sigh, that he was a sad case, and giving a fillip to his cuff, if hewished to appear gay: &ldquo;Monsieur le Baron de Pontmercy is practisingpettifogging in some corner or other.&rdquo;</p><p>While the old man regretted, Marius applauded himself. As is the case withall good-hearted people, misfortune had eradicated his bitterness. He onlythought of M. Gillenormand in an amiable light, but he had set his mind onnot receiving anything more from the man who <i>had been unkind to hisfather</i>. This was the mitigated translation of his first indignation.Moreover, he was happy at having suffered, and at suffering still. It wasfor his father&rsquo;s sake. The hardness of his life satisfied and pleased him.He said to himself with a sort of joy that&mdash; <i>it was certainly theleast he could do</i>; that it was an expiation;&mdash;that, had it notbeen for that, he would have been punished in some other way and later onfor his impious indifference towards his father, and such a father! thatit would not have been just that his father should have all the suffering,and he none of it; and that, in any case, what were his toils and hisdestitution compared with the colonel&rsquo;s heroic life? that, in short, theonly way for him to approach his father and resemble him, was to be bravein the face of indigence, as the other had been valiant before the enemy;and that that was, no doubt, what the colonel had meant to imply by thewords: &ldquo;He will be worthy of it.&rdquo; Words which Marius continued to wear,not on his breast, since the colonel&rsquo;s writing had disappeared, but in hisheart.</p><p>And then, on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors, hehad been only a child, now he was a man. He felt it. Misery, we repeat,had been good for him. Poverty in youth, when it succeeds, has thismagnificent property about it, that it turns the whole will towardseffort, and the whole soul towards aspiration. Poverty instantly laysmaterial life bare and renders it hideous; hence inexpressible boundstowards the ideal life. The wealthy young man has a hundred coarse andbrilliant distractions, horse races, hunting, dogs, tobacco, gaming, goodrepasts, and all the rest of it; occupations for the baser side of thesoul, at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides. The pooryoung man wins his bread with difficulty; he eats; when he has eaten, hehas nothing more but meditation. He goes to the spectacles which Godfurnishes gratis; he gazes at the sky, space, the stars, flowers,children, the humanity among which he is suffering, the creation amidwhich he beams. He gazes so much on humanity that he perceives its soul,he gazes upon creation to such an extent that he beholds God. He dreams,he feels himself great; he dreams on, and feels himself tender. From theegotism of the man who suffers he passes to the compassion of the man whomeditates. An admirable sentiment breaks forth in him, forgetfulness ofself and pity for all. As he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments whichnature offers, gives, and lavishes to souls which stand open, and refusesto souls that are closed, he comes to pity, he the millionnaire of themind, the millionnaire of money. All hatred departs from his heart, inproportion as light penetrates his spirit. And is he unhappy? No. Themisery of a young man is never miserable. The first young lad who comes tohand, however poor he may be, with his strength, his health, his rapidwalk, his brilliant eyes, his warmly circulating blood, his black hair,his red lips, his white teeth, his pure breath, will always arouse theenvy of an aged emperor. And then, every morning, he sets himself afreshto the task of earning his bread; and while his hands earn his bread, hisdorsal column gains pride, his brain gathers ideas. His task finished, hereturns to ineffable ecstasies, to contemplation, to joys; he beholds hisfeet set in afflictions, in obstacles, on the pavement, in the nettles,sometimes in the mire; his head in the light. He is firm, serene, gentle,peaceful, attentive, serious, content with little, kindly; and he thanksGod for having bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a richman lacks: work, which makes him free; and thought, which makes himdignified.</p><p>This is what had happened with Marius. To tell the truth, he inclined alittle too much to the side of contemplation. From the day when he hadsucceeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty, he hadstopped, thinking it good to be poor, and retrenching time from his workto give to thought; that is to say, he sometimes passed entire days inmeditation, absorbed, engulfed, like a visionary, in the mutevoluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance. He had thus propounded theproblem of his life: to toil as little as possible at material labor, inorder to toil as much as possible at the labor which is impalpable; inother words, to bestow a few hours on real life, and to cast the rest tothe infinite. As he believed that he lacked nothing, he did not perceivethat contemplation, thus understood, ends by becoming one of the forms ofidleness; that he was contenting himself with conquering the firstnecessities of life, and that he was resting from his labors too soon.</p><p>It was evident that, for this energetic and enthusiastic nature, thiscould only be a transitory state, and that, at the first shock against theinevitable complications of destiny, Marius would awaken.</p><p>In the meantime, although he was a lawyer, and whatever FatherGillenormand thought about the matter, he was not practising, he was noteven pettifogging. Meditation had turned him aside from pleading. To hauntattorneys, to follow the court, to hunt up cases&mdash;what a bore! Whyshould he do it? He saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining hislivelihood! The obscure and ill-paid publishing establishment had come tomean for him a sure source of work which did not involve too much labor,as we have explained, and which sufficed for his wants.</p><p>One of the publishers for whom he worked, M. Magimel, I think, offered totake him into his own house, to lodge him well, to furnish him withregular occupation, and to give him fifteen hundred francs a year. To bewell lodged! Fifteen hundred francs! No doubt. But renounce his liberty!Be on fixed wages! A sort of hired man of letters! According to Marius&rsquo;opinion, if he accepted, his position would become both better and worseat the same time, he acquired comfort, and lost his dignity; it was a fineand complete unhappiness converted into a repulsive and ridiculous stateof torture: something like the case of a blind man who should recover thesight of one eye. He refused.</p><p>Marius dwelt in solitude. Owing to his taste for remaining outside ofeverything, and through having been too much alarmed, he had not entereddecidedly into the group presided over by Enjolras. They had remained goodfriends; they were ready to assist each other on occasion in everypossible way; but nothing more. Marius had two friends: one young,Courfeyrac; and one old, M. Mabeuf. He inclined more to the old man. Inthe first place, he owed to him the revolution which had taken placewithin him; to him he was indebted for having known and loved his father.&ldquo;He operated on me for a cataract,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>The churchwarden had certainly played a decisive part.</p><p>It was not, however, that M. Mabeuf had been anything but the calm andimpassive agent of Providence in this connection. He had enlightenedMarius by chance and without being aware of the fact, as does a candlewhich some one brings; he had been the candle and not the some one.</p><p>As for Marius&rsquo; inward political revolution, M. Mabeuf was totallyincapable of comprehending it, of willing or of directing it.</p><p>As we shall see M. Mabeuf again, later on, a few words will not besuperfluous.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0185" id="link2HCH0185"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;M. MABEUF</h3><p>On the day when M. Mabeuf said to Marius: &ldquo;Certainly I approve ofpolitical opinions,&rdquo; he expressed the real state of his mind. Allpolitical opinions were matters of indifference to him, and he approvedthem all, without distinction, provided they left him in peace, as theGreeks called the Furies &ldquo;the beautiful, the good, the charming,&rdquo; theEumenides. M. Mabeuf&rsquo;s political opinion consisted in a passionate lovefor plants, and, above all, for books. Like all the rest of the world, hepossessed the termination in <i>ist</i>, without which no one could existat that time, but he was neither a Royalist, a Bonapartist, a Chartist, anOrleanist, nor an Anarchist; he was a <i>bouquinist</i>, a collector ofold books. He did not understand how men could busy themselves with hatingeach other because of silly stuff like the charter, democracy, legitimacy,monarchy, the republic, etc., when there were in the world all sorts ofmosses, grasses, and shrubs which they might be looking at, and heaps offolios, and even of 32mos, which they might turn over. He took good carenot to become useless; having books did not prevent his reading, being abotanist did not prevent his being a gardener. When he made Pontmercy&rsquo;sacquaintance, this sympathy had existed between the colonel and himself&mdash;thatwhat the colonel did for flowers, he did for fruits. M. Mabeuf hadsucceeded in producing seedling pears as savory as the pears of St.Germain; it is from one of his combinations, apparently, that the OctoberMirabelle, now celebrated and no less perfumed than the summer Mirabelle,owes its origin. He went to mass rather from gentleness than from piety,and because, as he loved the faces of men, but hated their noise, he foundthem assembled and silent only in church. Feeling that he must besomething in the State, he had chosen the career of warden. However, hehad never succeeded in loving any woman as much as a tulip bulb, nor anyman as much as an Elzevir. He had long passed sixty, when, one day, someone asked him: &ldquo;Have you never been married?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have forgotten,&rdquo; said he.When it sometimes happened to him&mdash;and to whom does it not happen?&mdash;tosay: &ldquo;Oh! if I were only rich!&rdquo; it was not when ogling a pretty girl, aswas the case with Father Gillenormand, but when contemplating an old book.He lived alone with an old housekeeper. He was somewhat gouty, and when hewas asleep, his aged fingers, stiffened with rheumatism, lay crooked up inthe folds of his sheets. He had composed and published a <i>Flora of theEnvirons of Cauteretz</i>, with colored plates, a work which enjoyed atolerable measure of esteem and which sold well. People rang his bell, inthe Rue Mésières, two or three times a day, to ask for it. He drew as muchas two thousand francs a year from it; this constituted nearly the wholeof his fortune. Although poor, he had had the talent to form for himself,by dint of patience, privations, and time, a precious collection of rarecopies of every sort. He never went out without a book under his arm, andhe often returned with two. The sole decoration of the four rooms on theground floor, which composed his lodgings, consisted of framed herbariums,and engravings of the old masters. The sight of a sword or a gun chilledhis blood. He had never approached a cannon in his life, even at theInvalides. He had a passable stomach, a brother who was a curé, perfectlywhite hair, no teeth, either in his mouth or his mind, a trembling inevery limb, a Picard accent, an infantile laugh, the air of an old sheep,and he was easily frightened. Add to this, that he had no otherfriendship, no other acquaintance among the living, than an old booksellerof the Porte-Saint-Jacques, named Royal. His dream was to naturalizeindigo in France.</p><p>His servant was also a sort of innocent. The poor good old woman was aspinster. Sultan, her cat, which might have mewed Allegri&rsquo;s miserere inthe Sixtine Chapel, had filled her heart and sufficed for the quantity ofpassion which existed in her. None of her dreams had ever proceeded as faras man. She had never been able to get further than her cat. Like him, shehad a moustache. Her glory consisted in her caps, which were always white.She passed her time, on Sundays, after mass, in counting over the linen inher chest, and in spreading out on her bed the dresses in the piece whichshe bought and never had made up. She knew how to read. M. Mabeuf hadnicknamed her Mother Plutarque.</p><p>M. Mabeuf had taken a fancy to Marius, because Marius, being young andgentle, warmed his age without startling his timidity. Youth combined withgentleness produces on old people the effect of the sun without wind. WhenMarius was saturated with military glory, with gunpowder, with marches andcountermarches, and with all those prodigious battles in which his fatherhad given and received such tremendous blows of the sword, he went to seeM. Mabeuf, and M. Mabeuf talked to him of his hero from the point of viewof flowers.</p><p>His brother the curé died about 1830, and almost immediately, as when thenight is drawing on, the whole horizon grew dark for M. Mabeuf. A notary&rsquo;sfailure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs, which was all thathe possessed in his brother&rsquo;s right and his own. The Revolution of Julybrought a crisis to publishing. In a period of embarrassment, the firstthing which does not sell is a <i>Flora. The Flora of the Environs ofCauteretz</i> stopped short. Weeks passed by without a single purchaser.Sometimes M. Mabeuf started at the sound of the bell. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; saidMother Plutarque sadly, &ldquo;it is the water-carrier.&rdquo; In short, one day, M.Mabeuf quitted the Rue Mésières, abdicated the functions of warden, gaveup Saint-Sulpice, sold not a part of his books, but of his prints,&mdash;thatto which he was the least attached,&mdash;and installed himself in alittle house on the Rue Montparnasse, where, however, he remained but onequarter for two reasons: in the first place, the ground floor and thegarden cost three hundred francs, and he dared not spend more than twohundred francs on his rent; in the second, being near Faton&rsquo;sshooting-gallery, he could hear the pistol-shots; which was intolerable tohim.</p><p>He carried off his <i>Flora</i>, his copper-plates, his herbariums, hisportfolios, and his books, and established himself near the Salpêtrière,in a sort of thatched cottage of the village of Austerlitz, where, forfifty crowns a year, he got three rooms and a garden enclosed by a hedge,and containing a well. He took advantage of this removal to sell offnearly all his furniture. On the day of his entrance into his newquarters, he was very gay, and drove the nails on which his engravings andherbariums were to hang, with his own hands, dug in his garden the rest ofthe day, and at night, perceiving that Mother Plutarque had a melancholyair, and was very thoughtful, he tapped her on the shoulder and said toher with a smile: &ldquo;We have the indigo!&rdquo;</p><p>Only two visitors, the bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques and Marius,were admitted to view the thatched cottage at Austerlitz, a brawling namewhich was, to tell the truth, extremely disagreeable to him.</p><p>However, as we have just pointed out, brains which are absorbed in somebit of wisdom, or folly, or, as it often happens, in both at once, are butslowly accessible to the things of actual life. Their own destiny is afar-off thing to them. There results from such concentration a passivity,which, if it were the outcome of reasoning, would resemble philosophy. Onedeclines, descends, trickles away, even crumbles away, and yet is hardlyconscious of it one&rsquo;s self. It always ends, it is true, in an awakening,but the awakening is tardy. In the meantime, it seems as though we heldourselves neutral in the game which is going on between our happiness andour unhappiness. We are the stake, and we look on at the game withindifference.</p><p>It is thus that, athwart the cloud which formed about him, when all hishopes were extinguished one after the other, M. Mabeuf remained ratherpuerilely, but profoundly serene. His habits of mind had the regular swingof a pendulum. Once mounted on an illusion, he went for a very long time,even after the illusion had disappeared. A clock does not stop short atthe precise moment when the key is lost.</p><p>M. Mabeuf had his innocent pleasures. These pleasures were inexpensive andunexpected; the merest chance furnished them. One day, Mother Plutarquewas reading a romance in one corner of the room. She was reading aloud,finding that she understood better thus. To read aloud is to assure one&rsquo;sself of what one is reading. There are people who read very loud, and whohave the appearance of giving themselves their word of honor as to whatthey are perusing.</p><p>It was with this sort of energy that Mother Plutarque was reading theromance which she had in hand. M. Mabeuf heard her without listening toher.</p><p>In the course of her reading, Mother Plutarque came to this phrase. It wasa question of an officer of dragoons and a beauty:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;The beauty pouted, and the dragoon&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Here she interrupted herself to wipe her glasses.</p><p>&ldquo;Bouddha and the Dragon,&rdquo; struck in M. Mabeuf in a low voice. &ldquo;Yes, it istrue that there was a dragon, which, from the depths of its cave, spoutedflame through his maw and set the heavens on fire. Many stars had alreadybeen consumed by this monster, which, besides, had the claws of a tiger.Bouddha went into its den and succeeded in converting the dragon. That isa good book that you are reading, Mother Plutarque. There is no morebeautiful legend in existence.&rdquo;</p><p>And M. Mabeuf fell into a delicious reverie.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0186" id="link2HCH0186"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;POVERTY A GOOD NEIGHBOR FOR MISERY</h3><p>Marius liked this candid old man who saw himself gradually falling intothe clutches of indigence, and who came to feel astonishment, little bylittle, without, however, being made melancholy by it. Marius metCourfeyrac and sought out M. Mabeuf. Very rarely, however; twice a monthat most.</p><p>Marius&rsquo; pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outerboulevards, or in the Champs-de-Mars, or in the least frequented alleys ofthe Luxembourg. He often spent half a day in gazing at a market garden,the beds of lettuce, the chickens on the dung-heap, the horse turning thewater-wheel. The passers-by stared at him in surprise, and some of themthought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister. He was only a pooryoung man dreaming in an objectless way.</p><p>It was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the Gorbeau house,and, tempted by its isolation and its cheapness, had taken up his abodethere. He was known there only under the name of M. Marius.</p><p>Some of his father&rsquo;s old generals or old comrades had invited him to goand see them, when they learned about him. Marius had not refused theirinvitations. They afforded opportunities of talking about his father. Thushe went from time to time, to Comte Pajol, to General Bellavesne, toGeneral Fririon, to the Invalides. There was music and dancing there. Onsuch evenings, Marius put on his new coat. But he never went to theseevening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing cold, becausehe could not afford a carriage, and he did not wish to arrive with bootsotherwise than like mirrors.</p><p>He said sometimes, but without bitterness: &ldquo;Men are so made that in adrawing-room you may be soiled everywhere except on your shoes. In orderto insure a good reception there, only one irreproachable thing is askedof you; your conscience? No, your boots.&rdquo;</p><p>All passions except those of the heart are dissipated by reverie. Marius&rsquo;political fevers vanished thus. The Revolution of 1830 assisted in theprocess, by satisfying and calming him. He remained the same, settingaside his fits of wrath. He still held the same opinions. Only, they hadbeen tempered. To speak accurately, he had no longer any opinions, he hadsympathies. To what party did he belong? To the party of humanity. Out ofhumanity he chose France; out of the Nation he chose the people; out ofthe people he chose the woman. It was to that point above all, that hispity was directed. Now he preferred an idea to a deed, a poet to a hero,and he admired a book like Job more than an event like Marengo. And then,when, after a day spent in meditation, he returned in the evening throughthe boulevards, and caught a glimpse through the branches of the trees ofthe fathomless space beyond, the nameless gleams, the abyss, the shadow,the mystery, all that which is only human seemed very pretty indeed tohim.</p><p>He thought that he had, and he really had, in fact, arrived at the truthof life and of human philosophy, and he had ended by gazing at nothing butheaven, the only thing which Truth can perceive from the bottom of herwell.</p><p>This did not prevent him from multiplying his plans, his combinations, hisscaffoldings, his projects for the future. In this state of reverie, an eyewhich could have cast a glance into Marius&rsquo; interior would have beendazzled with the purity of that soul. In fact, had it been given to oureyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of others, we should beable to judge a man much more surely according to what he dreams, thanaccording to what he thinks. There is will in thought, there is none indreams. Reverie, which is utterly spontaneous, takes and keeps, even in thegigantic and the ideal, the form of our spirit. Nothing proceeds moredirectly and more sincerely from the very depth of our soul, than ourunpremeditated and boundless aspirations towards the splendors of destiny.In these aspirations, much more than in deliberate, rational co-ordinatedideas, is the real character of a man to be found. Our chimæras are thethings which the most resemble us. Each one of us dreams of the unknownand the impossible in accordance with his nature.</p><p>Towards the middle of this year 1831, the old woman who waited on Mariustold him that his neighbors, the wretched Jondrette family, had beenturned out of doors. Marius, who passed nearly the whole of his days outof the house, hardly knew that he had any neighbors.</p><p>&ldquo;Why are they turned out?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Because they do not pay their rent; they owe for two quarters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How much is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Twenty francs,&rdquo; said the old woman.</p><p>Marius had thirty francs saved up in a drawer.</p><p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said to the old woman, &ldquo;take these twenty-five francs.

This inspired Aunt Gillenormand with asecond idea. She had, on the first occasion, hit upon the plan of havingMarius spied upon by Théodule; now she plotted to have Théodule takeMarius&rsquo; place.</p><p>At all events and in case the grandfather should feel the vague need of ayoung face in the house,&mdash;these rays of dawn are sometimes sweet toruin,&mdash;it was expedient to find another Marius. &ldquo;Take it as a simpleerratum,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;such as one sees in books. For Marius, readThéodule.&rdquo;</p><p>A grandnephew is almost the same as a grandson; in default of a lawyer onetakes a lancer.</p><p>One morning, when M. Gillenormand was about to read something in the <i>Quotidienne</i>,his daughter entered and said to him in her sweetest voice; for thequestion concerned her favorite:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father, Théodule is coming to present his respects to you this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Théodule?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your grandnephew.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the grandfather.</p><p>Then he went back to his reading, thought no more of his grandnephew, whowas merely some Théodule or other, and soon flew into a rage, which almostalways happened when he read. The &ldquo;sheet&rdquo; which he held, althoughRoyalist, of course, announced for the following day, without anysoftening phrases, one of these little events which were of dailyoccurrence at that date in Paris: &ldquo;That the students of the schools of lawand medicine were to assemble on the Place du Panthéon, at midday,&mdash;todeliberate.&rdquo; The discussion concerned one of the questions of the moment,the artillery of the National Guard, and a conflict between the Ministerof War and &ldquo;the citizen&rsquo;s militia,&rdquo; on the subject of the cannon parked inthe courtyard of the Louvre. The students were to &ldquo;deliberate&rdquo; over this.It did not take much more than this to swell M. Gillenormand&rsquo;s rage.</p><p>He thought of Marius, who was a student, and who would probably go withthe rest, to &ldquo;deliberate, at midday, on the Place du Panthéon.&rdquo;</p><p>As he was indulging in this painful dream, Lieutenant Théodule enteredclad in plain clothes as a bourgeois, which was clever of him, and wasdiscreetly introduced by Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The lancer hadreasoned as follows: &ldquo;The old druid has not sunk all his money in a lifepension. It is well to disguise one&rsquo;s self as a civilian from time totime.&rdquo;</p><p>Mademoiselle Gillenormand said aloud to her father:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Théodule, your grandnephew.&rdquo;</p><p>And in a low voice to the lieutenant:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Approve of everything.&rdquo;</p><p>And she withdrew.</p><p>The lieutenant, who was but little accustomed to such venerableencounters, stammered with some timidity: &ldquo;Good day, uncle,&rdquo;&mdash;andmade a salute composed of the involuntary and mechanical outline of themilitary salute finished off as a bourgeois salute.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! so it&rsquo;s you; that is well, sit down,&rdquo; said the old gentleman.</p><p>That said, he totally forgot the lancer.</p><p>Théodule seated himself, and M. Gillenormand rose.</p><p>M. Gillenormand began to pace back and forth, his hands in his pockets,talking aloud, and twitching, with his irritated old fingers, at the twowatches which he wore in his two fobs.</p><p>&ldquo;That pack of brats! they convene on the Place du Panthéon! by my life!urchins who were with their nurses but yesterday! If one were to squeezetheir noses, milk would burst out. And they deliberate to-morrow, atmidday. What are we coming to? What are we coming to? It is clear that weare making for the abyss. That is what the <i>descamisados</i> havebrought us to! To deliberate on the citizen artillery! To go and jabber inthe open air over the jibes of the National Guard! And with whom are theyto meet there? Just see whither Jacobinism leads. I will bet anything youlike, a million against a counter, that there will be no one there butreturned convicts and released galley-slaves. The Republicans and thegalley-slaves,&mdash;they form but one nose and one handkerchief. Carnotused to say: &lsquo;Where would you have me go, traitor?&rsquo; Fouché replied:‘Wherever you please, imbecile!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what the Republicans are like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Théodule.</p><p>M. Gillenormand half turned his head, saw Théodule, and went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;When one reflects that that scoundrel was so vile as to turn carbonaro!Why did you leave my house? To go and become a Republican! Pssst! In thefirst place, the people want none of your republic, they have commonsense, they know well that there always have been kings, and that therealways will be; they know well that the people are only the people, afterall, they make sport of it, of your republic&mdash;do you understand,idiot? Is it not a horrible caprice?

They are all alike. Not oneescapes. It suffices for them to breathe the air which blows through thestreet to lose their senses. The nineteenth century is poison. The firstscamp that happens along lets his beard grow like a goat&rsquo;s, thinks himselfa real scoundrel, and abandons his old relatives. He&rsquo;s a Republican, he&rsquo;sa romantic. What does that mean, romantic? Do me the favor to tell me whatit is. All possible follies. A year ago, they ran to <i>Hernani</i>. Now,I just ask you, <i>Hernani!</i> antitheses! abominations which are noteven written in French! And then, they have cannons in the courtyard ofthe Louvre. Such are the rascalities of this age!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are right, uncle,&rdquo; said Théodule.</p><p>M. Gillenormand resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Cannons in the courtyard of the Museum! For what purpose? Do you want tofire grape-shot at the Apollo Belvedere? What have those cartridges to dowith the Venus de Medici? Oh! the young men of the present day are allblackguards!

They do all they can to makethemselves ugly, they are badly dressed, they are afraid of women, in thepresence of petticoats they have a mendicant air which sets the girls intofits of laughter; on my word of honor, one would say the poor creatureswere ashamed of love. They are deformed, and they complete themselves bybeing stupid; they repeat the puns of Tiercelin and Potier, they have sackcoats, stablemen&rsquo;s waistcoats, shirts of coarse linen, trousers of coarsecloth, boots of coarse leather, and their rigmarole resembles theirplumage. One might make use of their jargon to put new soles on their oldshoes. And all this awkward batch of brats has political opinions, if youplease. Political opinions should be strictly forbidden. They fabricatesystems, they recast society, they demolish the monarchy, they fling alllaws to the earth, they put the attic in the cellar&rsquo;s place and my porterin the place of the King, they turn Europe topsy-turvy, they reconstructthe world, and all their love affairs consist in staring slily at theankles of the laundresses as these women climb into their carts. Ah!Marius! Ah! you blackguard! to go and vociferate on the public place! todiscuss, to debate, to take measures! They call that measures, just God!Disorder humbles itself and becomes silly. I have seen chaos, I now see amess. Students deliberating on the National Guard,&mdash;such a thingcould not be seen among the Ogibewas nor the Cadodaches!

Those creatures deliberate andratiocinate! The end of the world is come! This is plainly the end of thismiserable terraqueous globe! A final hiccough was required, and France hasemitted it. Deliberate, my rascals! Such things will happen so long asthey go and read the newspapers under the arcades of the Odéon. That coststhem a sou, and their good sense, and their intelligence, and their heartand their soul, and their wits. They emerge thence, and decamp from theirfamilies. All newspapers are pests; all, even the <i>Drapeau Blanc!</i> Atbottom, Martainville was a Jacobin. Ah! just Heaven! you may boast ofhaving driven your grandfather to despair, that you may!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is evident,&rdquo; said Théodule.</p><p>And profiting by the fact that M. Gillenormand was taking breath, thelancer added in a magisterial manner:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There should be no other newspaper than the <i>Moniteur</i>, and no otherbook than the <i>Annuaire Militaire</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Gillenormand continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It is like their Sieyès! A regicide ending in a senator; for that is theway they always end.

I will do myself the justice to say, that I have neverhad any better opinion of the philosophies of all those philosophers, thanof the spectacles of the grimacer of Tivoli! One day I saw the Senatorscross the Quai Malplaquet in mantles of violet velvet sown with bees, withhats à la Henri IV. They were hideous.

His profile, all of whose lines were rounded, without therebylosing their firmness, had a certain Germanic sweetness, which has madeits way into the French physiognomy by way of Alsace and Lorraine, andthat complete absence of angles which rendered the Sicambres so easilyrecognizable among the Romans, and which distinguishes the leonine fromthe aquiline race. He was at that period of life when the mind of men whothink is composed, in nearly equal parts, of depth and ingenuousness. Agrave situation being given, he had all that is required to be stupid: onemore turn of the key, and he might be sublime. His manners were reserved,cold, polished, not very genial. As his mouth was charming, his lips thereddest, and his teeth the whitest in the world, his smile corrected theseverity of his face, as a whole. At certain moments, that pure brow andthat voluptuous smile presented a singular contrast. His eyes were small,but his glance was large.</p><p>At the period of his most abject misery, he had observed that young girlsturned round when he passed by, and he fled or hid, with death in hissoul. He thought that they were staring at him because of his old clothes,and that they were laughing at them; the fact is, that they stared at himbecause of his grace, and that they dreamed of him.</p><p>This mute misunderstanding between him and the pretty passers-by had madehim shy. He chose none of them for the excellent reason that he fled fromall of them. He lived thus indefinitely,&mdash;stupidly, as Courfeyracsaid.</p><p>Courfeyrac also said to him: &ldquo;Do not aspire to be venerable&rdquo; [they calledeach other <i>thou</i>; it is the tendency of youthful friendships to slipinto this mode of address]. &ldquo;Let me give you a piece of advice, my dearfellow. Don&rsquo;t read so many books, and look a little more at the lasses.The jades have some good points about them, O Marius! By dint of fleeingand blushing, you will become brutalized.&rdquo;</p><p>On other occasions, Courfeyrac encountered him and said:&mdash;&ldquo;Goodmorning, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abbé!&rdquo;</p><p>When Courfeyrac had addressed to him some remark of this nature, Mariusavoided women, both young and old, more than ever for a week to come, andhe avoided Courfeyrac to boot.</p><p>Nevertheless, there existed in all the immensity of creation, two womenwhom Marius did not flee, and to whom he paid no attention whatever. Intruth, he would have been very much amazed if he had been informed thatthey were women. One was the bearded old woman who swept out his chamber,and caused Courfeyrac to say: &ldquo;Seeing that his servant woman wears hisbeard, Marius does not wear his own beard.&rdquo; The other was a sort of littlegirl whom he saw very often, and whom he never looked at.</p><p>For more than a year, Marius had noticed in one of the walks of theLuxembourg, the one which skirts the parapet of the Pépinière, a man and avery young girl, who were almost always seated side by side on the samebench, at the most solitary end of the alley, on the Rue de l&rsquo;Ouest side.Every time that that chance which meddles with the strolls of personswhose gaze is turned inwards, led Marius to that walk,&mdash;and it wasnearly every day,&mdash;he found this couple there. The man appeared to beabout sixty years of age; he seemed sad and serious; his whole personpresented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to military men who haveretired from the service. If he had worn a decoration, Marius would havesaid: &ldquo;He is an ex-officer.&rdquo; He had a kindly but unapproachable air, andhe never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one. He wore bluetrousers, a blue frock coat and a broad-brimmed hat, which always appearedto be new, a black cravat, a quaker shirt, that is to say, it wasdazzlingly white, but of coarse linen. A grisette who passed near him oneday, said: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a very tidy widower.&rdquo; His hair was very white.</p><p>The first time that the young girl who accompanied him came and seatedherself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted, she was a sort ofchild thirteen or fourteen years of age, so thin as to be almost homely,awkward, insignificant, and with a possible promise of handsome eyes.Only, they were always raised with a sort of displeasing assurance. Herdress was both aged and childish, like the dress of the scholars in aconvent; it consisted of a badly cut gown of black merino. They had theair of being father and daughter.</p><p>Marius scanned this old man, who was not yet aged, and this little girl,who was not yet a person, for a few days, and thereafter paid no attentionto them. They, on their side, did not appear even to see him. Theyconversed together with a peaceful and indifferent air. The girl chatteredincessantly and merrily. The old man talked but little, and, at times, hefixed on her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity.</p><p>Marius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk. Heinvariably found them there.</p><p>This is the way things went:&mdash;</p><p>Marius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest fromtheir bench; he walked the whole length of the alley, passed in front ofthem, then returned to the extremity whence he had come, and began again.This he did five or six times in the course of his promenade, and thepromenade was taken five or six times a week, without its having occurredto him or to these people to exchange a greeting. That personage, and thatyoung girl, although they appeared,&mdash;and perhaps because theyappeared,&mdash;to shun all glances, had, naturally, caused some attentionon the part of the five or six students who strolled along the Pépinièrefrom time to time; the studious after their lectures, the others aftertheir game of billiards. Courfeyrac, who was among the last, had observedthem several times, but, finding the girl homely, he had speedily andcarefully kept out of the way. He had fled, discharging at them asobriquet, like a Parthian dart. Impressed solely with the child&rsquo;s gownand the old man&rsquo;s hair, he had dubbed the daughter Mademoiselle Lanoire,and the father, Monsieur Leblanc, so that as no one knew them under anyother title, this nickname became a law in the default of any other name.The students said: &ldquo;Ah! Monsieur Leblanc is on his bench.&rdquo; And Marius,like the rest, had found it convenient to call this unknown gentlemanMonsieur Leblanc.</p><p>We shall follow their example, and we shall say M. Leblanc, in order tofacilitate this tale.</p><p>So Marius saw them nearly every day, at the same hour, during the firstyear. He found the man to his taste, but the girl insipid.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0189" id="link2HCH0189"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;LUX FACTA EST</h3><p>During the second year, precisely at the point in this history which thereader has now reached, it chanced that this habit of the Luxembourg wasinterrupted, without Marius himself being quite aware why, and nearly sixmonths elapsed, during which he did not set foot in the alley. One day, atlast, he returned thither once more; it was a serene summer morning, andMarius was in joyous mood, as one is when the weather is fine. It seemedto him that he had in his heart all the songs of the birds that he waslistening to, and all the bits of blue sky of which he caught glimpsesthrough the leaves of the trees.</p><p>He went straight to &ldquo;his alley,&rdquo; and when he reached the end of it heperceived, still on the same bench, that well-known couple. Only, when heapproached, it certainly was the same man; but it seemed to him that itwas no longer the same girl. The person whom he now beheld was a tall andbeautiful creature, possessed of all the most charming lines of a woman atthe precise moment when they are still combined with all the mostingenuous graces of the child; a pure and fugitive moment, which can beexpressed only by these two words,&mdash;&ldquo;fifteen years.&rdquo; She hadwonderful brown hair, shaded with threads of gold, a brow that seemed madeof marble, cheeks that seemed made of rose-leaf, a pale flush, an agitatedwhiteness, an exquisite mouth, whence smiles darted like sunbeams, andwords like music, a head such as Raphael would have given to Mary, setupon a neck that Jean Goujon would have attributed to a Venus. And, inorder that nothing might be lacking to this bewitching face, her nose wasnot handsome&mdash;it was pretty; neither straight nor curved, neitherItalian nor Greek; it was the Parisian nose, that is to say, spiritual,delicate, irregular, pure,&mdash;which drives painters to despair, andcharms poets.</p><p>When Marius passed near her, he could not see her eyes, which wereconstantly lowered. He saw only her long chestnut lashes, permeated withshadow and modesty.</p><p>This did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened towhat the white-haired old man was saying to her, and nothing could be morefascinating than that fresh smile, combined with those drooping eyes.</p><p>For a moment, Marius thought that she was another daughter of the sameman, a sister of the former, no doubt. But when the invariable habit ofhis stroll brought him, for the second time, near the bench, and he hadexamined her attentively, he recognized her as the same. In six months thelittle girl had become a young maiden; that was all. Nothing is morefrequent than this phenomenon. There is a moment when girls blossom out inthe twinkling of an eye, and become roses all at once. One left themchildren but yesterday; today, one finds them disquieting to the feelings.</p><p>This child had not only grown, she had become idealized. As three days inApril suffice to cover certain trees with flowers, six months had sufficedto clothe her with beauty. Her April had arrived.</p><p>One sometimes sees people, who, poor and mean, seem to wake up, passsuddenly from indigence to luxury, indulge in expenditures of all sorts,and become dazzling, prodigal, magnificent, all of a sudden. That is theresult of having pocketed an income; a note fell due yesterday. The younggirl had received her quarterly income.</p><p>And then, she was no longer the school-girl with her felt hat, her merinogown, her scholar&rsquo;s shoes, and red hands; taste had come to her withbeauty; she was a well-dressed person, clad with a sort of rich and simpleelegance, and without affectation. She wore a dress of black damask, acape of the same material, and a bonnet of white crape. Her white glovesdisplayed the delicacy of the hand which toyed with the carved, Chineseivory handle of a parasol, and her silken shoe outlined the smallness ofher foot. When one passed near her, her whole toilette exhaled a youthfuland penetrating perfume.</p><p>As for the man, he was the same as usual.</p><p>The second time that Marius approached her, the young girl raised hereyelids; her eyes were of a deep, celestial blue, but in that veiledazure, there was, as yet, nothing but the glance of a child. She looked atMarius indifferently, as she would have stared at the brat running beneaththe sycamores, or the marble vase which cast a shadow on the bench, andMarius, on his side, continued his promenade, and thought about somethingelse.</p><p>He passed near the bench where the young girl sat, five or six times, butwithout even turning his eyes in her direction.</p><p>On the following days, he returned, as was his wont, to the Luxembourg; asusual, he found there &ldquo;the father and daughter;&rdquo; but he paid no furtherattention to them. He thought no more about the girl now that she wasbeautiful than he had when she was homely. He passed very near the benchwhere she sat, because such was his habit.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0190" id="link2HCH0190"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;EFFECT OF THE SPRING</h3><p>One day, the air was warm, the Luxembourg was inundated with light andshade, the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it thatmorning, the sparrows were giving vent to little twitters in the depths ofthe chestnut-trees. Marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature, hewas not thinking of anything, he simply lived and breathed, he passed nearthe bench, the young girl raised her eyes to him, the two glances met.</p><p>What was there in the young girl&rsquo;s glance on this occasion? Marius couldnot have told. There was nothing and there was everything. It was astrange flash.</p><p>She dropped her eyes, and he pursued his way.</p><p>What he had just seen was no longer the ingenuous and simple eye of achild; it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened, then abruptlyclosed again.</p><p>There comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner. Woe to himwho chances to be there!</p><p>That first gaze of a soul which does not, as yet, know itself, is like thedawn in the sky. It is the awakening of something radiant and strange.Nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of that unexpected gleam,which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from adorable shadows, and whichis composed of all the innocence of the present, and of all the passion ofthe future. It is a sort of undecided tenderness which reveals itself bychance, and which waits. It is a snare which the innocent maiden setsunknown to herself, and in which she captures hearts without eitherwishing or knowing it. It is a virgin looking like a woman.</p><p>It is rare that a profound reverie does not spring from that glance, whereit falls. All purities and all candors meet in that celestial and fatalgleam which, more than all the best-planned tender glances of coquettes,possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming, in the depthsof the soul, of that sombre flower, impregnated with perfume and withpoison, which is called love.</p><p>That evening, on his return to his garret, Marius cast his eyes over hisgarments, and perceived, for the first time, that he had been so slovenly,indecorous, and inconceivably stupid as to go for his walk in theLuxembourg with his &ldquo;every-day clothes,&rdquo; that is to say, with a hatbattered near the band, coarse carter&rsquo;s boots, black trousers which showedwhite at the knees, and a black coat which was pale at the elbows.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0191" id="link2HCH0191"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;BEGINNING OF A GREAT MALADY</h3><p>On the following day, at the accustomed hour, Marius drew from hiswardrobe his new coat, his new trousers, his new hat, and his new boots;he clothed himself in this complete panoply, put on his gloves, atremendous luxury, and set off for the Luxembourg.</p><p>On the way thither, he encountered Courfeyrac, and pretended not to seehim. Courfeyrac, on his return home, said to his friends:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have just met Marius&rsquo; new hat and new coat, with Marius inside them. Hewas going to pass an examination, no doubt. He looked utterly stupid.&rdquo;</p><p>On arriving at the Luxembourg, Marius made the tour of the fountain basin,and stared at the swans; then he remained for a long time in contemplationbefore a statue whose head was perfectly black with mould, and one ofwhose hips was missing. Near the basin there was a bourgeois forty yearsof age, with a prominent stomach, who was holding by the hand a littleurchin of five, and saying to him: &ldquo;Shun excess, my son, keep at an equaldistance from despotism and from anarchy.&rdquo; Marius listened to thisbourgeois. Then he made the circuit of the basin once more. At last hedirected his course towards &ldquo;his alley,&rdquo; slowly, and as if with regret.One would have said that he was both forced to go there and withheld fromdoing so. He did not perceive it himself, and thought that he was doing ashe always did.</p><p>On turning into the walk, he saw M. Leblanc and the young girl at theother end, &ldquo;on their bench.&rdquo; He buttoned his coat up to the very top,pulled it down on his body so that there might be no wrinkles, examined,with a certain complaisance, the lustrous gleams of his trousers, andmarched on the bench. This march savored of an attack, and certainly of adesire for conquest. So I say that he marched on the bench, as I shouldsay: &ldquo;Hannibal marched on Rome.&rdquo;</p><p>However, all his movements were purely mechanical, and he had interruptednone of the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors. At thatmoment, he was thinking that the <i>Manuel du Baccalauréat</i> was astupid book, and that it must have been drawn up by rare idiots, to allowof three tragedies of Racine and only one comedy of Molière being analyzedtherein as masterpieces of the human mind. There was a piercing whistlinggoing on in his ears. As he approached the bench, he held fast to thefolds in his coat, and fixed his eyes on the young girl. It seemed to himthat she filled the entire extremity of the alley with a vague blue light.</p><p>In proportion as he drew near, his pace slackened more and more. Onarriving at some little distance from the bench, and long before he hadreached the end of the walk, he halted, and could not explain to himselfwhy he retraced his steps. He did not even say to himself that he wouldnot go as far as the end. It was only with difficulty that the young girlcould have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine appearance inhis new clothes. Nevertheless, he held himself very erect, in case any oneshould be looking at him from behind.</p><p>He attained the opposite end, then came back, and this time he approacheda little nearer to the bench. He even got to within three intervals oftrees, but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of proceedingfurther, and he hesitated. He thought he saw the young girl&rsquo;s face bendingtowards him. But he exerted a manly and violent effort, subdued hishesitation, and walked straight ahead. A few seconds later, he rushed infront of the bench, erect and firm, reddening to the very ears, withoutdaring to cast a glance either to the right or to the left, with his handthrust into his coat like a statesman. At the moment when he passed,&mdash;underthe cannon of the place,&mdash;he felt his heart beat wildly. As on thepreceding day, she wore her damask gown and her crape bonnet. He heard anineffable voice, which must have been &ldquo;her voice.&rdquo; She was talkingtranquilly. She was very pretty. He felt it, although he made no attemptto see her. &ldquo;She could not, however,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;help feeling esteem andconsideration for me, if she only knew that I am the veritable author ofthe dissertation on Marcos Obrégon de la Ronde, which M. François deNeufchâteau put, as though it were his own, at the head of his edition of<i>Gil Blas</i>.&rdquo; He went beyond the bench as far as the extremity of thewalk, which was very near, then turned on his heel and passed once more infront of the lovely girl. This time, he was very pale. Moreover, all hisemotions were disagreeable. As he went further from the bench and theyoung girl, and while his back was turned to her, he fancied that she wasgazing after him, and that made him stumble.</p><p>He did not attempt to approach the bench again; he halted near the middleof the walk, and there, a thing which he never did, he sat down, andreflecting in the most profoundly indistinct depths of his spirit, thatafter all, it was hard that persons whose white bonnet and black gown headmired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid trousers and hisnew coat.</p><p>At the expiration of a quarter of an hour, he rose, as though he were onthe point of again beginning his march towards that bench which wassurrounded by an aureole. But he remained standing there, motionless. Forthe first time in fifteen months, he said to himself that that gentlemanwho sat there every day with his daughter, had, on his side, noticed him,and probably considered his assiduity singular.</p><p>For the first time, also, he was conscious of some irreverence indesignating that stranger, even in his secret thoughts, by the sobriquetof M. Leblanc.</p><p>He stood thus for several minutes, with drooping head, tracing figures inthe sand, with the cane which he held in his hand.</p><p>Then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench, to M.Leblanc and his daughter, and went home.</p><p>That day he forgot to dine. At eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening he perceivedthis fact, and as it was too late to go down to the Rue Saint-Jacques, hesaid: &ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; and ate a bit of bread.</p><p>He did not go to bed until he had brushed his coat and folded it up withgreat care.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0192" id="link2HCH0192"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;DIVERS CLAPS OF THUNDER FALL ON MA&rsquo;AM BOUGON</h3><p>On the following day, Ma&rsquo;am Bougon, as Courfeyrac styled the oldportress-principal-tenant, housekeeper of the Gorbeau hovel, Ma&rsquo;am Bougon,whose name was, in reality, Madame Burgon, as we have found out, but thisiconoclast, Courfeyrac, respected nothing,&mdash;Ma&rsquo;am Bougon observed,with stupefaction, that M. Marius was going out again in his new coat.</p><p>He went to the Luxembourg again, but he did not proceed further than hisbench midway of the alley. He seated himself there, as on the precedingday, surveying from a distance, and clearly making out, the white bonnet,the black dress, and above all, that blue light. He did not stir from it,and only went home when the gates of the Luxembourg closed. He did not seeM. Leblanc and his daughter retire. He concluded that they had quitted thegarden by the gate on the Rue de l&rsquo;Ouest. Later on, several weeksafterwards, when he came to think it over, he could never recall where hehad dined that evening.</p><p>On the following day, which was the third, Ma&rsquo;am Bougon was thunderstruck.Marius went out in his new coat. &ldquo;Three days in succession!&rdquo; sheexclaimed.</p><p>She tried to follow him, but Marius walked briskly, and with immensestrides; it was a hippopotamus undertaking the pursuit of a chamois. Shelost sight of him in two minutes, and returned breathless, three-quarterschoked with asthma, and furious. &ldquo;If there is any sense,&rdquo; she growled, &ldquo;inputting on one&rsquo;s best clothes every day, and making people run like this!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius betook himself to the Luxembourg.</p><p>The young girl was there with M. Leblanc. Marius approached as near as hecould, pretending to be busy reading a book, but he halted afar off, thenreturned and seated himself on his bench, where he spent four hours inwatching the house-sparrows who were skipping about the walk, and whoproduced on him the impression that they were making sport of him.</p><p>A fortnight passed thus. Marius went to the Luxembourg no longer for thesake of strolling there, but to seat himself always in the same spot, andthat without knowing why. Once arrived there, he did not stir. He put onhis new coat every morning, for the purpose of not showing himself, and hebegan all over again on the morrow.</p><p>She was decidedly a marvellous beauty. The only remark approaching acriticism, that could be made, was, that the contradiction between hergaze, which was melancholy, and her smile, which was merry, gave a ratherwild effect to her face, which sometimes caused this sweet countenance tobecome strange without ceasing to be charming.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0193" id="link2HCH0193"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;TAKEN PRISONER</h3><p>On one of the last days of the second week, Marius was seated on hisbench, as usual, holding in his hand an open book, of which he had notturned a page for the last two hours. All at once he started. An event wastaking place at the other extremity of the walk. Leblanc and his daughterhad just left their seat, and the daughter had taken her father&rsquo;s arm, andboth were advancing slowly, towards the middle of the alley where Mariuswas. Marius closed his book, then opened it again, then forced himself toread; he trembled; the aureole was coming straight towards him. &ldquo;Ah! goodHeavens!&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;I shall not have time to strike an attitude.&rdquo; Stillthe white-haired man and the girl advanced. It seemed to him that thislasted for a century, and that it was but a second. &ldquo;What are they comingin this direction for?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;What! She will pass here? Herfeet will tread this sand, this walk, two paces from me?&rdquo; He was utterlyupset, he would have liked to be very handsome, he would have liked to ownthe cross. He heard the soft and measured sound of their approachingfootsteps. He imagined that M. Leblanc was darting angry glances at him.&ldquo;Is that gentleman going to address me?&rdquo; he thought to himself. He droppedhis head; when he raised it again, they were very near him. The young girlpassed, and as she passed, she glanced at him. She gazed steadily at him,with a pensive sweetness which thrilled Marius from head to foot. Itseemed to him that she was reproaching him for having allowed so long atime to elapse without coming as far as her, and that she was saying tohim: &ldquo;I am coming myself.&rdquo; Marius was dazzled by those eyes fraught withrays and abysses.</p><p>He felt his brain on fire. She had come to him, what joy! And then, howshe had looked at him! She appeared to him more beautiful than he had everseen her yet. Beautiful with a beauty which was wholly feminine andangelic, with a complete beauty which would have made Petrarch sing andDante kneel. It seemed to him that he was floating free in the azureheavens. At the same time, he was horribly vexed because there was dust onhis boots.</p><p>He thought he felt sure that she had looked at his boots too.</p><p>He followed her with his eyes until she disappeared. Then he started upand walked about the Luxembourg garden like a madman. It is possible that,at times, he laughed to himself and talked aloud. He was so dreamy when hecame near the children&rsquo;s nurses, that each one of them thought him in lovewith her.</p><p>He quitted the Luxembourg, hoping to find her again in the street.</p><p>He encountered Courfeyrac under the arcades of the Odéon, and said to him:&ldquo;Come and dine with me.&rdquo; They went off to Rousseau&rsquo;s and spent six francs.Marius ate like an ogre. He gave the waiter six sous. At dessert, he saidto Courfeyrac. &ldquo;Have you read the paper? What a fine discourse Audry dePuyraveau delivered!&rdquo;</p><p>He was desperately in love.</p><p>After dinner, he said to Courfeyrac: &ldquo;I will treat you to the play.&rdquo; Theywent to the Porte-Sainte-Martin to see Frédérick in <i>l&rsquo;Auberge desAdrets</i>. Marius was enormously amused.</p><p>At the same time, he had a redoubled attack of shyness. On emerging fromthe theatre, he refused to look at the garter of a modiste who wasstepping across a gutter, and Courfeyrac, who said: &ldquo;I should like to putthat woman in my collection,&rdquo; almost horrified him.</p><p>Courfeyrac invited him to breakfast at the Café Voltaire on the followingmorning. Marius went thither, and ate even more than on the precedingevening. He was very thoughtful and very merry. One would have said thathe was taking advantage of every occasion to laugh uproariously. Hetenderly embraced some man or other from the provinces, who was presentedto him. A circle of students formed round the table, and they spoke of thenonsense paid for by the State which was uttered from the rostrum in theSorbonne, then the conversation fell upon the faults and omissions inGuicherat&rsquo;s dictionaries and grammars. Marius interrupted the discussionto exclaim: &ldquo;But it is very agreeable, all the same to have the cross!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer!&rdquo; whispered Courfeyrac to Jean Prouvaire.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; responded Prouvaire, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s serious.&rdquo;</p><p>It was serious; in fact, Marius had reached that first violent andcharming hour with which grand passions begin.</p><p>A glance had wrought all this.</p><p>When the mine is charged, when the conflagration is ready, nothing is moresimple. A glance is a spark.</p><p>It was all over with him. Marius loved a woman. His fate was entering theunknown.</p><p>The glance of women resembles certain combinations of wheels, which aretranquil in appearance yet formidable. You pass close to them every day,peaceably and with impunity, and without a suspicion of anything. A momentarrives when you forget that the thing is there. You go and come, dream,speak, laugh. All at once you feel yourself clutched; all is over. Thewheels hold you fast, the glance has ensnared you. It has caught you, nomatter where or how, by some portion of your thought which was flutteringloose, by some distraction which had attacked you. You are lost. The wholeof you passes into it. A chain of mysterious forces takes possession ofyou. You struggle in vain; no more human succor is possible. You go onfalling from gearing to gearing, from agony to agony, from torture totorture, you, your mind, your fortune, your future, your soul; and,according to whether you are in the power of a wicked creature, or of anoble heart, you will not escape from this terrifying machine otherwisethan disfigured with shame, or transfigured by passion.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0194" id="link2HCH0194"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;ADVENTURES OF THE LETTER U DELIVERED OVER TO CONJECTURES</h3><p>Isolation, detachment, from everything, pride, independence, the taste ofnature, the absence of daily and material activity, the life withinhimself, the secret conflicts of chastity, a benevolent ecstasy towardsall creation, had prepared Marius for this possession which is calledpassion. His worship of his father had gradually become a religion, and,like all religions, it had retreated to the depths of his soul. Somethingwas required in the foreground. Love came.</p><p>A full month elapsed, during which Marius went every day to theLuxembourg. When the hour arrived, nothing could hold him back.&mdash;&ldquo;Heis on duty,&rdquo; said Courfeyrac. Marius lived in a state of delight. It iscertain that the young girl did look at him.</p><p>He had finally grown bold, and approached the bench. Still, he did notpass in front of it any more, in obedience to the instinct of timidity andto the instinct of prudence common to lovers. He considered it better notto attract &ldquo;the attention of the father.&rdquo; He combined his stations behindthe trees and the pedestals of the statues with a profound diplomacy, sothat he might be seen as much as possible by the young girl and as littleas possible by the old gentleman. Sometimes, he remained motionless by thehalf-hour together in the shade of a Leonidas or a Spartacus, holding inhis hand a book, above which his eyes, gently raised, sought the beautifulgirl, and she, on her side, turned her charming profile towards him with avague smile. While conversing in the most natural and tranquil manner inthe world with the white-haired man, she bent upon Marius all the reveriesof a virginal and passionate eye. Ancient and time-honored manœuvrewhich Eve understood from the very first day of the world, and which everywoman understands from the very first day of her life! her mouth repliedto one, and her glance replied to another.</p><p>It must be supposed, that M. Leblanc finally noticed something, for often,when Marius arrived, he rose and began to walk about. He had abandonedtheir accustomed place and had adopted the bench by the Gladiator, nearthe other end of the walk, as though with the object of seeing whetherMarius would pursue them thither. Marius did not understand, and committedthis error. &ldquo;The father&rdquo; began to grow inexact, and no longer brought &ldquo;hisdaughter&rdquo; every day. Sometimes, he came alone. Then Marius did not stay.Another blunder.</p><p>Marius paid no heed to these symptoms. From the phase of timidity, he hadpassed, by a natural and fatal progress, to the phase of blindness. Hislove increased. He dreamed of it every night. And then, an unexpectedbliss had happened to him, oil on the fire, a redoubling of the shadowsover his eyes. One evening, at dusk, he had found, on the bench which &ldquo;M.Leblanc and his daughter&rdquo; had just quitted, a handkerchief, a very simplehandkerchief, without embroidery, but white, and fine, and which seemed tohim to exhale ineffable perfume. He seized it with rapture. Thishandkerchief was marked with the letters U. F. Marius knew nothing aboutthis beautiful child,&mdash;neither her family name, her Christian namenor her abode; these two letters were the first thing of her that he hadgained possession of, adorable initials, upon which he immediately beganto construct his scaffolding. U was evidently the Christian name.&ldquo;Ursule!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;what a delicious name!&rdquo; He kissed the handkerchief,drank it in, placed it on his heart, on his flesh, during the day, and atnight, laid it beneath his lips that he might fall asleep on it.</p><p>&ldquo;I feel that her whole soul lies within it!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p><p>This handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman, who had simply let itfall from his pocket.</p><p>In the days which followed the finding of this treasure, he only displayedhimself at the Luxembourg in the act of kissing the handkerchief andlaying it on his heart. The beautiful child understood nothing of allthis, and signified it to him by imperceptible signs.</p><p>&ldquo;O modesty!&rdquo; said Marius.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0195" id="link2HCH0195"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE VETERANS THEMSELVES CAN BE HAPPY</h3><p>Since we have pronounced the word modesty, and since we conceal nothing,we ought to say that once, nevertheless, in spite of his ecstasies, &ldquo;hisUrsule&rdquo; caused him very serious grief. It was on one of the days when shepersuaded M. Leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk. A briskMay breeze was blowing, which swayed the crests of the plaintain-trees.The father and daughter, arm in arm, had just passed Marius&rsquo; bench. Mariushad risen to his feet behind them, and was following them with his eyes,as was fitting in the desperate situation of his soul.</p><p>All at once, a gust of wind, more merry than the rest, and probablycharged with performing the affairs of Springtime, swept down from thenursery, flung itself on the alley, enveloped the young girl in adelicious shiver, worthy of Virgil&rsquo;s nymphs, and the fawns of Theocritus,and lifted her dress, the robe more sacred than that of Isis, almost tothe height of her garter. A leg of exquisite shape appeared. Marius sawit. He was exasperated and furious.</p><p>The young girl had hastily thrust down her dress, with a divinely troubledmotion, but he was nonetheless angry for all that. He was alone in thealley, it is true. But there might have been some one there. And what ifthere had been some one there! Can any one comprehend such a thing? Whatshe had just done is horrible!&mdash;Alas, the poor child had donenothing; there had been but one culprit, the wind; but Marius, in whomquivered the Bartholo who exists in Cherubin, was determined to be vexed,and was jealous of his own shadow. It is thus, in fact, that the harsh andcapricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in the human heart, and takespossession of it, even without any right. Moreover, setting aside eventhat jealousy, the sight of that charming leg had contained nothingagreeable for him; the white stocking of the first woman he chanced tomeet would have afforded him more pleasure.</p><p>When &ldquo;his Ursule,&rdquo; after having reached the end of the walk, retraced hersteps with M. Leblanc, and passed in front of the bench on which Mariushad seated himself once more, Marius darted a sullen and ferocious glanceat her. The young girl gave way to that slight straightening up with abackward movement, accompanied by a raising of the eyelids, whichsignifies: &ldquo;Well, what is the matter?&rdquo;</p><p>This was &ldquo;their first quarrel.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes, when some onecrossed the walk. It was a veteran, very much bent, extremely wrinkled,and pale, in a uniform of the Louis XV. pattern, bearing on his breast thelittle oval plaque of red cloth, with the crossed swords, the soldier&rsquo;scross of Saint-Louis, and adorned, in addition, with a coat-sleeve, whichhad no arm within it, with a silver chin and a wooden leg. Marius thoughthe perceived that this man had an extremely well satisfied air. It evenstruck him that the aged cynic, as he hobbled along past him, addressed tohim a very fraternal and very merry wink, as though some chance hadcreated an understanding between them, and as though they had shared somepiece of good luck together. What did that relic of Mars mean by being socontented? What had passed between that wooden leg and the other? Mariusreached a paroxysm of jealousy.&mdash;&ldquo;Perhaps he was there!&rdquo; he said tohimself; &ldquo;perhaps he saw!&rdquo;&mdash;And he felt a desire to exterminate theveteran.</p><p>With the aid of time, all points grow dull. Marius&rsquo; wrath against&ldquo;Ursule,&rdquo; just and legitimate as it was, passed off. He finally pardonedher; but this cost him a great effort; he sulked for three days.</p><p>Nevertheless, in spite of all this, and because of all this, his passionaugmented and grew to madness.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0196" id="link2HCH0196"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;ECLIPSE</h3><p>The reader has just seen how Marius discovered, or thought that hediscovered, that <i>She</i> was named Ursule.</p><p>Appetite grows with loving. To know that her name was Ursule was a greatdeal; it was very little. In three or four weeks, Marius had devoured thisbliss. He wanted another. He wanted to know where she lived.</p><p>He had committed his first blunder, by falling into the ambush of thebench by the Gladiator. He had committed a second, by not remaining at theLuxembourg when M. Leblanc came thither alone. He now committed a third,and an immense one. He followed &ldquo;Ursule.&rdquo;</p><p>She lived in the Rue de l&rsquo;Ouest, in the most unfrequented spot, in a new,three-story house, of modest appearance.</p><p>From that moment forth, Marius added to his happiness of seeing her at theLuxembourg the happiness of following her home.</p><p>His hunger was increasing. He knew her first name, at least, a charmingname, a genuine woman&rsquo;s name; he knew where she lived; he wanted to knowwho she was.</p><p>One evening, after he had followed them to their dwelling, and had seenthem disappear through the carriage gate, he entered in their train andsaid boldly to the porter:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor, who has just comein?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the porter. &ldquo;He is the gentleman on the third floor.&rdquo;</p><p>Another step gained. This success emboldened Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;On the front?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Parbleu!&rdquo; said the porter, &ldquo;the house is only built on the street.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what is that gentleman&rsquo;s business?&rdquo; began Marius again.</p><p>&ldquo;He is a gentleman of property, sir. A very kind man who does good to theunfortunate, though not rich himself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo; resumed Marius.</p><p>The porter raised his head and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you a police spy, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius went off quite abashed, but delighted. He was getting on.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;I know that her name is Ursule, that she is thedaughter of a gentleman who lives on his income, and that she lives there,on the third floor, in the Rue de l&rsquo;Ouest.&rdquo;</p><p>On the following day, M. Leblanc and his daughter made only a very briefstay in the Luxembourg; they went away while it was still broad daylight.Marius followed them to the Rue de l&rsquo;Ouest, as he had taken up the habitof doing. On arriving at the carriage entrance M. Leblanc made hisdaughter pass in first, then paused, before crossing the threshold, andstared intently at Marius.</p><p>On the next day they did not come to the Luxembourg. Marius waited forthem all day in vain.</p><p>At nightfall, he went to the Rue de l&rsquo;Ouest, and saw a light in thewindows of the third story.</p><p>He walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished.</p><p>The next day, no one at the Luxembourg. Marius waited all day, then wentand did sentinel duty under their windows. This carried him on to teno&rsquo;clock in the evening.</p><p>His dinner took care of itself. Fever nourishes the sick man, and love thelover.</p><p>He spent a week in this manner. M. Leblanc no longer appeared at theLuxembourg.</p><p>Marius indulged in melancholy conjectures; he dared not watch theporte-cochère during the day; he contented himself with going at nightto gaze upon the red light of the windows. At times he saw shadowsflit across them, and his heart began to beat.</p><p>On the eighth day, when he arrived under the windows, there was no lightin them.</p><p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the lamp is not lighted yet. But it is dark. Can theyhave gone out?&rdquo; He waited until ten o&rsquo;clock. Until midnight. Until one inthe morning. Not a light appeared in the windows of the third story, andno one entered the house.</p><p>He went away in a very gloomy frame of mind.</p><p>On the morrow,&mdash;for he only existed from morrow to morrow, there was,so to speak, no to-day for him,&mdash;on the morrow, he found no one atthe Luxembourg; he had expected this. At dusk, he went to the house.</p><p>No light in the windows; the shades were drawn; the third floor wastotally dark.</p><p>Marius rapped at the porte-cochère, entered, and said to the porter:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The gentleman on the third floor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Has moved away,&rdquo; replied the porter.</p><p>Marius reeled and said feebly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;How long ago?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is he living now?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So he has not left his new address?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>And the porter, raising his eyes, recognized Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Come!

The social soil is everywhere undermined, sometimes forgood, sometimes for evil. These works are superposed one upon the other.There are superior mines and inferior mines. There is a top and a bottomin this obscure sub-soil, which sometimes gives way beneath civilization,and which our indifference and heedlessness trample under foot. TheEncyclopedia, in the last century, was a mine that was almost open to thesky. The shades, those sombre hatchers of primitive Christianity, onlyawaited an opportunity to bring about an explosion under the Cæsars and toinundate the human race with light. For in the sacred shadows there lieslatent light. Volcanoes are full of a shadow that is capable of flashingforth. Every form begins by being night. The catacombs, in which the firstmass was said, were not alone the cellar of Rome, they were the vaults ofthe world.</p><p>Beneath the social construction, that complicated marvel of a structure,there are excavations of all sorts. There is the religious mine, thephilosophical mine, the economic mine, the revolutionary mine. Such andsuch a pick-axe with the idea, such a pick with ciphers. Such another withwrath. People hail and answer each other from one catacomb to another.Utopias travel about underground, in the pipes. There they branch out inevery direction. They sometimes meet, and fraternize there. Jean-Jacqueslends his pick to Diogenes, who lends him his lantern. Sometimes theyenter into combat there. Calvin seizes Socinius by the hair. But nothingarrests nor interrupts the tension of all these energies toward the goal,and the vast, simultaneous activity, which goes and comes, mounts,descends, and mounts again in these obscurities, and which immense unknownswarming slowly transforms the top and the bottom and the inside and theoutside. Society hardly even suspects this digging which leaves itssurface intact and changes its bowels. There are as many differentsubterranean stages as there are varying works, as there are extractions.What emerges from these deep excavations? The future.</p><p>The deeper one goes, the more mysterious are the toilers. The work isgood, up to a degree which the social philosophies are able to recognize;beyond that degree it is doubtful and mixed; lower down, it becomesterrible. At a certain depth, the excavations are no longer penetrable bythe spirit of civilization, the limit breathable by man has been passed; abeginning of monsters is possible.</p><p>The descending scale is a strange one; and each one of the rungs of thisladder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can find foothold, andwhere one encounters one of these workmen, sometimes divine, sometimesmisshapen. Below John Huss, there is Luther; below Luther, there isDescartes; below Descartes, there is Voltaire; below Voltaire, there isCondorcet; below Condorcet, there is Robespierre; below Robespierre, thereis Marat; below Marat there is Babeuf. And so it goes on. Lower down,confusedly, at the limit which separates the indistinct from theinvisible, one perceives other gloomy men, who perhaps do not exist asyet. The men of yesterday are spectres; those of to-morrow are forms. Theeye of the spirit distinguishes them but obscurely. The embryonic work ofthe future is one of the visions of philosophy.</p><p>A world in limbo, in the state of fœtus, what an unheard-of spectre!</p><p>Saint-Simon, Owen, Fourier, are there also, in lateral galleries.</p><p>Surely, although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves, bindstogether all these subterranean pioneers who, almost always, thinkthemselves isolated, and who are not so, their works vary greatly, and thelight of some contrasts with the blaze of others. The first areparadisiacal, the last are tragic. Nevertheless, whatever may be thecontrast, all these toilers, from the highest to the most nocturnal, fromthe wisest to the most foolish, possess one likeness, and this is it:disinterestedness. Marat forgets himself like Jesus. They throw themselveson one side, they omit themselves, they think not of themselves. They havea glance, and that glance seeks the absolute. The first has the wholeheavens in his eyes; the last, enigmatical though he may be, has still,beneath his eyelids, the pale beam of the infinite. Venerate the man,whoever he may be, who has this sign&mdash;the starry eye.</p><p>The shadowy eye is the other sign.</p><p>With it, evil commences. Reflect and tremble in the presence of any onewho has no glance at all. The social order has its black miners.</p><p>There is a point where depth is tantamount to burial, and where lightbecomes extinct.</p><p>Below all these mines which we have just mentioned, below all thesegalleries, below this whole immense, subterranean, venous system ofprogress and utopia, much further on in the earth, much lower than Marat,lower than Babeuf, lower, much lower, and without any connection with theupper levels, there lies the last mine. A formidable spot. This is what wehave designated as the <i>le troisième dessous</i>. It is the grave ofshadows. It is the cellar of the blind. <i>Inferi</i>.</p><p>This communicates with the abyss.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0198" id="link2HCH0198"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE LOWEST DEPTHS</h3><p>There disinterestedness vanishes. The demon is vaguely outlined; each oneis for himself. The <i>I</i> in the eyes howls, seeks, fumbles, and gnaws.The social Ugolino is in this gulf.</p><p>The wild spectres who roam in this grave, almost beasts, almost phantoms,are not occupied with universal progress; they are ignorant both of theidea and of the word; they take no thought for anything but thesatisfaction of their individual desires. They are almost unconscious, andthere exists within them a sort of terrible obliteration. They have twomothers, both step-mothers, ignorance and misery. They have a guide,necessity; and for all forms of satisfaction, appetite. They are brutallyvoracious, that is to say, ferocious, not after the fashion of the tyrant,but after the fashion of the tiger. From suffering these spectres pass tocrime; fatal affiliation, dizzy creation, logic of darkness. That whichcrawls in the social third lower level is no longer complaint stifled bythe absolute; it is the protest of matter. Man there becomes a dragon. Tobe hungry, to be thirsty&mdash;that is the point of departure; to be Satan&mdash;thatis the point reached. From that vault Lacenaire emerges.</p><p>We have just seen, in Book Fourth, one of the compartments of the uppermine, of the great political, revolutionary, and philosophical excavation.There, as we have just said, all is pure, noble, dignified, honest. There,assuredly, one might be misled; but error is worthy of veneration there,so thoroughly does it imply heroism. The work there effected, taken as awhole has a name: Progress.</p><p>The moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths, hideousdepths. There exists beneath society, we insist upon this point, and therewill exist, until that day when ignorance shall be dissipated, the greatcavern of evil.</p><p>This cavern is below all, and is the foe of all. It is hatred, withoutexception. This cavern knows no philosophers; its dagger has never cut apen. Its blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of theinkstand. Never have the fingers of night which contract beneath thisstifling ceiling, turned the leaves of a book nor unfolded a newspaper.Babeuf is a speculator to Cartouche; Marat is an aristocrat toSchinderhannes.

For his lair he had thesewer of the Arche-Marion. He was six feet high, his pectoral muscles wereof marble, his biceps of brass, his breath was that of a cavern, his torsothat of a colossus, his head that of a bird. One thought one beheld theFarnese Hercules clad in duck trousers and a cotton velvet waistcoat.Gueulemer, built after this sculptural fashion, might have subduedmonsters; he had found it more expeditious to be one. A low brow, largetemples, less than forty years of age, but with crow&rsquo;s-feet, harsh, shorthair, cheeks like a brush, a beard like that of a wild boar; the readercan see the man before him. His muscles called for work, his stupiditywould have none of it. He was a great, idle force. He was an assassinthrough coolness. He was thought to be a creole. He had, probably,somewhat to do with Marshal Brune, having been a porter at Avignon in1815. After this stage, he had turned ruffian.</p><p>The diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the grossness of Gueulemer. Babetwas thin and learned. He was transparent but impenetrable. Daylight wasvisible through his bones, but nothing through his eyes. He declared thathe was a chemist. He had been a jack of all trades. He had played invaudeville at Saint-Mihiel. He was a man of purpose, a fine talker, whounderlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures. His occupationconsisted in selling, in the open air, plaster busts and portraits of &ldquo;thehead of the State.&rdquo; In addition to this, he extracted teeth. He hadexhibited phenomena at fairs, and he had owned a booth with a trumpet andthis poster: &ldquo;Babet, Dental Artist, Member of the Academies, makesphysical experiments on metals and metalloids, extracts teeth, undertakesstumps abandoned by his brother practitioners. Price: one tooth, onefranc, fifty centimes; two teeth, two francs; three teeth, two francs,fifty. Take advantage of this opportunity.&rdquo; This <i>Take advantage of thisopportunity</i> meant: Have as many teeth extracted as possible. He hadbeen married and had had children. He did not know what had become of hiswife and children. He had lost them as one loses his handkerchief. Babetread the papers, a striking exception in the world to which he belonged.One day, at the period when he had his family with him in his booth onwheels, he had read in the <i>Messager</i>, that a woman had just givenbirth to a child, who was doing well, and had a calf&rsquo;s muzzle, and heexclaimed: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fortune! my wife has not the wit to present me witha child like that!&rdquo;</p><p>Later on he had abandoned everything, in order to &ldquo;undertake Paris.&rdquo; Thiswas his expression.</p><p>Who was Claquesous? He was night. He waited until the sky was daubed withblack, before he showed himself. At nightfall he emerged from the holewhither he returned before daylight. Where was this hole? No one knew. Heonly addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness, and with hisback turned to them. Was his name Claquesous? Certainly not. If a candlewas brought, he put on a mask. He was a ventriloquist. Babet said:&ldquo;Claquesous is a nocturne for two voices.&rdquo; Claquesous was vague, terrible,and a roamer. No one was sure whether he had a name, Claquesous being asobriquet; none was sure that he had a voice, as his stomach spoke morefrequently than his voice; no one was sure that he had a face, as he wasnever seen without his mask. He disappeared as though he had vanished intothin air; when he appeared, it was as though he sprang from the earth.</p><p>A lugubrious being was Montparnasse. Montparnasse was a child; less thantwenty years of age, with a handsome face, lips like cherries, charmingblack hair, the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes; he had allvices and aspired to all crimes.</p><p>The digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse. It was thestreet boy turned pickpocket, and a pickpocket turned garroter. He wasgenteel, effeminate, graceful, robust, sluggish, ferocious. The rim of hishat was curled up on the left side, in order to make room for a tuft ofhair, after the style of 1829. He lived by robbery with violence. His coatwas of the best cut, but threadbare. Montparnasse was a fashion-plate inmisery and given to the commission of murders. The cause of all thisyouth&rsquo;s crimes was the desire to be well-dressed. The first grisette whohad said to him: &ldquo;You are handsome!&rdquo; had cast the stain of darkness intohis heart, and had made a Cain of this Abel. Finding that he was handsome,he desired to be elegant: now, the height of elegance is idleness;idleness in a poor man means crime. Few prowlers were so dreaded asMontparnasse. At eighteen, he had already numerous corpses in his past.More than one passer-by lay with outstretched arms in the presence of thiswretch, with his face in a pool of blood. Curled, pomaded, with lacedwaist, the hips of a woman, the bust of a Prussian officer, the murmur ofadmiration from the boulevard wenches surrounding him, his cravatknowingly tied, a bludgeon in his pocket, a flower in his buttonhole; suchwas this dandy of the sepulchre.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0200" id="link2HCH0200"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;COMPOSITION OF THE TROUPE</h3><p>These four ruffians formed a sort of Proteus, winding like a serpent amongthe police, and striving to escape Vidocq&rsquo;s indiscreet glances &ldquo;underdivers forms, tree, flame, fountain,&rdquo; lending each other their names andtheir traps, hiding in their own shadows, boxes with secret compartmentsand refuges for each other, stripping off their personalities, as oneremoves his false nose at a masked ball, sometimes simplifying matters tothe point of consisting of but one individual, sometimes multiplyingthemselves to such a point that Coco-Latour himself took them for a wholethrong.</p><p>These four men were not four men; they were a sort of mysterious robberwith four heads, operating on a grand scale on Paris; they were thatmonstrous polyp of evil, which inhabits the crypt of society.</p><p>Thanks to their ramifications, and to the network underlying theirrelations, Babet, Gueulemer, Claquesous, and Montparnasse were chargedwith the general enterprise of the ambushes of the department of theSeine. The inventors of ideas of that nature, men with nocturnalimaginations, applied to them to have their ideas executed. They furnishedthe canvas to the four rascals, and the latter undertook the preparationof the scenery. They labored at the stage setting. They were always in acondition to lend a force proportioned and suitable to all crimes whichdemanded a lift of the shoulder, and which were sufficiently lucrative.When a crime was in quest of arms, they under-let their accomplices. Theykept a troupe of actors of the shadows at the disposition of allunderground tragedies.</p><p>They were in the habit of assembling at nightfall, the hour when they wokeup, on the plains which adjoin the Salpêtrière. There they held theirconferences. They had twelve black hours before them; they regulated theiremployment accordingly.</p><p><i>Patron-Minette</i>,&mdash;such was the name which was bestowed in thesubterranean circulation on the association of these four men. In thefantastic, ancient, popular parlance, which is vanishing day by day, <i>Patron-Minette</i>signifies the morning, the same as <i>entre chien et loup</i>&mdash;betweendog and wolf&mdash;signifies the evening. This appellation, <i>Patron-Minette</i>,was probably derived from the hour at which their work ended, the dawnbeing the vanishing moment for phantoms and for the separation ofruffians. These four men were known under this title. When the Presidentof the Assizes visited Lacenaire in his prison, and questioned himconcerning a misdeed which Lacenaire denied, &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; demanded thePresident. Lacenaire made this response, enigmatical so far as themagistrate was concerned, but clear to the police: &ldquo;Perhaps it wasPatron-Minette.&rdquo;</p><p>A piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages; inthe same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffianscomposing it. Here are the appellations to which the principal members ofPatron-Minette answered,&mdash;for the names have survived in specialmemoirs.</p><p>Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille.</p><p>Brujon. [There was a Brujon dynasty; we cannot refrain from interpolatingthis word.]</p><p>Boulatruelle, the road-mender already introduced.</p><p>Laveuve.</p><p>Finistère.</p><p>Homère-Hogu, a negro.</p><p>Mardisoir. (Tuesday evening.)</p><p>Dépêche. (Make haste.)</p><p>Fauntleroy, alias Bouquetière (the Flower Girl).</p><p>Glorieux, a discharged convict.</p><p>Barrecarrosse (Stop-carriage), called Monsieur Dupont.</p><p>L&rsquo;Esplanade-du-Sud.</p><p>Poussagrive.</p><p>Carmagnolet.</p><p>Kruideniers, called Bizarro.</p><p>Mangedentelle. (Lace-eater.)</p><p>Les-pieds-en-l&rsquo;Air. (Feet in the air.)</p><p>Demi-Liard, called Deux-Milliards.</p><p>Etc., etc.</p><p>We pass over some, and not the worst of them. These names have facesattached. They do not express merely beings, but species. Each one ofthese names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from theunder side of civilization.</p><p>Those beings, who were not very lavish with their countenances, were notamong the men whom one sees passing along the streets. Fatigued by thewild nights which they passed, they went off by day to sleep, sometimes inthe lime-kilns, sometimes in the abandoned quarries of Montmatre orMontrouge, sometimes in the sewers. They ran to earth.</p><p>What became of these men? They still exist. They have always existed.Horace speaks of them: <i>Ambubaiarum collegia, pharmacopolæ, mendici,mimæ</i>; and so long as society remains what it is, they will remain whatthey are. Beneath the obscure roof of their cavern, they are continuallyborn again from the social ooze. They return, spectres, but alwaysidentical; only, they no longer bear the same names and they are no longerin the same skins. The individuals extirpated, the tribe subsists.</p><p>They always have the same faculties. From the vagrant to the tramp, therace is maintained in its purity. They divine purses in pockets, theyscent out watches in fobs. Gold and silver possess an odor for them. Thereexist ingenuous bourgeois, of whom it might be said, that they have a&ldquo;stealable&rdquo; air. These men patiently pursue these bourgeois. Theyexperience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or of aman from the country.</p><p>These men are terrible, when one encounters them, or catches a glimpse ofthem, towards midnight, on a deserted boulevard. They do not seem to bemen but forms composed of living mists; one would say that they habituallyconstitute one mass with the shadows, that they are in no wise distinctfrom them, that they possess no other soul than the darkness, and that itis only momentarily and for the purpose of living for a few minutes amonstrous life, that they have separated from the night.</p><p>What is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish? Light. Light infloods. Not a single bat can resist the dawn. Light up society from below.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0230" id="link2H_4_0230"></a>BOOK EIGHTH&mdash;THE WICKED POOR MAN</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0201" id="link2HCH0201"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;MARIUS, WHILE SEEKING A GIRL IN A BONNET, ENCOUNTERS A MANIN A CAP</h3><p>Summer passed, then the autumn; winter came. Neither M. Leblanc nor theyoung girl had again set foot in the Luxembourg garden. Thenceforth,Marius had but one thought,&mdash;to gaze once more on that sweet andadorable face. He sought constantly, he sought everywhere; he foundnothing. He was no longer Marius, the enthusiastic dreamer, the firm,resolute, ardent man, the bold defier of fate, the brain which erectedfuture on future, the young spirit encumbered with plans, with projects,with pride, with ideas and wishes; he was a lost dog. He fell into a blackmelancholy. All was over. Work disgusted him, walking tired him. Vastnature, formerly so filled with forms, lights, voices, counsels,perspectives, horizons, teachings, now lay empty before him. It seemed tohim that everything had disappeared.</p><p>He thought incessantly, for he could not do otherwise; but he no longertook pleasure in his thoughts. To everything that they proposed to him ina whisper, he replied in his darkness: &ldquo;What is the use?&rdquo;</p><p>He heaped a hundred reproaches on himself. &ldquo;Why did I follow her? I was sohappy at the mere sight of her! She looked at me; was not that immense?She had the air of loving me. Was not that everything? I wished to have,what? There was nothing after that. I have been absurd. It is my ownfault,&rdquo; etc., etc. Courfeyrac, to whom he confided nothing,&mdash;it washis nature,&mdash;but who made some little guess at everything,&mdash;thatwas his nature,&mdash;had begun by congratulating him on being in love,though he was amazed at it; then, seeing Marius fall into this melancholystate, he ended by saying to him: &ldquo;I see that you have been simply ananimal. Here, come to the Chaumière.&rdquo;</p><p>Once, having confidence in a fine September sun, Marius had allowedhimself to be taken to the ball at Sceaux by Courfeyrac, Bossuet, andGrantaire, hoping, what a dream! that he might, perhaps, find her there.Of course he did not see the one he sought.&mdash;&ldquo;But this is the place,all the same, where all lost women are found,&rdquo; grumbled Grantaire in anaside. Marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot,alone, through the night, weary, feverish, with sad and troubled eyes,stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singingcreatures on their way home from the feast, which passed close to him, ashe, in his discouragement, breathed in the acrid scent of thewalnut-trees, along the road, in order to refresh his head.</p><p>He took to living more and more alone, utterly overwhelmed, wholly givenup to his inward anguish, going and coming in his pain like the wolf inthe trap, seeking the absent one everywhere, stupefied by love.</p><p>On another occasion, he had an encounter which produced on him a singulareffect. He met, in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the Boulevard desInvalides, a man dressed like a workingman and wearing a cap with a longvisor, which allowed a glimpse of locks of very white hair. Marius wasstruck with the beauty of this white hair, and scrutinized the man, whowas walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful meditation. Strangeto say, he thought that he recognized M. Leblanc. The hair was the same,also the profile, so far as the cap permitted a view of it, the mienidentical, only more depressed. But why these workingman&rsquo;s clothes? Whatwas the meaning of this? What signified that disguise? Marius was greatlyastonished. When he recovered himself, his first impulse was to follow theman; who knows whether he did not hold at last the clue which he wasseeking? In any case, he must see the man near at hand, and clear up themystery. But the idea occurred to him too late, the man was no longerthere. He had turned into some little side street, and Marius could notfind him. This encounter occupied his mind for three days and then waseffaced. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;it was probably only aresemblance.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0202" id="link2HCH0202"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;TREASURE TROVE</h3><p>Marius had not left the Gorbeau house. He paid no attention to any onethere.</p><p>At that epoch, to tell the truth, there were no other inhabitants in thehouse, except himself and those Jondrettes whose rent he had once paid,without, moreover, ever having spoken to either father, mother, ordaughters. The other lodgers had moved away or had died, or had beenturned out in default of payment.</p><p>One day during that winter, the sun had shown itself a little in theafternoon, but it was the 2d of February, that ancient Candlemas day whosetreacherous sun, the precursor of a six weeks&rsquo; cold spell, inspiredMathieu Laensberg with these two lines, which have with justice remainedclassic:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Qu&rsquo;il luise ou qu&rsquo;il luiserne,<br/>L&rsquo;ours rentre dans en sa caverne.<a href="#linknote-26" name="linknoteref-26" id="linknoteref-26">26</a></p><p>Marius had just emerged from his: night was falling. It was the hour forhis dinner; for he had been obliged to take to dining again, alas! oh,infirmities of ideal passions!</p><p>He had just crossed his threshold, where Ma&rsquo;am Bougon was sweeping at themoment, as she uttered this memorable monologue:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What is there that is cheap now? Everything is dear. There is nothing inthe world that is cheap except trouble; you can get that for nothing, thetrouble of the world!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier, in order toreach the Rue Saint-Jacques. He was walking along with drooping head.</p><p>All at once, he felt some one elbow him in the dusk; he wheeled round, andsaw two young girls clad in rags, the one tall and slim, the other alittle shorter, who were passing rapidly, all out of breath, in terror,and with the appearance of fleeing; they had been coming to meet him, hadnot seen him, and had jostled him as they passed. Through the twilight,Marius could distinguish their livid faces, their wild heads, theirdishevelled hair, their hideous bonnets, their ragged petticoats, andtheir bare feet. They were talking as they ran. The taller said in a verylow voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The bobbies have come. They came near nabbing me at the half-circle.&rdquo; Theother answered: &ldquo;I saw them. I bolted, bolted, bolted!&rdquo;</p><p>Through this repulsive slang, Marius understood that gendarmes or thepolice had come near apprehending these two children, and that the latterhad escaped.</p><p>They plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him, and therecreated, for a few minutes, in the gloom, a sort of vague white spot, thendisappeared.</p><p>Marius had halted for a moment.</p><p>He was about to pursue his way, when his eye lighted on a little grayishpackage lying on the ground at his feet. He stooped and picked it up. Itwas a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;those unhappy girls dropped it.&rdquo;</p><p>He retraced his steps, he called, he did not find them; he reflected thatthey must already be far away, put the package in his pocket, and went offto dine.</p><p>On the way, he saw in an alley of the Rue Mouffetard, a child&rsquo;s coffin,covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs, and illuminated by acandle. The two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Poor mothers!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;There is one thing sadder than to see one&rsquo;schildren die; it is to see them leading an evil life.&rdquo;</p><p>Then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from histhoughts, and he fell back once more into his habitual preoccupations. Hefell to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness in theopen air and the broad daylight, beneath the beautiful trees ofLuxembourg.</p><p>&ldquo;How gloomy my life has become!&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Young girls arealways appearing to me, only formerly they were angels and now they areghouls.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0203" id="link2HCH0203"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;QUADRIFRONS</h3><p>That evening, as he was undressing preparatory to going to bed, his handcame in contact, in the pocket of his coat, with the packet which he hadpicked up on the boulevard. He had forgotten it. He thought that it wouldbe well to open it, and that this package might possibly contain theaddress of the young girls, if it really belonged to them, and, in anycase, the information necessary to a restitution to the person who hadlost it.</p><p>He opened the envelope.</p><p>It was not sealed and contained four letters, also unsealed.</p><p>They bore addresses.</p><p>All four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco.</p><p>The first was addressed: <i>&ldquo;To Madame, Madame la Marquise de Grucheray,the place opposite the Chamber of Deputies, No.&mdash;&rdquo;</i></p><p>Marius said to himself, that he should probably find in it the informationwhich he sought, and that, moreover, the letter being open, it wasprobable that it could be read without impropriety.</p><p>It was conceived as follows:&mdash;</p><p>Madame la Marquise: The virtue of clemency and piety is that which mostclosely unites sosiety.

The subject is historical,and the action takes place in Auvergne in the time of the Empire; the style, Ithink, is natural, laconic, and may have some merit. There are couplets to besung in four places. The comic, the serious, the unexpected, are mingled in avariety of characters, and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through allthe intrigue which proceeds misteriously, and ends, after striking altarations,in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes.<br/>    My principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively animatesthe man of our century, that is to say, the fashion, that capritious andbizarre weathervane which changes at almost every new wind.<br/>    In spite of these qualities I have reason to fear that jealousy, theegotism of priviliged authors, may obtaine my exclusion from the theatre, for Iam not ignorant of the mortifications with which newcomers are treated.<br/>    Monsiuer Pabourgeot, your just reputation as an enlightened protector ofmen of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will explain ourindigant situation to you, lacking bread and fire in this wynter season.

If you deign to honor me with themost modest offering, I shall immediately occupy myself in making a piesse ofverse to pay you my tribute of gratitude. Which I shall endeavor to render thispiesse as perfect as possible, will be sent to you before it is inserted at thebeginning of the drama and delivered on the stage.</p><p class="right">To Monsieur<br/>and Madame Pabourgeot,<br/>My most respectful complements,<br/>G<small>ENFLOT</small>, man of letters.</p><p class="letter">P. S. Even if it is only forty sous.<br/>    Excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself,but sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me,alas! to go out.</p><p>Finally, Marius opened the fourth letter. The address ran: <i>To thebenevolent Gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-haut-Pas</i>. Itcontained the following lines:&mdash;</p><p class="letter">B<small>ENEVOLENT MAN</small>: If you deign to accompany my daughter, you willbehold a misserable calamity, and I will show you my certificates.<br/>     Atthe aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved with a sentimentof obvious benevolence, for true philosophers always feel lively emotions.<br/>    Admit, compassionate man, that it is necessary to suffer the most cruelneed, and that it is very painful, for the sake of obtaining a little relief,to get oneself attested by the authorities as though one were not free tosuffer and to die of inanition while waiting to have our misery relieved.

F<small>ABANTOU</small>, dramatic artist.</p><p>After perusing these four letters, Marius did not find himself muchfurther advanced than before.</p><p>In the first place, not one of the signers gave his address.</p><p>Then, they seemed to come from four different individuals, Don Alvarès,Mistress Balizard, the poet Genflot, and dramatic artist Fabantou; but thesingular thing about these letters was, that all four were written by thesame hand.</p><p>What conclusion was to be drawn from this, except that they all come fromthe same person?</p><p>Moreover, and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable, thecoarse and yellow paper was the same in all four, the odor of tobacco wasthe same, and, although an attempt had been made to vary the style, thesame orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest tranquillity,and the man of letters Genflot was no more exempt from them than theSpanish captain.</p><p>It was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery. Had it notbeen a chance find, it would have borne the air of a mystification. Mariuswas too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well, and to lendhimself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous ofplaying with him. It seemed to him that he was playing the part of theblind man in blind man&rsquo;s buff between the four letters, and that they weremaking sport of him.</p><p>Nothing, however, indicated that these letters belonged to the two younggirls whom Marius had met on the boulevard. After all, they were evidentlypapers of no value. Marius replaced them in their envelope, flung thewhole into a corner and went to bed. About seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning,he had just risen and breakfasted, and was trying to settle down to work,when there came a soft knock at his door.</p><p>As he owned nothing, he never locked his door, unless occasionally, thoughvery rarely, when he was engaged in some pressing work. Even when absenthe left his key in the lock. &ldquo;You will be robbed,&rdquo; said Ma&rsquo;am Bougon. &ldquo;Ofwhat?&rdquo; said Marius. The truth is, however, that he had, one day, beenrobbed of an old pair of boots, to the great triumph of Ma&rsquo;am Bougon.</p><p>There came a second knock, as gentle as the first.</p><p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want, Ma&rsquo;am Bougon?&rdquo; asked Marius, without raising his eyesfrom the books and manuscripts on his table.</p><p>A voice which did not belong to Ma&rsquo;am Bougon replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>It was a dull, broken, hoarse, strangled voice, the voice of an old man,roughened with brandy and liquor.</p><p>Marius turned round hastily, and beheld a young girl.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0204" id="link2HCH0204"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;A ROSE IN MISERY</h3><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0026" id="linkimage-0026"></a><img src="images/3b8-4-rose-in-misery.jpg" alt="Rose in Misery" width="100%" /></div><p>A very young girl was standing in the half-open door. The dormer window ofthe garret, through which the light fell, was precisely opposite the door,and illuminated the figure with a wan light. She was a frail, emaciated,slender creature; there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat uponthat chilled and shivering nakedness. Her girdle was a string, her headribbon a string, her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise, a blondand lymphatic pallor, earth-colored collar-bones, red hands, a half-openand degraded mouth, missing teeth, dull, bold, base eyes; she had the formof a young girl who has missed her youth, and the look of a corrupt oldwoman; fifty years mingled with fifteen; one of those beings which areboth feeble and horrible, and which cause those to shudder whom they donot cause to weep.</p><p>Marius had risen, and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being, whowas almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams.</p><p>The most heart-breaking thing of all was, that this young girl had notcome into the world to be homely. In her early childhood she must evenhave been pretty. The grace of her age was still struggling against thehideous, premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty. The remains ofbeauty were dying away in that face of sixteen, like the pale sunlightwhich is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a winter&rsquo;s day.</p><p>That face was not wholly unknown to Marius. He thought he rememberedhaving seen it somewhere.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you wish, Mademoiselle?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>The young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Here is a letter for you, Monsieur Marius.&rdquo;</p><p>She called Marius by his name; he could not doubt that he was the personwhom she wanted; but who was this girl? How did she know his name?</p><p>Without waiting for him to tell her to advance, she entered. She enteredresolutely, staring, with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed,at the whole room and the unmade bed. Her feet were bare. Large holes inher petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees. Shewas shivering.</p><p>She held a letter in her hand, which she presented to Marius.</p><p>Marius, as he opened the letter, noticed that the enormous wafer whichsealed it was still moist. The message could not have come from adistance. He read:&mdash;</p><p class="letter">M<small>Y</small> A<small>MIABLE</small> N<small>EIGHBOR</small>,Y<small>OUNG</small> M<small>AN</small>: I have learned of your goodness to me,that you paid my rent six months ago. I bless you, young man. My eldestdaughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for twodays, four persons and my spouse ill. If I am not deseaved in my opinion, Ithink I may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and thedesire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me aslight favor.<br/>    I am with the distinguished consideration which is due to thebenefactors of humanity,&mdash;</p><p class="right">J<small>ONDRETTE</small>.</p><p class="letter">P.S. My eldest daughter will await your orders, dear Monsieur Marius.</p><p>This letter, coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure whichhad occupied Marius&rsquo; thoughts ever since the preceding evening, was like acandle in a cellar. All was suddenly illuminated.</p><p>This letter came from the same place as the other four. There was the samewriting, the same style, the same orthography, the same paper, the sameodor of tobacco.</p><p>There were five missives, five histories, five signatures, and a singlesigner. The Spanish Captain Don Alvarès, the unhappy Mistress Balizard,the dramatic poet Genflot, the old comedian Fabantou, were all four namedJondrette, if, indeed, Jondrette himself were named Jondrette.</p><p>Marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time, and he had had,as we have said, but very rare occasion to see, to even catch a glimpseof, his extremely mean neighbors. His mind was elsewhere, and where themind is, there the eyes are also. He had been obliged more than once topass the Jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs; but they were mereforms to him; he had paid so little heed to them, that, on the precedingevening, he had jostled the Jondrette girls on the boulevard, withoutrecognizing them, for it had evidently been they, and it was with greatdifficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him,in spite of disgust and pity, a vague recollection of having met herelsewhere.</p><p>Now he saw everything clearly. He understood that his neighbor Jondrette,in his distress, exercised the industry of speculating on the charity ofbenevolent persons, that he procured addresses, and that he wrote underfeigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and compassionate,letters which his daughters delivered at their risk and peril, for thisfather had come to such a pass, that he risked his daughters; he wasplaying a game with fate, and he used them as the stake. Marius understoodthat probably, judging from their flight on the evening before, from theirbreathless condition, from their terror and from the words of slang whichhe had overheard, these unfortunate creatures were plying someinexplicably sad profession, and that the result of the whole was, in themidst of human society, as it is now constituted, two miserable beings whowere neither girls nor women, a species of impure and innocent monstersproduced by misery.</p><p>Sad creatures, without name, or sex, or age, to whom neither good nor evilwere any longer possible, and who, on emerging from childhood, havealready nothing in this world, neither liberty, nor virtue, norresponsibility. Souls which blossomed out yesterday, and are faded to-day,like those flowers let fall in the streets, which are soiled with everysort of mire, while waiting for some wheel to crush them. Nevertheless,while Marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her, the young girl waswandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity of a spectre. Shekicked about, without troubling herself as to her nakedness. Occasionallyher chemise, which was untied and torn, fell almost to her waist. Shemoved the chairs about, she disarranged the toilet articles which stood onthe commode, she handled Marius&rsquo; clothes, she rummaged about to see whatthere was in the corners.</p><p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you have a mirror!&rdquo;</p><p>And she hummed scraps of vaudevilles, as though she had been alone,frolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice renderedlugubrious.</p><p>An indescribable constraint, weariness, and humiliation were perceptiblebeneath this hardihood. Effrontery is a disgrace.</p><p>Nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room,and, so to speak, flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened bythe daylight, or which has broken its wing. One felt that under otherconditions of education and destiny, the gay and over-free mien of thisyoung girl might have turned out sweet and charming. Never, even amonganimals, does the creature born to be a dove change into an osprey. Thatis only to be seen among men.</p><p>Marius reflected, and allowed her to have her way.</p><p>She approached the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;books!&rdquo;</p><p>A flash pierced her glassy eye. She resumed, and her accent expressed thehappiness which she felt in boasting of something, to which no humancreature is insensible:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I know how to read, I do!&rdquo;</p><p>She eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table, and read withtolerable fluency:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;General Bauduin received orders to take the château of Hougomontwhich stands in the middle of the plain of Waterloo, with five battalionsof his brigade.&rdquo;</p><p>She paused.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Waterloo! I know about that. It was a battle long ago. My father wasthere. My father has served in the armies. We are fine Bonapartists in ourhouse, that we are! Waterloo was against the English.&rdquo;</p><p>She laid down the book, caught up a pen, and exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And I know how to write, too!&rdquo;</p><p>She dipped her pen in the ink, and turning to Marius:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to see? Look here, I&rsquo;m going to write a word to show you.&rdquo;</p><p>And before he had time to answer, she wrote on a sheet of white paper,which lay in the middle of the table: &ldquo;The bobbies are here.&rdquo;</p><p>Then throwing down the pen:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There are no faults of orthography. You can look. We have received aneducation, my sister and I. We have not always been as we are now. We werenot made&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Here she paused, fixed her dull eyes on Marius, and burst out laughing,saying, with an intonation which contained every form of anguish, stifledby every form of cynicism:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;</p><p>And she began to hum these words to a gay air:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;J&rsquo;ai faim, mon père.&rdquo;<br/>Pas de fricot.<br/>J&rsquo;ai froid, ma mère.<br/>Pas de tricot.<br/>    Grelotte,<br/>    Lolotte!<br/>    Sanglote,<br/>    Jacquot!&rdquo;<br/><br/>I am hungry, father.<br/>I have no food.<br/>I am cold, mother.<br/>I have no clothes.<br/>    Lolotte!<br/>    Shiver,<br/>    Sob,<br/>    Jacquot!&rdquo;</p><p>She had hardly finished this couplet, when she exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you ever go to the play, Monsieur Marius? I do. I have a littlebrother who is a friend of the artists, and who gives me ticketssometimes. But I don&rsquo;t like the benches in the galleries. One is crampedand uncomfortable there. There are rough people there sometimes; andpeople who smell bad.&rdquo;</p><p>Then she scrutinized Marius, assumed a singular air and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know, Mr. Marius, that you are a very handsome fellow?&rdquo;</p><p>And at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both, and made hersmile and him blush. She stepped up to him, and laid her hand on hisshoulder: &ldquo;You pay no heed to me, but I know you, Mr. Marius. I meet youhere on the staircase, and then I often see you going to a person namedFather Mabeuf who lives in the direction of Austerlitz, sometimes when Ihave been strolling in that quarter. It is very becoming to you to haveyour hair tumbled thus.&rdquo;</p><p>She tried to render her voice soft, but only succeeded in making it verydeep. A portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx toher lips, as though on a piano where some notes are missing.</p><p>Marius had retreated gently.</p><p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said he, with his cool gravity, &ldquo;I have here a packagewhich belongs to you, I think. Permit me to return it to you.&rdquo;</p><p>And he held out the envelope containing the four letters.</p><p>She clapped her hands and exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;We have been looking everywhere for that!&rdquo;</p><p>Then she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope, saying as shedid so:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Dieu de Dieu! how my sister and I have hunted! And it was you who foundit! On the boulevard, was it not? It must have been on the boulevard? Yousee, we let it fall when we were running. It was that brat of a sister ofmine who was so stupid. When we got home, we could not find it anywhere.As we did not wish to be beaten, as that is useless, as that is entirelyuseless, as that is absolutely useless, we said that we had carried theletters to the proper persons, and that they had said to us: &lsquo;Nix.&rsquo; Sohere they are, those poor letters! And how did you find out that theybelonged to me? Ah! yes, the writing. So it was you that we jostled as wepassed last night. We couldn&rsquo;t see. I said to my sister: &lsquo;Is it agentleman?&rsquo; My sister said to me: &lsquo;I think it is a gentleman.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>In the meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed to &ldquo;thebenevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;this is for that old fellow who goes to mass. By theway, this is his hour. I&rsquo;ll go and carry it to him. Perhaps he will giveus something to breakfast on.&rdquo;</p><p>Then she began to laugh again, and added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today? It will meanthat we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday, ourbreakfast of yesterday, our dinner of to-day, and all that at once, andthis morning. Come! Parbleu! if you are not satisfied, dogs, burst!&rdquo;</p><p>This reminded Marius of the wretched girl&rsquo;s errand to himself. He fumbledin his waistcoat pocket, and found nothing there.</p><p>The young girl went on, and seemed to have no consciousness of Marius&rsquo;presence.</p><p>&ldquo;I often go off in the evening. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t come home again. Lastwinter, before we came here, we lived under the arches of the bridges. Wehuddled together to keep from freezing. My little sister cried. Howmelancholy the water is! When I thought of drowning myself, I said tomyself: &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s too cold.&rsquo; I go out alone, whenever I choose, Isometimes sleep in the ditches. Do you know, at night, when I walk alongthe boulevard, I see the trees like forks, I see houses, all black and asbig as Notre Dame, I fancy that the white walls are the river, I say tomyself: &lsquo;Why, there&rsquo;s water there!&rsquo; The stars are like the lamps inilluminations, one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew themout, I am bewildered, as though horses were breathing in my ears; althoughit is night, I hear hand-organs and spinning-machines, and I don&rsquo;t knowwhat all. I think people are flinging stones at me, I flee without knowingwhither, everything whirls and whirls. You feel very queer when you havehad no food.&rdquo;</p><p>And then she stared at him with a bewildered air.</p><p>By dint of searching and ransacking his pockets, Marius had finallycollected five francs sixteen sous. This was all he owned in the world forthe moment. &ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;there is my dinner for to-day,and to-morrow we will see.&rdquo; He kept the sixteen sous, and handed the fivefrancs to the young girl.</p><p>She seized the coin.</p><p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the sun is shining!&rdquo;</p><p>And, as though the sun had possessed the property of melting theavalanches of slang in her brain, she went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Five francs! the shiner! a monarch! in this hole! Ain&rsquo;t this fine! You&rsquo;rea jolly thief! I&rsquo;m your humble servant! Bravo for the good fellows! Twodays&rsquo; wine! and meat! and stew! we&rsquo;ll have a royal feast! and a goodfill!&rdquo;</p><p>She pulled her chemise up on her shoulders, made a low bow to Marius, thena familiar sign with her hand, and went towards the door, saying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning, sir. It&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ll go and find my old man.&rdquo;</p><p>As she passed, she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode,which was moulding there amid the dust; she flung herself upon it and bitinto it, muttering:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good! it&rsquo;s hard! it breaks my teeth!&rdquo;</p><p>Then she departed.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0205" id="link2HCH0205"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;A PROVIDENTIAL PEEP-HOLE</h3><p>Marius had lived for five years in poverty, in destitution, even indistress, but he now perceived that he had not known real misery. Truemisery he had but just had a view of. It was its spectre which had justpassed before his eyes. In fact, he who has only beheld the misery of manhas seen nothing; the misery of woman is what he must see; he who has seenonly the misery of woman has seen nothing; he must see the misery of thechild.</p><p>When a man has reached his last extremity, he has reached his lastresources at the same time. Woe to the defenceless beings who surroundhim! Work, wages, bread, fire, courage, good will, all fail himsimultaneously. The light of day seems extinguished without, the morallight within; in these shadows man encounters the feebleness of the womanand the child, and bends them violently to ignominy.</p><p>Then all horrors become possible. Despair is surrounded with fragilepartitions which all open on either vice or crime.</p><p>Health, youth, honor, all the shy delicacies of the young body, the heart,virginity, modesty, that epidermis of the soul, are manipulated insinister wise by that fumbling which seeks resources, which encountersopprobrium, and which accommodates itself to it. Fathers, mothers,children, brothers, sisters, men, women, daughters, adhere and becomeincorporated, almost like a mineral formation, in that duskypromiscuousness of sexes, relationships, ages, infamies, and innocences.They crouch, back to back, in a sort of hut of fate. They exchangewoe-begone glances. Oh, the unfortunate wretches! How pale they are! Howcold they are! It seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further fromthe sun than ours.</p><p>This young girl was to Marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sadshadows. She revealed to him a hideous side of the night.</p><p>Marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of reverie andpassion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up tothat day. The payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement, whichany one would have yielded to; but he, Marius, should have done betterthan that. What! only a wall separated him from those abandoned beings wholived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest of the world, hewas elbow to elbow with them, he was, in some sort, the last link of thehuman race which they touched, he heard them live, or rather, rattle inthe death agony beside him, and he paid no heed to them! Every day, everyinstant, he heard them walking on the other side of the wall, he heardthem go, and come, and speak, and he did not even lend an ear! And groanslay in those words, and he did not even listen to them, his thoughts wereelsewhere, given up to dreams, to impossible radiances, to loves in theair, to follies; and all the while, human creatures, his brothers in JesusChrist, his brothers in the people, were agonizing in vain beside him! Heeven formed a part of their misfortune, and he aggravated it. For if theyhad had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive, anyordinary and charitable man, evidently their indigence would have beennoticed, their signals of distress would have been perceived, and theywould have been taken hold of and rescued! They appeared very corrupt andvery depraved, no doubt, very vile, very odious even; but those who fallwithout becoming degraded are rare; besides, there is a point where theunfortunate and the infamous unite and are confounded in a single word, afatal word, <i>the miserable</i>; whose fault is this? And then should notthe charity be all the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?</p><p>While reading himself this moral lesson, for there were occasions on whichMarius, like all truly honest hearts, was his own pedagogue and scoldedhimself more than he deserved, he stared at the wall which separated himfrom the Jondrettes, as though he were able to make his gaze, full ofpity, penetrate that partition and warm these wretched people. The wallwas a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams, and, as the readerhad just learned, it allowed the sound of voices and words to be clearlydistinguished. Only a man as dreamy as Marius could have failed toperceive this long before. There was no paper pasted on the wall, eitheron the side of the Jondrettes or on that of Marius; the coarseconstruction was visible in its nakedness. Marius examined the partition,almost unconsciously; sometimes reverie examines, observes, and scrutinizesas thought would. All at once he sprang up; he had just perceived, nearthe top, close to the ceiling, a triangular hole, which resulted from thespace between three lathes. The plaster which should have filled thiscavity was missing, and by mounting on the commode, a view could be hadthrough this aperture into the Jondrettes&rsquo; attic. Commiseration has, andshould have, its curiosity. This aperture formed a sort of peep-hole. Itis permissible to gaze at misfortune like a traitor in order to succor it.<ahref="#linknote-27" name="linknoteref-27" id="linknoteref-27">27</a></p><p>&ldquo;Let us get some little idea of what these people are like,&rdquo; thoughtMarius, &ldquo;and in what condition they are.&rdquo;</p><p>He climbed upon the commode, put his eye to the crevice, and looked.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0206" id="link2HCH0206"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE WILD MAN IN HIS LAIR</h3><p>Cities, like forests, have their caverns in which all the most wicked andformidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves. Only, incities, that which thus conceals itself is ferocious, unclean, and petty,that is to say, ugly; in forests, that which conceals itself is ferocious,savage, and grand, that is to say, beautiful. Taking one lair withanother, the beast&rsquo;s is preferable to the man&rsquo;s. Caverns are better thanhovels.</p><p>What Marius now beheld was a hovel.</p><p>Marius was poor, and his chamber was poverty-stricken, but as his povertywas noble, his garret was neat. The den upon which his eye now rested wasabject, dirty, fetid, pestiferous, mean, sordid. The only furnitureconsisted of a straw chair, an infirm table, some old bits of crockery,and in two of the corners, two indescribable pallets; all the light wasfurnished by a dormer window of four panes, draped with spiders&rsquo; webs.Through this aperture there penetrated just enough light to make the faceof a man appear like the face of a phantom. The walls had a leprousaspect, and were covered with seams and scars, like a visage disfigured bysome horrible malady; a repulsive moisture exuded from them. Obscenesketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be distinguished upon them.</p><p>The chamber which Marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement; thisone was neither tiled nor planked; its inhabitants stepped directly on theantique plaster of the hovel, which had grown black under thelong-continued pressure of feet. Upon this uneven floor, where the dirtseemed to be fairly incrusted, and which possessed but one virginity, thatof the broom, were capriciously grouped constellations of old shoes,socks, and repulsive rags; however, this room had a fireplace, so it waslet for forty francs a year. There was every sort of thing in thatfireplace, a brazier, a pot, broken boards, rags suspended from nails, abird-cage, ashes, and even a little fire. Two brands were smoulderingthere in a melancholy way.</p><p>One thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was, thatit was large. It had projections and angles and black holes, the lowersides of roofs, bays, and promontories. Hence horrible, unfathomable nookswhere it seemed as though spiders as big as one&rsquo;s fist, wood-lice as largeas one&rsquo;s foot, and perhaps even&mdash;who knows?&mdash;some monstroushuman beings, must be hiding.</p><p>One of the pallets was near the door, the other near the window. One end ofeach touched the fireplace and faced Marius. In a corner near the aperturethrough which Marius was gazing, a colored engraving in a black frame wassuspended to a nail on the wall, and at its bottom, in large letters, was theinscription: <small>THE DREAM</small>. This represented a sleeping woman, and achild, also asleep, the child on the woman&rsquo;s lap, an eagle in a cloud,with a crown in his beak, and the woman thrusting the crown away from thechild&rsquo;s head, without awaking the latter; in the background, Napoleon ina glory, leaning on a very blue column with a yellow capital ornamented withthis inscription:</p><p class="center">MARINGO<br/>AUSTERLITS<br/>IENA<br/>WAGRAMME<br/>ELOT</p><p class="noindent">Beneath this frame, a sort of wooden panel, which was no longer than itwas broad, stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude againstthe wall. It had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to thewall, of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side, of somepier-glass detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting tobe rehung.</p><p>Near the table, upon which Marius descried a pen, ink, and paper, sat aman about sixty years of age, small, thin, livid, haggard, with a cunning,cruel, and uneasy air; a hideous scoundrel.</p><p>If Lavater had studied this visage, he would have found the vulturemingled with the attorney there, the bird of prey and the pettifoggerrendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other; thepettifogger making the bird of prey ignoble, the bird of prey making thepettifogger horrible.</p><p>This man had a long gray beard. He was clad in a woman&rsquo;s chemise, whichallowed his hairy breast and his bare arms, bristling with gray hair, tobe seen. Beneath this chemise, muddy trousers and boots through which histoes projected were visible.</p><p>He had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking. There was no bread in thehovel, but there was still tobacco.</p><p>He was writing probably some more letters like those which Marius hadread.</p><p>On the corner of the table lay an ancient, dilapidated, reddish volume,and the size, which was the antique 12mo of reading-rooms, betrayed aromance. On the cover sprawled the following title, printed in largecapitals:</p><p class="center">GOD; THE KING; HONOR AND THE LADIES;<br/>by<br/><small>DUCRAY DUMINIL</small>,<br/>1814.<br/></p><p>As the man wrote, he talked aloud, and Marius heard his words:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The idea that there is no equality, even when you are dead! Just look atPère-Lachaise! The great, those who are rich, are up above, in the acaciaalley, which is paved. They can reach it in a carriage. The little people,the poor, the unhappy, well, what of them? they are put down below, wherethe mud is up to your knees, in the damp places. They are put there sothat they will decay the sooner! You cannot go to see them without sinkinginto the earth.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused, smote the table with his fist, and added, as he ground histeeth:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! I could eat the whole world!&rdquo;</p><p>A big woman, who might be forty years of age, or a hundred, was crouchingnear the fireplace on her bare heels.</p><p>She, too, was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patched withbits of old cloth. A coarse linen apron concealed the half of herpetticoat. Although this woman was doubled up and bent together, it couldbe seen that she was of very lofty stature. She was a sort of giant,beside her husband. She had hideous hair, of a reddish blond which wasturning gray, and which she thrust back from time to time, with herenormous shining hands, with their flat nails.</p><p>Beside her, on the floor, wide open, lay a book of the same form as theother, and probably a volume of the same romance.</p><p>On one of the pallets, Marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall paleyoung girl, who sat there half naked and with pendant feet, and who didnot seem to be listening or seeing or living.</p><p>No doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room.</p><p>She seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age. On closer scrutiny it wasevident that she really was fourteen. She was the child who had said, onthe boulevard the evening before: &ldquo;I bolted, bolted, bolted!&rdquo;</p><p>She was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time, thensuddenly starts up rapidly. It is indigence which produces thesemelancholy human plants. These creatures have neither childhood nor youth.At fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve, at sixteen they seemtwenty. To-day a little girl, to-morrow a woman. One might say that theystride through life, in order to get through with it the more speedily.</p><p>At this moment, this being had the air of a child.</p><p>Moreover, no trace of work was revealed in that dwelling; no handicraft,no spinning-wheel, not a tool. In one corner lay some ironmongery ofdubious aspect. It was the dull listlessness which follows despair andprecedes the death agony.</p><p>Marius gazed for a while at this gloomy interior, more terrifying than theinterior of a tomb, for the human soul could be felt fluttering there, andlife was palpitating there. The garret, the cellar, the lowly ditch wherecertain indigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of the social edifice,is not exactly the sepulchre, but only its antechamber; but, as thewealthy display their greatest magnificence at the entrance of theirpalaces, it seems that death, which stands directly side by side withthem, places its greatest miseries in that vestibule.</p><p>The man held his peace, the woman spoke no word, the young girl did noteven seem to breathe. The scratching of the pen on the paper was audible.</p><p>The man grumbled, without pausing in his writing. &ldquo;Canaille! canaille!everybody is canaille!&rdquo;</p><p>This variation to Solomon&rsquo;s exclamation elicited a sigh from the woman.</p><p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, my little friend,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt yourself, mydear. You are too good to write to all those people, husband.&rdquo;</p><p>Bodies press close to each other in misery, as in cold, but hearts drawapart. This woman must have loved this man, to all appearance, judgingfrom the amount of love within her; but probably, in the daily andreciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on the wholegroup, this had become extinct. There no longer existed in her anythingmore than the ashes of affection for her husband. Nevertheless, caressingappellations had survived, as is often the case. She called him: <i>Mydear, my little friend, my good man</i>, etc., with her mouth while herheart was silent.</p><p>The man resumed his writing.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0207" id="link2HCH0207"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;STRATEGY AND TACTICS</h3><p>Marius, with a load upon his breast, was on the point of descending fromthe species of observatory which he had improvised, when a sound attractedhis attention and caused him to remain at his post.</p><p>The door of the attic had just burst open abruptly. The eldest girl madeher appearance on the threshold. On her feet, she had large, coarse, men&rsquo;sshoes, bespattered with mud, which had splashed even to her red ankles,and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters. Marius had notseen it on her an hour previously, but she had probably deposited it athis door, in order that she might inspire the more pity, and had picked itup again on emerging. She entered, pushed the door to behind her, pausedto take breath, for she was completely breathless, then exclaimed with anexpression of triumph and joy:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;He is coming!&rdquo;</p><p>The father turned his eyes towards her, the woman turned her head, thelittle sister did not stir.</p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded her father.</p><p>&ldquo;The gentleman!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The philanthropist?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;From the church of Saint-Jacques?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That old fellow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And he is coming?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is following me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There, truly, he is coming?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is coming in a fiacre.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In a fiacre.

What did he say to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ta, ta, ta,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;how you do gallop on, my good man! See here:I entered the church, he was in his usual place, I made him a reverence,and I handed him the letter; he read it and said to me: &lsquo;Where do youlive, my child?&rsquo; I said: &lsquo;Monsieur, I will show you.&rsquo; He said to me: &lsquo;No,give me your address, my daughter has some purchases to make, I will takea carriage and reach your house at the same time that you do.&rsquo; I gave himthe address. When I mentioned the house, he seemed surprised and hesitatedfor an instant, then he said: &lsquo;Never mind, I will come.&rsquo; When the mass wasfinished, I watched him leave the church with his daughter, and I saw thementer a carriage. I certainly did tell him the last door in the corridor,on the right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what makes you think that he will come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have just seen the fiacre turn into the Rue Petit-Banquier. That iswhat made me run so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you know that it was the same fiacre?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I took notice of the number, so there!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What was the number?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;440.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good, you are a clever girl.&rdquo;</p><p>The girl stared boldly at her father, and showing the shoes which she hadon her feet:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;A clever girl, possibly; but I tell you I won&rsquo;t put these shoes on again,and that I won&rsquo;t, for the sake of my health, in the first place, and forthe sake of cleanliness, in the next. I don&rsquo;t know anything moreirritating than shoes that squelch, and go <i>ghi, ghi, ghi,</i> the wholetime. I prefer to go barefoot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said her father, in a sweet tone which contrasted withthe young girl&rsquo;s rudeness, &ldquo;but then, you will not be allowed to enterchurches, for poor people must have shoes to do that. One cannot gobarefoot to the good God,&rdquo; he added bitterly.</p><p>Then, returning to the subject which absorbed him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;So you are sure that he will come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is following on my heels,&rdquo; said she.</p><p>The man started up. A sort of illumination appeared on his countenance.</p><p>&ldquo;Wife!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you hear. Here is the philanthropist. Extinguishthe fire.&rdquo;</p><p>The stupefied mother did not stir.</p><p>The father, with the agility of an acrobat, seized a broken-nosed jugwhich stood on the chimney, and flung the water on the brands.</p><p>Then, addressing his eldest daughter:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Here you! Pull the straw off that chair!&rdquo;</p><p>His daughter did not understand.</p><p>He seized the chair, and with one kick he rendered it seatless. His legpassed through it.</p><p>As he withdrew his leg, he asked his daughter:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it cold?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very cold. It is snowing.&rdquo;</p><p>The father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near thewindow, and shouted to her in a thundering voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Quick! get off that bed, you lazy thing! will you never do anything?Break a pane of glass!&rdquo;</p><p>The little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver.</p><p>&ldquo;Break a pane!&rdquo; he repeated.</p><p>The child stood still in bewilderment.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you hear me?&rdquo; repeated her father, &ldquo;I tell you to break a pane!&rdquo;</p><p>The child, with a sort of terrified obedience, rose on tiptoe, and strucka pane with her fist. The glass broke and fell with a loud clatter.</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the father.</p><p>He was grave and abrupt. His glance swept rapidly over all the crannies ofthe garret. One would have said that he was a general making the finalpreparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of beginning.</p><p>The mother, who had not said a word so far, now rose and demanded in adull, slow, languid voice, whence her words seemed to emerge in acongealed state:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do, my dear?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get into bed,&rdquo; replied the man.</p><p>His intonation admitted of no deliberation. The mother obeyed, and threwherself heavily on one of the pallets.</p><p>In the meantime, a sob became audible in one corner.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried the father.</p><p>The younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist, without quitting thecorner in which she was cowering. She had wounded herself while breakingthe window; she went off, near her mother&rsquo;s pallet and wept silently.</p><p>It was now the mother&rsquo;s turn to start up and exclaim:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Just see there! What follies you commit! She has cut herself breakingthat pane for you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So much the better!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;I foresaw that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? So much the better?&rdquo; retorted his wife.</p><p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; replied the father, &ldquo;I suppress the liberty of the press.&rdquo;</p><p>Then tearing the woman&rsquo;s chemise which he was wearing, he made a strip ofcloth with which he hastily swathed the little girl&rsquo;s bleeding wrist.</p><p>That done, his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his torn chemise.</p><p>&ldquo;And the chemise too,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this has a good appearance.&rdquo;</p><p>An icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room. The outermist penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheet ofwadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers. Through the broken pane thesnow could be seen falling. The snow promised by the Candlemas sun of thepreceding day had actually come.</p><p>The father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he hadforgotten nothing. He seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wetbrands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them.</p><p>Then drawing himself up and leaning against the chimney-piece:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we can receive the philanthropist.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0208" id="link2HCH0208"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE RAY OF LIGHT IN THE HOVEL</h3><p>The big girl approached and laid her hand in her father&rsquo;s.</p><p>&ldquo;Feel how cold I am,&rdquo; said she.</p><p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; replied the father, &ldquo;I am much colder than that.&rdquo;</p><p>The mother exclaimed impetuously:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You always have something better than any one else, so you do! even badthings.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Down with you!&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>The mother, being eyed after a certain fashion, held her tongue.</p><p>Silence reigned for a moment in the hovel.

The two newcomers advanced,therefore, with a certain hesitation, being hardly able to distinguish thevague forms surrounding them, while they could be clearly seen andscrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the garret, who wereaccustomed to this twilight.</p><p>M. Leblanc approached, with his sad but kindly look, and said to Jondrettethe father:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur, in this package you will find some new clothes and some woollenstockings and blankets.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Our angelic benefactor overwhelms us,&rdquo; said Jondrette, bowing to the veryearth.</p><p>Then, bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter, while the twovisitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior, he added in alow and rapid voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey? What did I say? Duds! No money! They are all alike! By the way, howwas the letter to that old blockhead signed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fabantou,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p><p>&ldquo;The dramatic artist, good!&rdquo;</p><p>It was lucky for Jondrette, that this had occurred to him, for at the verymoment, M.

I remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dramatic artist, sir, and one who has had some success.&rdquo;</p><p>Here Jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the&ldquo;philanthropist.&rdquo; He exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the sametime of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs, and the humility of themendicant on the highway:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;A pupil of Talma! Sir! I am a pupil of Talma! Fortune formerly smiled onme&mdash;Alas! Now it is misfortune&rsquo;s turn. You see, my benefactor, nobread, no fire. My poor babes have no fire!

Leblanc.</p><p>&ldquo;My child wounded!&rdquo; added Jondrette.</p><p>The child, diverted by the arrival of the strangers, had fallen tocontemplating &ldquo;the young lady,&rdquo; and had ceased to sob.</p><p>&ldquo;Cry! bawl!&rdquo; said Jondrette to her in a low voice.</p><p>At the same time he pinched her sore hand. All this was done with thetalent of a juggler.</p><p>The little girl gave vent to loud shrieks.</p><p>The adorable young girl, whom Marius, in his heart, called &ldquo;his Ursule,&rdquo; approached her hastily.</p><p>&ldquo;Poor, dear child!&rdquo; said she.</p><p>&ldquo;You see, my beautiful young lady,&rdquo; pursued Jondrette &ldquo;her bleeding wrist!It came through an accident while working at a machine to earn six sous aday. It may be necessary to cut off her arm.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said the old gentleman, in alarm.</p><p>The little girl, taking this seriously, fell to sobbing more violentlythan ever.</p><p>&ldquo;Alas! yes, my benefactor!&rdquo; replied the father.</p><p>For several minutes, Jondrette had been scrutinizing &ldquo;the benefactor&rdquo; in asingular fashion. As he spoke, he seemed to be examining the otherattentively, as though seeking to summon up his recollections. All atonce, profiting by a moment when the newcomers were questioning the childwith interest as to her injured hand, he passed near his wife, who lay inher bed with a stupid and dejected air, and said to her in a rapid butvery low tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Take a look at that man!&rdquo;</p><p>Then, turning to M. Leblanc, and continuing his lamentations:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You see, sir! All the clothing that I have is my wife&rsquo;s chemise! And alltorn at that! In the depths of winter! I can&rsquo;t go out for lack of a coat.If I had a coat of any sort, I would go and see Mademoiselle Mars, whoknows me and is very fond of me.

Elmire wouldbestow alms on Bélisaire! But no, nothing! And not a sou in the house! Mywife ill, and not a sou! My daughter dangerously injured, not a sou! Mywife suffers from fits of suffocation. It comes from her age, and besides,her nervous system is affected. She ought to have assistance, and mydaughter also! But the doctor! But the apothecary! How am I to pay them? Iwould kneel to a penny, sir! Such is the condition to which the arts arereduced. And do you know, my charming young lady, and you, my generousprotector, do you know, you who breathe forth virtue and goodness, and whoperfume that church where my daughter sees you every day when she says herprayers?&mdash;For I have brought up my children religiously, sir. I didnot want them to take to the theatre. Ah! the hussies! If I catch themtripping! I do not jest, that I don&rsquo;t! I read them lessons on honor, onmorality, on virtue! Ask them! They have got to walk straight. They arenone of your unhappy wretches who begin by having no family, and end byespousing the public. One is Mamselle Nobody, and one becomes MadameEverybody. Deuce take it! None of that in the Fabantou family! I mean tobring them up virtuously, and they shall be honest, and nice, and believein God, by the sacred name!

There, sir. I owe for four quarters&mdash;awhole year! that is to say, sixty francs.&rdquo;</p><p>Jondrette lied. Four quarters would have amounted to only forty francs,and he could not owe four, because six months had not elapsed since Mariushad paid for two.</p><p>M.

What does he think I can do with his five francs? Thatwon&rsquo;t pay me for my chair and pane of glass! That&rsquo;s what comes ofincurring expenses!&rdquo;</p><p>In the meanwhile, M. Leblanc had removed the large brown great-coat whichhe wore over his blue coat, and had thrown it over the back of the chair.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Fabantou,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;these five francs are all that I have aboutme, but I shall now take my daughter home, and I will return this evening,&mdash;itis this evening that you must pay, is it not?&rdquo;</p><p>Jondrette&rsquo;s face lighted up with a strange expression.

And he added, in a lowtone: &ldquo;Take a good look at him, wife!&rdquo;</p><p>M. Leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl, once more, and had turnedtowards the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Farewell until this evening, my friends!&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo; said Jondrette.</p><p>&ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock precisely.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of theelder Jondrette girl.</p><p>&ldquo;You are forgetting your coat, sir,&rdquo; said she.</p><p>Jondrette darted an annihilating look at his daughter, accompanied by aformidable shrug of the shoulders.</p><p>M. Leblanc turned back and said, with a smile:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have not forgotten it, I am leaving it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;O my protector!&rdquo; said Jondrette, &ldquo;my august benefactor, I melt intotears! Permit me to accompany you to your carriage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If you come out,&rdquo; answered M. Leblanc, &ldquo;put on this coat.

His eyes had remained fixed on the young girl, his hearthad, so to speak, seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment ofher very first step in that garret. During her entire stay there, he hadlived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions andprecipitates the whole soul on a single point. He contemplated, not thatgirl, but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet. Thestar Sirius might have entered the room, and he would not have been anymore dazzled.</p><p>While the young girl was engaged in opening the package, unfolding theclothing and the blankets, questioning the sick mother kindly, and thelittle injured girl tenderly, he watched her every movement, he sought tocatch her words. He knew her eyes, her brow, her beauty, her form, herwalk, he did not know the sound of her voice. He had once fancied that hehad caught a few words at the Luxembourg, but he was not absolutely sureof the fact. He would have given ten years of his life to hear it, inorder that he might bear away in his soul a little of that music. Buteverything was drowned in the lamentable exclamations and trumpet burstsof Jondrette. This added a touch of genuine wrath to Marius&rsquo; ecstasy. Hedevoured her with his eyes. He could not believe that it really was thatdivine creature whom he saw in the midst of those vile creatures in thatmonstrous lair. It seemed to him that he beheld a humming-bird in themidst of toads.</p><p>When she took her departure, he had but one thought, to follow her, tocling to her trace, not to quit her until he learned where she lived, notto lose her again, at least, after having so miraculously re-discoveredher. He leaped down from the commode and seized his hat. As he laid hishand on the lock of the door, and was on the point of opening it, a suddenreflection caused him to pause. The corridor was long, the staircasesteep, Jondrette was talkative, M. Leblanc had, no doubt, not yet regainedhis carriage; if, on turning round in the corridor, or on the staircase,he were to catch sight of him, Marius, in that house, he would, evidently,take the alarm, and find means to escape from him again, and this time itwould be final. What was he to do? Should he wait a little? But while hewas waiting, the carriage might drive off. Marius was perplexed. At lasthe accepted the risk and quitted his room.</p><p>There was no one in the corridor. He hastened to the stairs. There was noone on the staircase. He descended in all haste, and reached the boulevardin time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier,on its way back to Paris.</p><p>Marius rushed headlong in that direction. On arriving at the angle of theboulevard, he caught sight of the fiacre again, rapidly descending the RueMouffetard; the carriage was already a long way off, and there was nomeans of overtaking it; what! run after it? Impossible; and besides, thepeople in the carriage would assuredly notice an individual running atfull speed in pursuit of a fiacre, and the father would recognize him. Atthat moment, wonderful and unprecedented good luck, Marius perceived anempty cab passing along the boulevard. There was but one thing to be done,to jump into this cab and follow the fiacre. That was sure, efficacious,and free from danger.</p><p>Marius made the driver a sign to halt, and called to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;By the hour?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius wore no cravat, he had on his working-coat, which was destitute ofbuttons, his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom.</p><p>The driver halted, winked, and held out his left hand to Marius, rubbinghis forefinger gently with his thumb.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Pay in advance,&rdquo; said the coachman.</p><p>Marius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him.</p><p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; he demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;Forty sous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will pay on my return.&rdquo;</p><p>The driver&rsquo;s only reply was to whistle the air of La Palisse and to whipup his horse.</p><p>Marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air. For thelack of four and twenty sous, he was losing his joy, his happiness, hislove! He had seen, and he was becoming blind again. He reflected bitterly,and it must be confessed, with profound regret, on the five francs whichhe had bestowed, that very morning, on that miserable girl. If he had hadthose five francs, he would have been saved, he would have been bornagain, he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness, he would havemade his escape from isolation and spleen, from his widowed state; hemight have re-knotted the black thread of his destiny to that beautifulgolden thread, which had just floated before his eyes and had broken atthe same instant, once more! He returned to his hovel in despair.</p><p>He might have told himself that M. Leblanc had promised to return in theevening, and that all he had to do was to set about the matter moreskilfully, so that he might follow him on that occasion; but, in hiscontemplation, it is doubtful whether he had heard this.</p><p>As he was on the point of mounting the staircase, he perceived, on theother side of the boulevard, near the deserted wall skirting the Rue De laBarrière-des-Gobelins, Jondrette, wrapped in the &ldquo;philanthropist&rsquo;s&rdquo; great-coat, engaged in conversation with one of those men of disquietingaspect who have been dubbed by common consent, <i>prowlers of the barriers</i>;people of equivocal face, of suspicious monologues, who present the air ofhaving evil minds, and who generally sleep in the daytime, which suggeststhe supposition that they work by night.</p><p>These two men, standing there motionless and in conversation, in the snowwhich was falling in whirlwinds, formed a group that a policeman wouldsurely have observed, but which Marius hardly noticed.</p><p>Still, in spite of his mournful preoccupation, he could not refrain fromsaying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom Jondrettewas talking resembled a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, aliasBigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a verydangerous nocturnal roamer. This man&rsquo;s name the reader has learned in thepreceding book. This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille,figured later on in many criminal trials, and became a notorious rascal.He was at that time only a famous rascal. To-day he exists in the state oftradition among ruffians and assassins. He was at the head of a schooltowards the end of the last reign. And in the evening, at nightfall, atthe hour when groups form and talk in whispers, he was discussed at LaForce in the Fosse-aux-Lions. One might even, in that prison, precisely atthe spot where the sewer which served the unprecedented escape, in broaddaylight, of thirty prisoners, in 1843, passes under the culvert, read hisname, PANCHAUD, audaciously carved by his own hand on the wall of thesewer, during one of his attempts at flight. In 1832, the police alreadyhad their eye on him, but he had not as yet made a serious beginning.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0211" id="link2HCH0211"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;OFFERS OF SERVICE FROM MISERY TO WRETCHEDNESS</h3><p>Marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps; at the momentwhen he was about to re-enter his cell, he caught sight of the elderJondrette girl following him through the corridor. The very sight of thisgirl was odious to him; it was she who had his five francs, it was toolate to demand them back, the cab was no longer there, the fiacre was faraway. Moreover, she would not have given them back. As for questioning herabout the residence of the persons who had just been there, that wasuseless; it was evident that she did not know, since the letter signedFabantou had been addressed &ldquo;to the benevolent gentleman of the church ofSaint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him.</p><p>It did not close; he turned round and beheld a hand which held the doorhalf open.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;who is there?&rdquo;</p><p>It was the Jondrette girl.</p><p>&ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo; resumed Marius almost harshly, &ldquo;still you! What do you wantwith me?&rdquo;</p><p>She appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him. She no longer hadthe air of assurance which had characterized her that morning. She did notenter, but held back in the darkness of the corridor, where Marius couldsee her through the half-open door.</p><p>&ldquo;Come now, will you answer?&rdquo; cried Marius. &ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo;</p><p>She raised her dull eyes, in which a sort of gleam seemed to flickervaguely, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Marius, you look sad. What is the matter with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With me!&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is nothing the matter with me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, there is!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I tell you there is!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me alone!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius gave the door another push, but she retained her hold on it.</p><p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you are in the wrong. Although you are not rich, youwere kind this morning. Be so again now. You gave me something to eat, nowtell me what ails you. You are grieved, that is plain. I do not want youto be grieved. What can be done for it? Can I be of any service? Employme. I do not ask for your secrets, you need not tell them to me, but I maybe of use, nevertheless. I may be able to help you, since I help myfather. When it is necessary to carry letters, to go to houses, to inquirefrom door to door, to find out an address, to follow any one, I am ofservice. Well, you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with you, andI will go and speak to the persons; sometimes it is enough if some onespeaks to the persons, that suffices to let them understand matters, andeverything comes right. Make use of me.&rdquo;</p><p>An idea flashed across Marius&rsquo; mind. What branch does one disdain when onefeels that one is falling?</p><p>He drew near to the Jondrette girl.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen&mdash;&rdquo; he said to her.</p><p>She interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yes, do call me <i>thou!</i> I like that better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;thou hast brought hither that old gentleman and hisdaughter!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dost thou know their address?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Find it for me.&rdquo;</p><p>The Jondrette&rsquo;s dull eyes had grown joyous, and they now became gloomy.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that what you want?&rdquo; she demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is to say,&rdquo; she resumed quickly, &ldquo;you do not know her, but you wishto know her.&rdquo;</p><p>This <i>them</i> which had turned into <i>her</i> had somethingindescribably significant and bitter about it.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, can you do it?&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;You shall have the beautiful lady&rsquo;s address.&rdquo;</p><p>There was still a shade in the words &ldquo;the beautiful lady&rdquo; which troubledMarius. He resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind, after all, the address of the father and daughter. Theiraddress, indeed!&rdquo;</p><p>She gazed fixedly at him.</p><p>&ldquo;What will you give me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything you like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything I like?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You shall have the address.&rdquo;</p><p>She dropped her head; then, with a brusque movement, she pulled to thedoor, which closed behind her.</p><p>Marius found himself alone.</p><p>He dropped into a chair, with his head and both elbows on his bed,absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp, and as though a prey tovertigo. All that had taken place since the morning, the appearance of theangel, her disappearance, what that creature had just said to him, a gleamof hope floating in an immense despair,&mdash;this was what filled hisbrain confusedly.</p><p>All at once he was violently aroused from his reverie.</p><p>He heard the shrill, hard voice of Jondrette utter these words, which werefraught with a strange interest for him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I tell you that I am sure of it, and that I recognized him.&rdquo;</p><p>Of whom was Jondrette speaking? Whom had he recognized? M. Leblanc? Thefather of &ldquo;his Ursule&rdquo;? What! Did Jondrette know him? Was Marius about toobtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information withoutwhich his life was so dark to him? Was he about to learn at last who itwas that he loved, who that young girl was? Who her father was? Was thedense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being dispelled? Was theveil about to be rent? Ah! Heavens!</p><p>He bounded rather than climbed upon his commode, and resumed his post nearthe little peep-hole in the partition wall.</p><p>Again he beheld the interior of Jondrette&rsquo;s hovel.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0212" id="link2HCH0212"></a>CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE USE MADE OF M. LEBLANC&rsquo;S FIVE-FRANC PIECE</h3><p>Nothing in the aspect of the family was altered, except that the wife anddaughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings andjackets. Two new blankets were thrown across the two beds.</p><p>Jondrette had evidently just returned. He still had the breathlessness ofout of doors. His daughters were seated on the floor near the fireplace,the elder engaged in dressing the younger&rsquo;s wounded hand. His wife hadsunk back on the bed near the fireplace, with a face indicative ofastonishment. Jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with longstrides. His eyes were extraordinary.</p><p>The woman, who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence ofher husband, turned to say:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What, really? You are sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure! Eight years have passed! But I recognize him! Ah! I recognize him.I knew him at once! What! Didn&rsquo;t it force itself on you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I told you: &lsquo;Pay attention!&rsquo; Why, it is his figure, it is his face,only older,&mdash;there are people who do not grow old, I don&rsquo;t know howthey manage it,&mdash;it is the very sound of his voice. He is betterdressed, that is all! Ah! you mysterious old devil, I&rsquo;ve got you, that Ihave!&rdquo;</p><p>He paused, and said to his daughters:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Get out of here, you!&mdash;It&rsquo;s queer that it didn&rsquo;t strike you!&rdquo;</p><p>They arose to obey.</p><p>The mother stammered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;With her injured hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The air will do it good,&rdquo; said Jondrette. &ldquo;Be off.&rdquo;</p><p>It was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to reply.The two girls departed.</p><p>At the moment when they were about to pass through the door, the fatherdetained the elder by the arm, and said to her with a peculiar accent:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You will be here at five o&rsquo;clock precisely. Both of you. I shall needyou.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius redoubled his attention.</p><p>On being left alone with his wife, Jondrette began to pace the room again,and made the tour of it two or three times in silence. Then he spentseveral minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman&rsquo;s chemise which hewore into his trousers.</p><p>All at once, he turned to the female Jondrette, folded his arms andexclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And would you like to have me tell you something? The young lady&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo; retorted his wife, &ldquo;the young lady?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were speaking.He listened with ardent anxiety. His whole life was in his ears.</p><p>But Jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper. Then hestraightened himself up and concluded aloud:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It is she!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That one?&rdquo; said his wife.</p><p>&ldquo;That very one,&rdquo; said the husband.</p><p>No expression can reproduce the significance of the mother&rsquo;s words.Surprise, rage, hate, wrath, were mingled and combined in one monstrousintonation. The pronunciation of a few words, the name, no doubt, whichher husband had whispered in her ear, had sufficed to rouse this huge,somnolent woman, and from being repulsive she became terrible.</p><p>&ldquo;It is not possible!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;When I think that my daughters are goingbarefoot, and have not a gown to their backs! What! A satin pelisse, avelvet bonnet, boots, and everything; more than two hundred francs&rsquo; worthof clothes! so that one would think she was a lady! No, you are mistaken!Why, in the first place, the other was hideous, and this one is not sobad-looking! She really is not bad-looking! It can&rsquo;t be she!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I tell you that it is she. You will see.&rdquo;</p><p>At this absolute assertion, the Jondrette woman raised her large, red,blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression. At thatmoment, she seemed to Marius even more to be feared than her husband. Shewas a sow with the look of a tigress.</p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;that horrible, beautiful young lady, who gazed at mydaughters with an air of pity,&mdash;she is that beggar brat! Oh! I shouldlike to kick her stomach in for her!&rdquo;</p><p>She sprang off of the bed, and remained standing for a moment, her hair indisorder, her nostrils dilating, her mouth half open, her fists clenchedand drawn back. Then she fell back on the bed once more. The man paced toand fro and paid no attention to his female.</p><p>After a silence lasting several minutes, he approached the femaleJondrette, and halted in front of her, with folded arms, as he had done amoment before:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And shall I tell you another thing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>He answered in a low, curt voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My fortune is made.&rdquo;</p><p>The woman stared at him with the look that signifies: &ldquo;Is the person whois addressing me on the point of going mad?&rdquo;</p><p>He went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Thunder! It was not so very long ago that I was a parishioner of theparish of die-of-hunger-if-you-have-a-fire,-die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread!I have had enough of misery! my share and other people&rsquo;s share! I am notjoking any longer, I don&rsquo;t find it comic any more, I&rsquo;ve had enough ofpuns, good God! no more farces, Eternal Father! I want to eat till I amfull, I want to drink my fill! to gormandize! to sleep! to do nothing! Iwant to have my turn, so I do, come now! before I die! I want to be a bitof a millionnaire!&rdquo;</p><p>He took a turn round the hovel, and added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Like other people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked the woman.</p><p>He shook his head, winked, screwed up one eye, and raised his voice like amedical professor who is about to make a demonstration:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What do I mean by that? Listen!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; muttered the woman, &ldquo;not so loud! These are matters which must notbe overheard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bah! Who&rsquo;s here? Our neighbor? I saw him go out a little while ago.Besides, he doesn&rsquo;t listen, the big booby. And I tell you that I saw himgo out.&rdquo;</p><p>Nevertheless, by a sort of instinct, Jondrette lowered his voice, althoughnot sufficiently to prevent Marius hearing his words. One favorablecircumstance, which enabled Marius not to lose a word of this conversationwas the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on theboulevard.</p><p>This is what Marius heard:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen carefully. The Crœsus is caught, or as good as caught! That&rsquo;s allsettled already. Everything is arranged. I have seen some people. He willcome here this evening at six o&rsquo;clock. To bring sixty francs, the rascal!Did you notice how I played that game on him, my sixty francs, mylandlord, my fourth of February? I don&rsquo;t even owe for one quarter! Isn&rsquo;the a fool! So he will come at six o&rsquo;clock! That&rsquo;s the hour when ourneighbor goes to his dinner. Mother Bougon is off washing dishes in thecity. There&rsquo;s not a soul in the house. The neighbor never comes home untileleven o&rsquo;clock. The children shall stand on watch. You shall help us. Hewill give in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what if he does not give in?&rdquo; demanded his wife.</p><p>Jondrette made a sinister gesture, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix him.&rdquo;</p><p>And he burst out laughing.</p><p>This was the first time Marius had seen him laugh. The laugh was cold andsweet, and provoked a shudder.</p><p>Jondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace, and drew from it an oldcap, which he placed on his head, after brushing it with his sleeve.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out. I have some more people that I must see.Good ones. You&rsquo;ll see how well the whole thing will work. I shall be awayas short a time as possible, it&rsquo;s a fine stroke of business, do you lookafter the house.&rdquo;</p><p>And with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers, he stood fora moment in thought, then exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know, it&rsquo;s mighty lucky, by the way, that he didn&rsquo;t recognize me!If he had recognized me on his side, he would not have come back again. Hewould have slipped through our fingers! It was my beard that saved us! myromantic beard! my pretty little romantic beard!&rdquo;</p><p>And again he broke into a laugh.</p><p>He stepped to the window. The snow was still falling, and streaking thegray of the sky.</p><p>&ldquo;What beastly weather!&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Then lapping his overcoat across his breast:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;This rind is too large for me. Never mind,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;he did a devilishgood thing in leaving it for me, the old scoundrel! If it hadn&rsquo;t been forthat, I couldn&rsquo;t have gone out, and everything would have gone wrong! Whatsmall points things hang on, anyway!&rdquo;</p><p>And pulling his cap down over his eyes, he quitted the room.</p><p>He had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door, when thedoor opened again, and his savage but intelligent face made its appearanceonce more in the opening.</p><p>&ldquo;I came near forgetting,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You are to have a brazier of charcoalready.&rdquo;</p><p>And he flung into his wife&rsquo;s apron the five-franc piece which the&ldquo;philanthropist&rdquo; had left with him.</p><p>&ldquo;A brazier of charcoal?&rdquo; asked his wife.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How many bushels?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two good ones.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That will come to thirty sous. With the rest I will buy something fordinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The devil, no.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go and spend the hundred-sou piece.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I shall have to buy something, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How much shall you need?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmonger&rsquo;s shop?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rue Mouffetard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! yes, at the corner of a street; I can see the shop.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fifty sous&mdash;three francs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be much left for dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eating is not the point to-day. There&rsquo;s something better to be done.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, my jewel.&rdquo;</p><p>At this word from his wife, Jondrette closed the door again, and thistime, Marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel, anddescend the staircase rapidly.</p><p>At that moment, one o&rsquo;clock struck from the church of Saint-Médard.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0213" id="link2HCH0213"></a>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;SOLUS CUM SOLO, IN LOCO REMOTO, NON COGITABUNTUR ORAREPATER NOSTER</h3><p>Marius, dreamer as he was, was, as we have said, firm and energetic bynature. His habits of solitary meditation, while they had developed in himsympathy and compassion, had, perhaps, diminished the faculty forirritation, but had left intact the power of waxing indignant; he had thekindliness of a brahmin, and the severity of a judge; he took pity upon atoad, but he crushed a viper. Now, it was into a hole of vipers that hisglance had just been directed, it was a nest of monsters that he hadbeneath his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;These wretches must be stamped upon,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had beenelucidated; on the contrary, all of them had been rendered more dense, ifanything; he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of theLuxembourg and the man whom he called M. Leblanc, except that Jondrettewas acquainted with them. Athwart the mysterious words which had beenuttered, the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the factthat an ambush was in course of preparation, a dark but terrible trap;that both of them were incurring great danger, she probably, her fathercertainly; that they must be saved; that the hideous plots of theJondrettes must be thwarted, and the web of these spiders broken.</p><p>He scanned the female Jondrette for a moment. She had pulled an oldsheet-iron stove from a corner, and she was rummaging among the old heapof iron.</p><p>He descended from the commode as softly as possible, taking care not tomake the least noise. Amid his terror as to what was in preparation, andin the horror with which the Jondrettes had inspired him, he experienced asort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to rendera service to the one whom he loved.</p><p>But how was it to be done? How warn the persons threatened? He did notknow their address. They had reappeared for an instant before his eyes,and had then plunged back again into the immense depths of Paris. Shouldhe wait for M. Leblanc at the door that evening at six o&rsquo;clock, at themoment of his arrival, and warn him of the trap? But Jondrette and his menwould see him on the watch, the spot was lonely, they were stronger thanhe, they would devise means to seize him or to get him away, and the manwhom Marius was anxious to save would be lost. One o&rsquo;clock had juststruck, the trap was to be sprung at six. Marius had five hours beforehim.</p><p>There was but one thing to be done.</p><p>He put on his decent coat, knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck,took his hat, and went out, without making any more noise than if he hadbeen treading on moss with bare feet.</p><p>Moreover, the Jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron.</p><p>Once outside of the house, he made for the Rue du Petit-Banquier.</p><p>He had almost reached the middle of this street, near a very low wallwhich a man can easily step over at certain points, and which abuts on awaste space, and was walking slowly, in consequence of his preoccupiedcondition, and the snow deadened the sound of his steps; all at once heheard voices talking very close by. He turned his head, the street wasdeserted, there was not a soul in it, it was broad daylight, and yet hedistinctly heard voices.</p><p>It occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting.</p><p>There, in fact, sat two men, flat on the snow, with their backs againstthe wall, talking together in subdued tones.</p><p>These two persons were strangers to him; one was a bearded man in ablouse, and the other a long-haired individual in rags. The bearded manhad on a fez, the other&rsquo;s head was bare, and the snow had lodged in hishair.</p><p>By thrusting his head over the wall, Marius could hear their remarks.</p><p>The hairy one jogged the other man&rsquo;s elbow and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;With the assistance of Patron-Minette, it can&rsquo;t fail.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said the bearded man.</p><p>And the long-haired one began again:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as good as a warrant for each one, of five hundred balls, and theworst that can happen is five years, six years, ten years at the most!&rdquo;</p><p>The other replied with some hesitation, and shivering beneath his fez:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a real thing. You can&rsquo;t go against such things.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I tell you that the affair can&rsquo;t go wrong,&rdquo; resumed the long-haired man.&ldquo;Father What&rsquo;s-his-name&rsquo;s team will be already harnessed.&rdquo;</p><p>Then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the precedingevening at the Gaîté Theatre.</p><p>Marius went his way.</p><p>It seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men, so strangelyhidden behind that wall, and crouching in the snow, could not but bearsome relation to Jondrette&rsquo;s abominable projects. That must be <i>theaffair</i>.</p><p>He directed his course towards the faubourg Saint-Marceau and asked at thefirst shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police.</p><p>He was directed to Rue de Pontoise, No. 14.</p><p>Thither Marius betook himself.</p><p>As he passed a baker&rsquo;s shop, he bought a two-penny roll, and ate it,foreseeing that he should not dine.</p><p>On the way, he rendered justice to Providence. He reflected that had henot given his five francs to the Jondrette girl in the morning, he wouldhave followed M. Leblanc&rsquo;s fiacre, and consequently have remained ignorantof everything, and that there would have been no obstacle to the trap ofthe Jondrettes and that M. Leblanc would have been lost, and his daughterwith him, no doubt.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0214" id="link2HCH0214"></a>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;IN WHICH A POLICE AGENT BESTOWS TWO FISTFULS ON A LAWYER</h3><p>On arriving at No. 14, Rue de Pontoise, he ascended to the first floor andinquired for the commissary of police.</p><p>&ldquo;The commissary of police is not here,&rdquo; said a clerk; &ldquo;but there is aninspector who takes his place. Would you like to speak to him? Are you inhaste?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>The clerk introduced him into the commissary&rsquo;s office. There stood a tallman behind a grating, leaning against a stove, and holding up with bothhands the tails of a vast topcoat, with three collars. His face wassquare, with a thin, firm mouth, thick, gray, and very ferocious whiskers,and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out. Of that glanceit might have been well said, not that it penetrated, but that itsearched.</p><p>This man&rsquo;s air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible thanJondrette&rsquo;s; the dog is, at times, no less terrible to meet than the wolf.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he said to Marius, without adding &ldquo;monsieur.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is this Monsieur le Commissaire de Police?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is absent. I am here in his stead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The matter is very private.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then speak.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And great haste is required.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then speak quick.&rdquo;</p><p>This calm, abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and thesame time. He inspired fear and confidence. Marius related the adventureto him: That a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than bysight, was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening; that, as heoccupied the room adjoining the den, he, Marius Pontmercy, a lawyer, hadheard the whole plot through the partition; that the wretch who hadplanned the trap was a certain Jondrette; that there would be accomplices,probably some prowlers of the barriers, among others a certain Panchaud,alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille; that Jondrette&rsquo;s daughters were tolie in wait; that there was no way of warning the threatened man, since hedid not even know his name; and that, finally, all this was to be carriedout at six o&rsquo;clock that evening, at the most deserted point of theBoulevard de l&rsquo;Hôpital, in house No. 50-52.</p><p>At the sound of this number, the inspector raised his head, and saidcoldly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;So it is in the room at the end of the corridor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; answered Marius, and he added: &ldquo;Are you acquainted with thathouse?&rdquo;</p><p>The inspector remained silent for a moment, then replied, as he warmed theheel of his boot at the door of the stove:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Apparently.&rdquo;</p><p>He went on, muttering between his teeth, and not addressing Marius so muchas his cravat:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Patron-Minette must have had a hand in this.&rdquo;</p><p>This word struck Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Patron-Minette,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I did hear that word pronounced, in fact.&rdquo;</p><p>And he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long-haired manand the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the Rue duPetit-Banquier.</p><p>The inspector muttered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The long-haired man must be Brujon, and the bearded one Demi-Liard, aliasDeux-Milliards.&rdquo;</p><p>He had dropped his eyelids again, and became absorbed in thought.</p><p>&ldquo;As for Father What&rsquo;s-his-name, I think I recognize him. Here, I&rsquo;ve burnedmy coat. They always have too much fire in these cursed stoves. Number50-52. Former property of Gorbeau.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he glanced at Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;You saw only that bearded and that long-haired man?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And Panchaud.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nor a big lump of matter, resembling an elephant in the Jardin desPlantes?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As for the fourth, no one sees him, not even his adjutants, clerks, andemployees. It is not surprising that you did not see him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Who are all those persons?&rdquo; asked Marius.</p><p>The inspector answered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Besides, this is not the time for them.&rdquo;</p><p>He relapsed into silence, then resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;50-52. I know that barrack. Impossible to conceal ourselves inside itwithout the artists seeing us, and then they will get off simply bycountermanding the vaudeville. They are so modest! An audience embarrassesthem. None of that, none of that. I want to hear them sing and make themdance.&rdquo;</p><p>This monologue concluded, he turned to Marius, and demanded, gazing at himintently the while:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you afraid?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Of these men?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No more than yourself!&rdquo; retorted Marius rudely, who had begun to noticethat this police agent had not yet said &ldquo;monsieur&rdquo; to him.</p><p>The inspector stared still more intently at Marius, and continued withsententious solemnity:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There, you speak like a brave man, and like an honest man. Courage doesnot fear crime, and honesty does not fear authority.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius interrupted him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That is well, but what do you intend to do?&rdquo;</p><p>The inspector contented himself with the remark:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The lodgers have pass-keys with which to get in at night. You must haveone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Have you it about you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; said the inspector.</p><p>Marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket, handed it to the inspectorand added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;If you will take my advice, you will come in force.&rdquo;</p><p>The inspector cast on Marius such a glance as Voltaire might have bestowedon a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him; with onemovement he plunged his hands, which were enormous, into the two immensepockets of his top-coat, and pulled out two small steel pistols, of thesort called &ldquo;knock-me-downs.&rdquo; Then he presented them to Marius, sayingrapidly, in a curt tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Take these. Go home. Hide in your chamber, so that you may be supposed tohave gone out. They are loaded. Each one carries two balls. You will keepwatch; there is a hole in the wall, as you have informed me. These menwill come. Leave them to their own devices for a time. When you thinkmatters have reached a crisis, and that it is time to put a stop to them,fire a shot. Not too soon. The rest concerns me. A shot into the ceiling,the air, no matter where. Above all things, not too soon. Wait until theybegin to put their project into execution; you are a lawyer; you know theproper point.&rdquo; Marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket ofhis coat.</p><p>&ldquo;That makes a lump that can be seen,&rdquo; said the inspector. &ldquo;Put them inyour trousers pocket.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; pursued the inspector, &ldquo;there is not a minute more to be lost byany one. What time is it? Half-past two.

A pistol shot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rest easy,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>And as Marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out, theinspector called to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;By the way, if you have occasion for my services between now and then,come or send here.

Bossuet was just saying to Courfeyrac:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;One would say, to see all these snow-flakes fall, that there was a plagueof white butterflies in heaven.&rdquo; All at once, Bossuet caught sight ofMarius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar air.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; said Bossuet. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Marius.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I saw him,&rdquo; said Courfeyrac. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s speak to him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is busy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see his air?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What air?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He has the air of a man who is following some one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Bossuet.</p><p>&ldquo;Just see the eyes he is making!&rdquo; said Courfeyrac.</p><p>&ldquo;But who the deuce is he following?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Some fine, flowery bonneted wench! He&rsquo;s in love.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; observed Bossuet, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any wench nor any flowery bonnet inthe street. There&rsquo;s not a woman round.&rdquo;</p><p>Courfeyrac took a survey, and exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s following a man!&rdquo;</p><p>A man, in fact, wearing a gray cap, and whose gray beard could bedistinguished, although they only saw his back, was walking along abouttwenty paces in advance of Marius.</p><p>This man was dressed in a great-coat which was perfectly new and too largefor him, and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags and blackwith mud.</p><p>Bossuet burst out laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He?&rdquo; retorted Courfeyrac, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a poet. Poets are very fond of wearingthe trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers ofFrance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see where Marius will go,&rdquo; said Bossuet; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see where the manis going, let&rsquo;s follow them, hey?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bossuet!&rdquo; exclaimed Courfeyrac, &ldquo;eagle of Meaux! You are a prodigiousbrute. Follow a man who is following another man, indeed!&rdquo;</p><p>They retraced their steps.</p><p>Marius had, in fact, seen Jondrette passing along the Rue Mouffetard, andwas spying on his proceedings.</p><p>Jondrette walked straight ahead, without a suspicion that he was alreadyheld by a glance.</p><p>He quitted the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him enter one of the mostterrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse; he remained there about a quarter ofan hour, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. He halted at an ironmonger&rsquo;sshop, which then stood at the corner of the Rue Pierre-Lombard, and a fewminutes later Marius saw him emerge from the shop, holding in his hand ahuge cold chisel with a white wood handle, which he concealed beneath hisgreat-coat. At the top of the Rue Petit-Gentilly he turned to the left andproceeded rapidly to the Rue du Petit-Banquier. The day was declining; thesnow, which had ceased for a moment, had just begun again. Marius postedhimself on the watch at the very corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier,which was deserted, as usual, and did not follow Jondrette into it. It waslucky that he did so, for, on arriving in the vicinity of the wall whereMarius had heard the long-haired man and the bearded man conversing,Jondrette turned round, made sure that no one was following him, did notsee him, then sprang across the wall and disappeared.</p><p>The waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of anex-livery stable-keeper of bad repute, who had failed and who still kept afew old single-seated berlins under his sheds.</p><p>Marius thought that it would be wise to profit by Jondrette&rsquo;s absence toreturn home; moreover, it was growing late; every evening, Ma&rsquo;am Bougonwhen she set out for her dish-washing in town, had a habit of locking thedoor, which was always closed at dusk. Marius had given his key to theinspector of police; it was important, therefore, that he should makehaste.</p><p>Evening had arrived, night had almost closed in; on the horizon and in theimmensity of space, there remained but one spot illuminated by the sun,and that was the moon.</p><p>It was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of Salpêtrière.</p><p>Marius returned to No. 50-52 with great strides. The door was still openwhen he arrived. He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided along thewall of the corridor to his chamber. This corridor, as the reader willremember, was bordered on both sides by attics, all of which were, for themoment, empty and to let. Ma&rsquo;am Bougon was in the habit of leaving all thedoors open. As he passed one of these attics, Marius thought he perceivedin the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men, vaguely lightedup by a remnant of daylight, falling through a dormer window.</p><p>Marius made no attempt to see, not wishing to be seen himself. Hesucceeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without makingany noise. It was high time. A moment later he heard Ma&rsquo;am Bougon take herdeparture, locking the door of the house behind her.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0216" id="link2HCH0216"></a>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE WORDS TO AN ENGLISH AIR WHICHWAS IN FASHION IN 1832</h3><p>Marius seated himself on his bed. It might have been half-past fiveo&rsquo;clock. Only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen. Heheard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch inthe dark. He thought of the double march which was going on at that momentin the dark,&mdash;crime advancing on one side, justice coming up on theother. He was not afraid, but he could not think without a shudder of whatwas about to take place. As is the case with all those who are suddenlyassailed by an unforeseen adventure, the entire day produced upon him theeffect of a dream, and in order to persuade himself that he was not theprey of a nightmare, he had to feel the cold barrels of the steel pistolsin his trousers pockets.</p><p>It was no longer snowing; the moon disengaged itself more and more clearlyfrom the mist, and its light, mingled with the white reflection of thesnow which had fallen, communicated to the chamber a sort of twilightaspect.</p><p>There was a light in the Jondrette den. Marius saw the hole in the wallshining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him.</p><p>It was true that the light could not be produced by a candle. However,there was not a sound in the Jondrette quarters, not a soul was movingthere, not a soul speaking, not a breath; the silence was glacial andprofound, and had it not been for that light, he might have thoughthimself next door to a sepulchre.</p><p>Marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed.</p><p>Several minutes elapsed. Marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges; aheavy step mounted the staircase, and hastened along the corridor; thelatch of the hovel was noisily lifted; it was Jondrette returning.</p><p>Instantly, several voices arose. The whole family was in the garret. Only,it had been silent in the master&rsquo;s absence, like wolf whelps in theabsence of the wolf.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;Good evening, daddy,&rdquo; yelped the girls.</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said the mother.</p><p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s going first-rate,&rdquo; responded Jondrette, &ldquo;but my feet are beastlycold. Good! You have dressed up. You have done well! You must inspireconfidence.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All ready to go out.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget what I told you. You will do everything sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rest easy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo; said Jondrette. And he left the phrase unfinished.</p><p>Marius heard him lay something heavy on the table, probably the chiselwhich he had purchased.</p><p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Jondrette, &ldquo;have you been eating here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;I got three large potatoes and some salt. I tookadvantage of the fire to cook them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; returned Jondrette. &ldquo;To-morrow I will take you out to dine withme. We will have a duck and fixings. You shall dine like Charles theTenth; all is going well!&rdquo;</p><p>Then he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The mouse-trap is open. The cats are there.&rdquo;</p><p>He lowered his voice still further, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Put this in the fire.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some ironutensil, and Jondrette continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the mother.</p><p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nearly six. The half-hour struck from Saint-Médard a while ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; ejaculated Jondrette; &ldquo;the children must go and watch. Comeyou, do you listen here.&rdquo;</p><p>A whispering ensued.</p><p>Jondrette&rsquo;s voice became audible again:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Has old Bougon left?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the mother.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure that there is no one in our neighbor&rsquo;s room?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He has not been in all day, and you know very well that this is hisdinner hour.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; said Jondrette, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no harm in going to see whetherhe is there. Here, my girl, take the candle and go there.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed.</p><p>Hardly had he concealed himself, when he perceived a light through thecrack of his door.</p><p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;pa,&rdquo; cried a voice, &ldquo;he is not in here.&rdquo;</p><p>He recognized the voice of the eldest daughter.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you go in?&rdquo; demanded her father.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the girl, &ldquo;but as his key is in the door, he must be out.&rdquo;</p><p>The father exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Go in, nevertheless.&rdquo;</p><p>The door opened, and Marius saw the tall Jondrette come in with a candlein her hand. She was as she had been in the morning, only still morerepulsive in this light.</p><p>She walked straight up to the bed. Marius endured an indescribable momentof anxiety; but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall, and itwas thither that she was directing her steps. She raised herself on tiptoeand looked at herself in it. In the neighboring room, the sound of ironarticles being moved was audible.</p><p>She smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, and smiled into themirror, humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Nos amours ont duré toute une semaine,<br/>Mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts!<br/>S&rsquo;adorer huit jours, c&rsquo;était bien la peine!<br/>Le temps des amours devrait durer toujours!<br/>Devrait durer toujours! devrait durer toujours!<a href="#linknote-28" name="linknoteref-28" id="linknoteref-28">28</a></p><p>In the meantime, Marius trembled. It seemed impossible to him that sheshould not hear his breathing.</p><p>She stepped to the window and looked out with the half-foolish way shehad.</p><p>&ldquo;How ugly Paris is when it has put on a white chemise!&rdquo; said she.</p><p>She returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it,scrutinizing herself full-face and three-quarters face in turn.</p><p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried her father, &ldquo;what are you about there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am looking under the bed and the furniture,&rdquo; she replied, continuing toarrange her hair; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no one here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Booby!&rdquo; yelled her father. &ldquo;Come here this minute! And don&rsquo;t waste anytime about it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Coming! Coming!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;One has no time for anything in this hovel!&rdquo;</p><p>She hummed:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Vous me quittez pour aller à la gloire;<br/>Mon triste cœur suivra partout.<a href="#linknote-29" name="linknoteref-29" id="linknoteref-29">29</a></p><p>She cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out, shutting the doorbehind her.</p><p>A moment more, and Marius heard the sound of the two young girls&rsquo; barefeet in the corridor, and Jondrette&rsquo;s voice shouting to them:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Pay strict heed! One on the side of the barrier, the other at the cornerof the Rue du Petit-Banquier. Don&rsquo;t lose sight for a moment of the door ofthis house, and the moment you see anything, rush here on the instant! ashard as you can go! You have a key to get in.&rdquo;</p><p>The eldest girl grumbled:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To-morrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots!&rdquo; said thefather.</p><p>They ran downstairs, and a few seconds later the shock of the outer dooras it banged to announced that they were outside.</p><p>There now remained in the house only Marius, the Jondrettes and probably,also, the mysterious persons of whom Marius had caught a glimpse in thetwilight, behind the door of the unused attic.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0217" id="link2HCH0217"></a>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;THE USE MADE OF MARIUS&rsquo; FIVE-FRANC PIECE</h3><p>Marius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume hispost at his observatory. In a twinkling, and with the agility of his age,he had reached the hole in the partition.</p><p>He looked.</p><p>The interior of the Jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect, andMarius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed. Acandle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris, but that wasnot what really lighted the chamber. The hovel was completely illuminated,as it were, by the reflection from a rather large sheet-iron brazierstanding in the fireplace, and filled with burning charcoal, the brazierprepared by the Jondrette woman that morning. The charcoal was glowing hotand the brazier was red; a blue flame flickered over it, and helped him tomake out the form of the chisel purchased by Jondrette in the RuePierre-Lombard, where it had been thrust into the brazier to heat. In onecorner, near the door, and as though prepared for some definite use, twoheaps were visible, which appeared to be, the one a heap of old iron, theother a heap of ropes. All this would have caused the mind of a person whoknew nothing of what was in preparation, to waver between a very sinisterand a very simple idea. The lair thus lighted up more resembled a forgethan a mouth of hell, but Jondrette, in this light, had rather the air ofa demon than of a smith.</p><p>The heat of the brazier was so great, that the candle on the table wasmelting on the side next the chafing-dish, and was drooping over. An olddark-lantern of copper, worthy of Diogenes turned Cartouche, stood on thechimney-piece.</p><p>The brazier, placed in the fireplace itself, beside the nearly extinctbrands, sent its vapors up the chimney, and gave out no odor.</p><p>The moon, entering through the four panes of the window, cast itswhiteness into the crimson and flaming garret; and to the poetic spirit ofMarius, who was dreamy even in the moment of action, it was like a thoughtof heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth.</p><p>A breath of air which made its way in through the open pane, helped todissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of thebrazier.</p><p>The Jondrette lair was, if the reader recalls what we have said of theGorbeau building, admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violentand sombre deed, and as the envelope for a crime. It was the most retiredchamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted boulevard inParis. If the system of ambush and traps had not already existed, theywould have been invented there.</p><p>The whole thickness of a house and a multitude of uninhabited roomsseparated this den from the boulevard, and the only window that existedopened on waste lands enclosed with walls and palisades.</p><p>Jondrette had lighted his pipe, seated himself on the seatless chair, andwas engaged in smoking. His wife was talking to him in a low tone.</p><p>If Marius had been Courfeyrac, that is to say, one of those men who laughon every occasion in life, he would have burst with laughter when his gazefell on the Jondrette woman. She had on a black bonnet with plumes notunlike the hats of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation of Charles X., animmense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat, and the man&rsquo;s shoes whichher daughter had scorned in the morning. It was this toilette which hadextracted from Jondrette the exclamation: &ldquo;Good! You have dressed up. Youhave done well. You must inspire confidence!&rdquo;</p><p>As for Jondrette, he had not taken off the new surtout, which was toolarge for him, and which M. Leblanc had given him, and his costumecontinued to present that contrast of coat and trousers which constitutedthe ideal of a poet in Courfeyrac&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>All at once, Jondrette lifted up his voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;By the way! Now that I think of it. In this weather, he will come in acarriage. Light the lantern, take it and go downstairs. You will standbehind the lower door. The very moment that you hear the carriage stop,you will open the door, instantly, he will come up, you will light thestaircase and the corridor, and when he enters here, you will godownstairs again as speedily as possible, you will pay the coachman,and dismiss the fiacre.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the money?&rdquo; inquired the woman.</p><p>Jondrette fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five francs.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p><p>Jondrette replied with dignity:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>And he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know what? Two chairs will be needed here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To sit on.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mildanswer from Jondrette.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardieu! I&rsquo;ll go and get one of our neighbor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>And with a rapid movement, she opened the door of the den, and went outinto the corridor.</p><p>Marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode, reach hisbed, and conceal himself beneath it.</p><p>&ldquo;Take the candle,&rdquo; cried Jondrette.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it would embarrass me, I have the two chairs to carry.There is moonlight.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius heard Mother Jondrette&rsquo;s heavy hand fumbling at his lock in thedark. The door opened. He remained nailed to the spot with the shock andwith horror.</p><p>The Jondrette entered.</p><p>The dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight between twoblocks of shadow. One of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the wallagainst which Marius was leaning, so that he disappeared within it.</p><p>Mother Jondrette raised her eyes, did not see Marius, took the two chairs,the only ones which Marius possessed, and went away, letting the door fallheavily to behind her.</p><p>She re-entered the lair.</p><p>&ldquo;Here are the two chairs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And here is the lantern. Go down as quick as you can.&rdquo;</p><p>She hastily obeyed, and Jondrette was left alone.</p><p>He placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table, turned the chiselin the brazier, set in front of the fireplace an old screen which maskedthe chafing-dish, then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope, andbent down as though to examine something. Marius then recognized the fact,that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was a very well-maderope-ladder, with wooden rungs and two hooks with which to attach it.</p><p>This ladder, and some large tools, veritable masses of iron, which weremingled with the old iron piled up behind the door, had not been in theJondrette hovel in the morning, and had evidently been brought thither inthe afternoon, during Marius&rsquo; absence.</p><p>&ldquo;Those are the utensils of an edge-tool maker,&rdquo; thought Marius.</p><p>Had Marius been a little more learned in this line, he would haverecognized in what he took for the engines of an edge-tool maker, certaininstruments which will force a lock or pick a lock, and others which willcut or slice, the two families of tools which burglars call <i>cadets</i>and <i>fauchants</i>.</p><p>The fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite Marius. The brazierbeing concealed, the only light in the room was now furnished by thecandle; the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the chimney-piececast a large shadow. There was something indescribably calm, threatening,and hideous about this chamber. One felt that there existed in it theanticipation of something terrible.</p><p>Jondrette had allowed his pipe to go out, a serious sign of preoccupation,and had again seated himself. The candle brought out the fierce and thefine angles of his countenance. He indulged in scowls and in abruptunfoldings of the right hand, as though he were responding to the lastcounsels of a sombre inward monologue. In the course of one of these darkreplies which he was making to himself, he pulled the table drawer rapidlytowards him, took out a long kitchen knife which was concealed there, andtried the edge of its blade on his nail. That done, he put the knife backin the drawer and shut it.</p><p>Marius, on his side, grasped the pistol in his right pocket, drew it outand cocked it.</p><p>The pistol emitted a sharp, clear click, as he cocked it.</p><p>Jondrette started, half rose, listened a moment, then began to laugh andsaid:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What a fool I am! It&rsquo;s the partition cracking!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius kept the pistol in his hand.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0218" id="link2HCH0218"></a>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;MARIUS&rsquo; TWO CHAIRS FORM A VIS-A-VIS</h3><p>Suddenly, the distant and melancholy vibration of a clock shook the panes.Six o&rsquo;clock was striking from Saint-Médard.</p><p>Jondrette marked off each stroke with a toss of his head. When the sixthhad struck, he snuffed the candle with his fingers.</p><p>Then he began to pace up and down the room, listened at the corridor,walked on again, then listened once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Provided only that he comes!&rdquo; he muttered, then he returned to his chair.</p><p>He had hardly reseated himself when the door opened.</p><p>Mother Jondrette had opened it, and now remained in the corridor making ahorrible, amiable grimace, which one of the holes of the dark-lanternilluminated from below.</p><p>&ldquo;Enter, sir,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;Enter, my benefactor,&rdquo; repeated Jondrette, rising hastily.</p><p>M. Leblanc made his appearance.</p><p>He wore an air of serenity which rendered him singularly venerable.</p><p>He laid four louis on the table.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Fabantou,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this is for your rent and your mostpressing necessities. We will attend to the rest hereafter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;May God requite it to you, my generous benefactor!&rdquo; said Jondrette.</p><p>And rapidly approaching his wife:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Dismiss the carriage!&rdquo;</p><p>She slipped out while her husband was lavishing salutes and offering M.Leblanc a chair. An instant later she returned and whispered in his ear:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis done.&rdquo;</p><p>The snow, which had not ceased falling since the morning, was so deep thatthe arrival of the fiacre had not been audible, and they did not now hearits departure.</p><p>Meanwhile, M. Leblanc had seated himself.</p><p>Jondrette had taken possession of the other chair, facing M. Leblanc.</p><p>Now, in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow, let thereader picture to himself in his own mind, a cold night, the solitudes ofthe Salpêtrière covered with snow and white as winding-sheets in themoonlight, the taper-like lights of the street lanterns which shone redlyhere and there along those tragic boulevards, and the long rows of blackelms, not a passer-by for perhaps a quarter of a league around, theGorbeau hovel, at its highest pitch of silence, of horror, and ofdarkness; in that building, in the midst of those solitudes, in the midstof that darkness, the vast Jondrette garret lighted by a single candle,and in that den two men seated at a table, M. Leblanc tranquil, Jondrettesmiling and alarming, the Jondrette woman, the female wolf, in one corner,and, behind the partition, Marius, invisible, erect, not losing a word,not missing a single movement, his eye on the watch, and pistol in hand.</p><p>However, Marius experienced only an emotion of horror, but no fear. Heclasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured. &ldquo;I shall beable to stop that wretch whenever I please,&rdquo; he thought.</p><p>He felt that the police were there somewhere in ambuscade, waiting for thesignal agreed upon and ready to stretch out their arm.</p><p>Moreover, he was in hopes, that this violent encounter between Jondretteand M.

Leblanc seated, when he turned his eyes towards the pallets,which were empty.</p><p>&ldquo;How is the poor little wounded girl?&rdquo; he inquired.</p><p>&ldquo;Bad,&rdquo; replied Jondrette with a heart-broken and grateful smile, &ldquo;verybad, my worthy sir. Her elder sister has taken her to the Bourbe to haveher hurt dressed. You will see them presently; they will be backimmediately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Madame Fabantou seems to me to be better,&rdquo; went on M. Leblanc, castinghis eyes on the eccentric costume of the Jondrette woman, as she stoodbetween him and the door, as though already guarding the exit, and gazedat him in an attitude of menace and almost of combat.</p><p>&ldquo;She is dying,&rdquo; said Jondrette. &ldquo;But what do you expect, sir! She has somuch courage, that woman has! She&rsquo;s not a woman, she&rsquo;s an ox.&rdquo;</p><p>The Jondrette, touched by his compliment, deprecated it with the affectedairs of a flattered monster.</p><p>&ldquo;You are always too good to me, Monsieur Jondrette!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jondrette!&rdquo; said M. Leblanc, &ldquo;I thought your name was Fabantou?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fabantou, alias Jondrette!&rdquo; replied the husband hurriedly. &ldquo;An artisticsobriquet!&rdquo;</p><p>And launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which M.

Whatwould there be left for us if we had not that? We are so wretched, myrespectable sir! We have arms, but there is no work! We have the will, nowork!

What a fall, mybenefactor! What a degradation, when one has been what we have been! Alas!There is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity! One thing only, apicture, of which I think a great deal, but which I am willing to partwith, for I must live! Item, one must live!&rdquo;</p><p>While Jondrette thus talked, with an apparent incoherence which detractednothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his physiognomy,Marius raised his eyes, and perceived at the other end of the room aperson whom he had not seen before. A man had just entered, so softly thatthe door had not been heard to turn on its hinges. This man wore a violetknitted vest, which was old, worn, spotted, cut and gaping at every fold,wide trousers of cotton velvet, wooden shoes on his feet, no shirt, hadhis neck bare, his bare arms tattooed, and his face smeared with black. Hehad seated himself in silence on the nearest bed, and, as he was behindJondrette, he could only be indistinctly seen.</p><p>That sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze, caused M.Leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as Marius. He could notrefrain from a gesture of surprise which did not escape Jondrette.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! I see!&rdquo; exclaimed Jondrette, buttoning up his coat with an air ofcomplaisance, &ldquo;you are looking at your overcoat? It fits me! My faith, butit fits me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is that man?&rdquo; said M. Leblanc.</p><p>&ldquo;Him?&rdquo; ejaculated Jondrette, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a neighbor of mine. Don&rsquo;t pay anyattention to him.&rdquo;</p><p>The neighbor was a singular-looking individual. However, manufactories ofchemical products abound in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Many of theworkmen might have black faces. Besides this, M. Leblanc&rsquo;s whole personwas expressive of candid and intrepid confidence.</p><p>He went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me; what were you saying, M. Fabantou?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I was telling you, sir, and dear protector,&rdquo; replied Jondrette placinghis elbows on the table and contemplating M. Leblanc with steady andtender eyes, not unlike the eyes of the boa-constrictor, &ldquo;I was tellingyou, that I have a picture to sell.&rdquo;</p><p>A slight sound came from the door. A second man had just entered andseated himself on the bed, behind Jondrette.</p><p>Like the first, his arms were bare, and he had a mask of ink or lampblack.</p><p>Although this man had, literally, glided into the room, he had not beenable to prevent M. Leblanc catching sight of him.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind them,&rdquo; said Jondrette, &ldquo;they are people who belong in thehouse. So I was saying, that there remains in my possession a valuablepicture. But stop, sir, take a look at it.&rdquo;</p><p>He rose, went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which wehave already mentioned, and turned it round, still leaving it supportedagainst the wall. It really was something which resembled a picture, andwhich the candle illuminated, somewhat. Marius could make nothing out ofit, as Jondrette stood between the picture and him; he only saw a coarsedaub, and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh crudity offoreign canvasses and screen paintings.</p><p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked M. Leblanc.</p><p>Jondrette exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;A painting by a master, a picture of great value, my benefactor! I am asmuch attached to it as I am to my two daughters; it recalls souvenirs tome! But I have told you, and I will not take it back, that I am sowretched that I will part with it.&rdquo;</p><p>Either by chance, or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness, M.Leblanc&rsquo;s glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined thepicture.</p><p>There were now four men, three seated on the bed, one standing near thedoor-post, all four with bare arms and motionless, with faces smeared withblack. One of those on the bed was leaning against the wall, with closedeyes, and it might have been supposed that he was asleep. He was old; hiswhite hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a horrible effect.The other two seemed to be young; one wore a beard, the other wore hishair long. None of them had on shoes; those who did not wear socks werebarefooted.</p><p>Jondrette noticed that M. Leblanc&rsquo;s eye was fixed on these men.</p><p>&ldquo;They are friends. They are neighbors,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Their faces are blackbecause they work in charcoal. They are chimney-builders. Don&rsquo;t troubleyourself about them, my benefactor, but buy my picture. Have pity on mymisery. I will not ask you much for it. How much do you think it isworth?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said M. Leblanc, looking Jondrette full in the eye, and with themanner of a man who is on his guard, &ldquo;it is some signboard for a tavern,and is worth about three francs.&rdquo;</p><p>Jondrette replied sweetly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you your pocket-book with you? I should be satisfied with a thousandcrowns.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Leblanc sprang up, placed his back against the wall, and cast a rapidglance around the room. He had Jondrette on his left, on the side next thewindow, and the Jondrette woman and the four men on his right, on the sidenext the door. The four men did not stir, and did not even seem to belooking on.</p><p>Jondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone, with so vague aneye, and so lamentable an intonation, that M. Leblanc might have supposedthat what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad with misery.</p><p>&ldquo;If you do not buy my picture, my dear benefactor,&rdquo; said Jondrette, &ldquo;Ishall be left without resources; there will be nothing left for me but tothrow myself into the river. When I think that I wanted to have my twogirls taught the middle-class paper-box trade, the making of boxes for NewYear&rsquo;s gifts! Well! A table with a board at the end to keep the glassesfrom falling off is required, then a special stove is needed, a pot withthree compartments for the different degrees of strength of the paste,according as it is to be used for wood, paper, or stuff, a paring-knife tocut the cardboard, a mould to adjust it, a hammer to nail the steels,pincers, how the devil do I know what all? And all that in order to earnfour sous a day! And you have to work fourteen hours a day! And each boxpasses through the workwoman&rsquo;s hands thirteen times! And you can&rsquo;t wet thepaper! And you mustn&rsquo;t spot anything! And you must keep the paste hot. Thedevil, I tell you! Four sous a day! How do you suppose a man is to live?&rdquo;</p><p>As he spoke, Jondrette did not look at M. Leblanc, who was observing him.M. Leblanc&rsquo;s eye was fixed on Jondrette, and Jondrette&rsquo;s eye was fixed onthe door. Marius&rsquo; eager attention was transferred from one to the other.M. Leblanc seemed to be asking himself: &ldquo;Is this man an idiot?&rdquo; Jondretterepeated two or three distinct times, with all manner of varyinginflections of the whining and supplicating order: &ldquo;There is nothing leftfor me but to throw myself into the river! I went down three steps at theside of the bridge of Austerlitz the other day for that purpose.&rdquo;</p><p>All at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash; the little mandrew himself up and became terrible, took a step toward M. Leblanc andcried in a voice of thunder: &ldquo;That has nothing to do with the question! Doyou know me?&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0220" id="link2HCH0220"></a>CHAPTER XX&mdash;THE TRAP</h3><p>The door of the garret had just opened abruptly, and allowed a view ofthree men clad in blue linen blouses, and masked with masks of blackpaper. The first was thin, and had a long, iron-tipped cudgel; the second,who was a sort of colossus, carried, by the middle of the handle, with theblade downward, a butcher&rsquo;s pole-axe for slaughtering cattle. The third, aman with thick-set shoulders, not so slender as the first, held in hishand an enormous key stolen from the door of some prison.</p><p>It appeared that the arrival of these men was what Jondrette had beenwaiting for. A rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with thecudgel, the thin one.</p><p>&ldquo;Is everything ready?&rdquo; said Jondrette.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the thin man.</p><p>&ldquo;Where is Montparnasse?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The young principal actor stopped to chat with your girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The eldest.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is there a carriage at the door?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is the team harnessed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With two good horses?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excellent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it waiting where I ordered?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Jondrette.</p><p>M. Leblanc was very pale. He was scrutinizing everything around him in theden, like a man who understands what he has fallen into, and his head,directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him, moved on hisneck with an astonished and attentive slowness, but there was nothing inhis air which resembled fear. He had improvised an intrenchment out of thetable; and the man, who but an instant previously, had borne merely theappearance of a kindly old man, had suddenly become a sort of athlete, andplaced his robust fist on the back of his chair, with a formidable andsurprising gesture.</p><p>This old man, who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such adanger, seemed to possess one of those natures which are as courageous asthey are kind, both easily and simply. The father of a woman whom we loveis never a stranger to us. Marius felt proud of that unknown man.</p><p>Three of the men, of whom Jondrette had said: &ldquo;They are chimney-builders,&rdquo; had armed themselves from the pile of old iron, one with a heavy pair ofshears, the second with weighing-tongs, the third with a hammer, and hadplaced themselves across the entrance without uttering a syllable. The oldman had remained on the bed, and had merely opened his eyes. The Jondrettewoman had seated herself beside him.</p><p>Marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for interventionwould arrive, and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling, in thedirection of the corridor, in readiness to discharge his pistol.</p><p>Jondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel,turned once more to M. Leblanc, and repeated his question, accompanying itwith that low, repressed, and terrible laugh which was peculiar to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;So you do not recognize me?&rdquo;</p><p>M. Leblanc looked him full in the face, and replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>Then Jondrette advanced to the table. He leaned across the candle,crossing his arms, putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to M.Leblanc&rsquo;s calm face, and advancing as far as possible without forcing M.Leblanc to retreat, and, in this posture of a wild beast who is about tobite, he exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My name is not Fabantou, my name is not Jondrette, my name is Thénardier.I am the inn-keeper of Montfermeil! Do you understand? Thénardier! Now doyou know me?&rdquo;</p><p>An almost imperceptible flush crossed M. Leblanc&rsquo;s brow, and he repliedwith a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level,with his accustomed placidity:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;No more than before.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius did not hear this reply. Any one who had seen him at that momentthrough the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard, stupid,thunder-struck. At the moment when Jondrette said: &ldquo;My name isThénardier,&rdquo; Marius had trembled in every limb, and had leaned against thewall, as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his heart. Thenhis right arm, all ready to discharge the signal shot, dropped slowly, andat the moment when Jondrette repeated, &ldquo;Thénardier, do you understand?&rdquo; Marius&rsquo;s faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol fall.Jondrette, by revealing his identity, had not moved M. Leblanc, but he hadquite upset Marius. That name of Thénardier, with which M. Leblanc did notseem to be acquainted, Marius knew well. Let the reader recall what thatname meant to him! That name he had worn on his heart, inscribed in hisfather&rsquo;s testament! He bore it at the bottom of his mind, in the depths ofhis memory, in that sacred injunction: &ldquo;A certain Thénardier saved mylife. If my son encounters him, he will do him all the good that lies inhis power.&rdquo; That name, it will be remembered, was one of the pieties ofhis soul; he mingled it with the name of his father in his worship. What!This man was that Thénardier, that inn-keeper of Montfermeil whom he hadso long and so vainly sought! He had found him at last, and how? Hisfather&rsquo;s saviour was a ruffian! That man, to whose service Marius wasburning to devote himself, was a monster! That liberator of ColonelPontmercy was on the point of committing a crime whose scope Marius didnot, as yet, clearly comprehend, but which resembled an assassination! Andagainst whom, great God! what a fatality! What a bitter mockery of fate!His father had commanded him from the depths of his coffin to do all thegood in his power to this Thénardier, and for four years Marius hadcherished no other thought than to acquit this debt of his father&rsquo;s, andat the moment when he was on the eve of having a brigand seized in thevery act of crime by justice, destiny cried to him: &ldquo;This is Thénardier!&rdquo; He could at last repay this man for his father&rsquo;s life, saved amid ahail-storm of grape-shot on the heroic field of Waterloo, and repay itwith the scaffold! He had sworn to himself that if ever he found thatThénardier, he would address him only by throwing himself at his feet; andnow he actually had found him, but it was only to deliver him over to theexecutioner! His father said to him: &ldquo;Succor Thénardier!&rdquo; And he repliedto that adored and sainted voice by crushing Thénardier! He was about tooffer to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man who had tornhim from death at the peril of his own life, executed on the PlaceSaint-Jacques through the means of his son, of that Marius to whom he hadentrusted that man by his will! And what a mockery to have so long worn onhis breast his father&rsquo;s last commands, written in his own hand, only toact in so horribly contrary a sense! But, on the other hand, now look onthat trap and not prevent it! Condemn the victim and to spare theassassin! Could one be held to any gratitude towards so miserable awretch? All the ideas which Marius had cherished for the last four yearswere pierced through and through, as it were, by this unforeseen blow.</p><p>He shuddered. Everything depended on him. Unknown to themselves, he heldin his hand all those beings who were moving about there before his eyes.If he fired his pistol, M. Leblanc was saved, and Thénardier lost; if hedid not fire, M. Leblanc would be sacrificed, and, who knows? Thénardierwould escape. Should he dash down the one or allow the other to fall?Remorse awaited him in either case.</p><p>What was he to do? What should he choose? Be false to the most imperioussouvenirs, to all those solemn vows to himself, to the most sacred duty,to the most venerated text! Should he ignore his father&rsquo;s testament, orallow the perpetration of a crime! On the one hand, it seemed to him thathe heard &ldquo;his Ursule&rdquo; supplicating for her father and on the other, thecolonel commending Thénardier to his care. He felt that he was going mad.His knees gave way beneath him. And he had not even the time fordeliberation, so great was the fury with which the scene before his eyeswas hastening to its catastrophe. It was like a whirlwind of which he hadthought himself the master, and which was now sweeping him away. He was onthe verge of swooning.</p><p>In the meantime, Thénardier, whom we shall henceforth call by no othername, was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy andwild triumph.</p><p>He seized the candle in his fist, and set it on the chimney-piece with soviolent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished, and the tallowbespattered the wall.</p><p>Then he turned to M. Leblanc with a horrible look, and spit out thesewords:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Done for! Smoked brown! Cooked! Spitchcocked!&rdquo;</p><p>And again he began to march back and forth, in full eruption.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ve found you again at last, Mister philanthropist!Mister threadbare millionnaire! Mister giver of dolls! you old ninny! Ah!so you don&rsquo;t recognize me! No, it wasn&rsquo;t you who came to Montfermeil, tomy inn, eight years ago, on Christmas eve, 1823! It wasn&rsquo;t you who carriedoff that Fantine&rsquo;s child from me! The Lark! It wasn&rsquo;t you who had a yellowgreat-coat! No! Nor a package of duds in your hand, as you had thismorning here! Say, wife, it seems to be his mania to carry packets ofwoollen stockings into houses! Old charity monger, get out with you! Areyou a hosier, Mister millionnaire? You give away your stock in trade tothe poor, holy man! What bosh! merry Andrew! Ah! and you don&rsquo;t recognizeme? Well, I recognize you, that I do! I recognized you the very moment youpoked your snout in here. Ah! you&rsquo;ll find out presently, that it isn&rsquo;t allroses to thrust yourself in that fashion into people&rsquo;s houses, under thepretext that they are taverns, in wretched clothes, with the air of a poorman, to whom one would give a sou, to deceive persons, to play thegenerous, to take away their means of livelihood, and to make threats inthe woods, and you can&rsquo;t call things quits because afterwards, when peopleare ruined, you bring a coat that is too large, and two miserable hospitalblankets, you old blackguard, you child-stealer!&rdquo;</p><p>He paused, and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment. One wouldhave said that his wrath had fallen into some hole, like the Rhone; then,as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been saying tohimself in a whisper, he smote the table with his fist, and shouted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And with his goody-goody air!&rdquo;</p><p>And, apostrophizing M. Leblanc:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Parbleu! You made game of me in the past! You are the cause of all mymisfortunes! For fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom I had, and whocertainly belonged to rich people, and who had already brought in a greatdeal of money, and from whom I might have extracted enough to live on allmy life! A girl who would have made up to me for everything that I lost inthat vile cook-shop, where there was nothing but one continual row, andwhere, like a fool, I ate up my last farthing! Oh! I wish all the winefolks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it! Well, nevermind! Say, now! You must have thought me ridiculous when you went off withthe Lark! You had your cudgel in the forest. You were the stronger.Revenge. I&rsquo;m the one to hold the trumps to-day! You&rsquo;re in a sorry case, mygood fellow! Oh, but I can laugh! Really, I laugh! Didn&rsquo;t he fall into thetrap! I told him that I was an actor, that my name was Fabantou, that Ihad played comedy with Mamselle Mars, with Mamselle Muche, that mylandlord insisted on being paid tomorrow, the 4th of February, and hedidn&rsquo;t even notice that the 8th of January, and not the 4th of February isthe time when the quarter runs out! Absurd idiot! And the four miserablePhilippes which he has brought me! Scoundrel! He hadn&rsquo;t the heart even togo as high as a hundred francs! And how he swallowed my platitudes! Thatdid amuse me. I said to myself: &lsquo;Blockhead! Come, I&rsquo;ve got you! I lickyour paws this morning, but I&rsquo;ll gnaw your heart this evening!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier paused. He was out of breath. His little, narrow chest pantedlike a forge bellows. His eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of afeeble, cruel, and cowardly creature, which finds that it can, at last,harass what it has feared, and insult what it has flattered, the joy of adwarf who should be able to set his heel on the head of Goliath, the joyof a jackal which is beginning to rend a sick bull, so nearly dead that hecan no longer defend himself, but sufficiently alive to suffer still.</p><p>M. Leblanc did not interrupt him, but said to him when he paused:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not know what you mean to say. You are mistaken in me. I am a verypoor man, and anything but a millionnaire. I do not know you. You aremistaking me for some other person.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; roared Thénardier hoarsely, &ldquo;a pretty lie! You stick to thatpleasantry, do you! You&rsquo;re floundering, my old buck! Ah! You don&rsquo;tremember! You don&rsquo;t see who I am?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; said M. Leblanc with a politeness of accent, which atthat moment seemed peculiarly strange and powerful, &ldquo;I see that you are avillain!&rdquo;</p><p>Who has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess asusceptibility of their own, that monsters are ticklish! At this word&ldquo;villain,&rdquo; the female Thénardier sprang from the bed, Thénardier graspedhis chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t youstir!&rdquo; he shouted to his wife; and, turning to M. Leblanc:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Villain! Yes, I know that you call us that, you rich gentlemen! Stop!it&rsquo;s true that I became bankrupt, that I am in hiding, that I have nobread, that I have not a single sou, that I am a villain! It&rsquo;s three dayssince I have had anything to eat, so I&rsquo;m a villain! Ah! you folks warmyour feet, you have Sakoski boots, you have wadded great-coats, likearchbishops, you lodge on the first floor in houses that have porters, youeat truffles, you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch in the month ofJanuary, and green peas, you gorge yourselves, and when you want to knowwhether it is cold, you look in the papers to see what the engineerChevalier&rsquo;s thermometer says about it. We, it is we who are thermometers.We don&rsquo;t need to go out and look on the quay at the corner of the Tour del&rsquo;Horologe, to find out the number of degrees of cold; we feel our bloodcongealing in our veins, and the ice forming round our hearts, and we say:‘There is no God!&rsquo; And you come to our caverns, yes our caverns, for thepurpose of calling us villains! But we&rsquo;ll devour you! But we&rsquo;ll devouryou, poor little things! Just see here, Mister millionnaire: I have been asolid man, I have held a license, I have been an elector, I am abourgeois, that I am! And it&rsquo;s quite possible that you are not!&rdquo;</p><p>Here Thénardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door, andadded with a shudder:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;When I think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like acobbler!&rdquo;</p><p>Then addressing M. Leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And listen to this also, Mister philanthropist! I&rsquo;m not a suspiciouscharacter, not a bit of it! I&rsquo;m not a man whose name nobody knows, and whocomes and abducts children from houses! I&rsquo;m an old French soldier, I oughtto have been decorated! I was at Waterloo, so I was! And in the battle Isaved a general called the Comte of I don&rsquo;t know what. He told me hisname, but his beastly voice was so weak that I didn&rsquo;t hear. All I caughtwas Merci [thanks]. I&rsquo;d rather have had his name than his thanks. Thatwould have helped me to find him again. The picture that you see here, andwhich was painted by David at Bruqueselles,&mdash;do you know what itrepresents? It represents me. David wished to immortalize that feat ofprowess. I have that general on my back, and I am carrying him through thegrape-shot. There&rsquo;s the history of it! That general never did a singlething for me; he was no better than the rest! But nonetheless, I savedhis life at the risk of my own, and I have the certificate of the fact inmy pocket! I am a soldier of Waterloo, by all the furies! And now that Ihave had the goodness to tell you all this, let&rsquo;s have an end of it. Iwant money, I want a deal of money, I must have an enormous lot of money,or I&rsquo;ll exterminate you, by the thunder of the good God!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish, and waslistening. The last possibility of doubt had just vanished. It certainlywas the Thénardier of the will. Marius shuddered at that reproach ofingratitude directed against his father, and which he was on the point ofso fatally justifying. His perplexity was redoubled.</p><p>Moreover, there was in all these words of Thénardier, in his accent, inhis gesture, in his glance which darted flames at every word, there was,in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything, in that mixtureof braggadocio and abjectness, of pride and pettiness, of rage and folly,in that chaos of real griefs and false sentiments, in that immodesty of amalicious man tasting the voluptuous delights of violence, in thatshameless nudity of a repulsive soul, in that conflagration of allsufferings combined with all hatreds, something which was as hideous asevil, and as heart-rending as the truth.</p><p>The picture of the master, the painting by David which he had proposedthat M. Leblanc should purchase, was nothing else, as the reader hasdivined, than the sign of his tavern painted, as it will be remembered, byhimself, the only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck atMontfermeil.</p><p>As he had ceased to intercept Marius&rsquo; visual ray, Marius could examinethis thing, and in the daub, he actually did recognize a battle, abackground of smoke, and a man carrying another man. It was the groupcomposed of Pontmercy and Thénardier; the sergeant the rescuer, thecolonel rescued. Marius was like a drunken man; this picture restored hisfather to life in some sort; it was no longer the signboard of thewine-shop at Montfermeil, it was a resurrection; a tomb had yawned, aphantom had risen there. Marius heard his heart beating in his temples, hehad the cannon of Waterloo in his ears, his bleeding father, vaguelydepicted on that sinister panel terrified him, and it seemed to him thatthe misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him.</p><p>When Thénardier had recovered his breath, he turned his bloodshot eyes onM. Leblanc, and said to him in a low, curt voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you?&rdquo;</p><p>M. Leblanc held his peace.</p><p>In the midst of this silence, a cracked voice launched this lugubrioussarcasm from the corridor:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any wood to be split, I&rsquo;m there!&rdquo;</p><p>It was the man with the axe, who was growing merry.</p><p>At the same moment, an enormous, bristling, and clayey face made itsappearance at the door, with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth,but fangs.</p><p>It was the face of the man with the butcher&rsquo;s axe.</p><p>&ldquo;Why have you taken off your mask?&rdquo; cried Thénardier in a rage.</p><p>&ldquo;For fun,&rdquo; retorted the man.</p><p>For the last few minutes M. Leblanc had appeared to be watching andfollowing all the movements of Thénardier, who, blinded and dazzled by hisown rage, was stalking to and fro in the den with full confidence that thedoor was guarded, and of holding an unarmed man fast, he being armedhimself, of being nine against one, supposing that the female Thénardiercounted for but one man.</p><p>During his address to the man with the pole-axe, he had turned his back toM. Leblanc.</p><p>M. Leblanc seized this moment, overturned the chair with his foot and thetable with his fist, and with one bound, with prodigious agility, beforeThénardier had time to turn round, he had reached the window. To open it,to scale the frame, to bestride it, was the work of a second only. He washalf out when six robust fists seized him and dragged him backenergetically into the hovel. These were the three &ldquo;chimney-builders,&rdquo; whohad flung themselves upon him. At the same time the Thénardier woman hadwound her hands in his hair.</p><p>At the trampling which ensued, the other ruffians rushed up from thecorridor. The old man on the bed, who seemed under the influence of wine,descended from the pallet and came reeling up, with a stone-breaker&rsquo;shammer in his hand.</p><p>One of the &ldquo;chimney-builders,&rdquo; whose smirched face was lighted up by thecandle, and in whom Marius recognized, in spite of his daubing, Panchaud,alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, lifted above M. Leblanc&rsquo;s head a sortof bludgeon made of two balls of lead, at the two ends of a bar of iron.</p><p>Marius could not resist this sight. &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;forgive me!&rdquo;</p><p>And his finger sought the trigger of his pistol.</p><p>The shot was on the point of being discharged when Thénardier&rsquo;s voiceshouted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t harm him!&rdquo;</p><p>This desperate attempt of the victim, far from exasperating Thénardier,had calmed him. There existed in him two men, the ferocious man and theadroit man. Up to that moment, in the excess of his triumph in thepresence of the prey which had been brought down, and which did not stir,the ferocious man had prevailed; when the victim struggled and tried toresist, the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt him!&rdquo; he repeated, and without suspecting it, his firstsuccess was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged, and toparalyze Marius, in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared, andwho, in the face of this new phase, saw no inconvenience in waiting awhile longer.</p><p>Who knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him fromthe horrible alternative of allowing Ursule&rsquo;s father to perish, or ofdestroying the colonel&rsquo;s saviour?</p><p>A herculean struggle had begun. With one blow full in the chest, M.Leblanc had sent the old man tumbling, rolling in the middle of the room,then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two moreassailants, and he held one under each of his knees; the wretches wererattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite millstone;but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both arms and theback of his neck, and were holding him doubled up over the two&ldquo;chimney-builders&rdquo; on the floor.</p><p>Thus, the master of some and mastered by the rest, crushing those beneathhim and stifling under those on top of him, endeavoring in vain to shakeoff all the efforts which were heaped upon him, M. Leblanc disappearedunder the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar beneath a howlingpile of dogs and hounds.</p><p>They succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window, andthere they held him in awe. The Thénardier woman had not released herclutch on his hair.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mix yourself up in this affair,&rdquo; said Thénardier. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tearyour shawl.&rdquo;</p><p>The Thénardier obeyed, as the female wolf obeys the male wolf, with agrowl.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Thénardier, &ldquo;search him, you other fellows!&rdquo;</p><p>M. Leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance.</p><p>They searched him.</p><p>He had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six francs,and his handkerchief.</p><p>Thénardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket.</p><p>&ldquo;What! No pocket-book?&rdquo; he demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;No, nor watch,&rdquo; replied one of the &ldquo;chimney-builders.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; murmured the masked man who carried the big key, in thevoice of a ventriloquist, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a tough old fellow.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier went to the corner near the door, picked up a bundle of ropesand threw them at the men.</p><p>&ldquo;Tie him to the leg of the bed,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>And, catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the roomby the blow from M. Leblanc&rsquo;s fist, and who made no movement, he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is Boulatruelle dead?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Bigrenaille, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s drunk.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sweep him into a corner,&rdquo; said Thénardier.</p><p>Two of the &ldquo;chimney-builders&rdquo; pushed the drunken man into the corner nearthe heap of old iron with their feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Babet,&rdquo; said Thénardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel, &ldquo;whydid you bring so many; they were not needed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; replied the man with the cudgel, &ldquo;they all wanted to bein it. This is a bad season. There&rsquo;s no business going on.&rdquo;</p><p>The pallet on which M. Leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital bed,elevated on four coarse wooden legs, roughly hewn.</p><p>M. Leblanc let them take their own course.</p><p>The ruffians bound him securely, in an upright attitude, with his feet onthe ground at the head of the bed, the end which was most remote from thewindow, and nearest to the fireplace.</p><p>When the last knot had been tied, Thénardier took a chair and seatedhimself almost facing M. Leblanc.</p><p>Thénardier no longer looked like himself; in the course of a few momentshis face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and cunningsweetness.</p><p>Marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile of a man inofficial life the almost bestial mouth which had been foaming but a momentbefore; he gazed with amazement on that fantastic and alarmingmetamorphosis, and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a tigerconverted into a lawyer.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur&mdash;&rdquo; said Thénardier.</p><p>And dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands onM. Leblanc:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Stand off a little, and let me have a talk with the gentleman.&rdquo;</p><p>All retired towards the door.</p><p>He went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur, you did wrong to try to jump out of the window. You might havebroken your leg. Now, if you will permit me, we will converse quietly. Inthe first place, I must communicate to you an observation which I havemade which is, that you have not uttered the faintest cry.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier was right, this detail was correct, although it had escapedMarius in his agitation. M. Leblanc had barely pronounced a few words,without raising his voice, and even during his struggle with the sixruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and singularsilence.</p><p>Thénardier continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Mon Dieu! You might have shouted &lsquo;stop thief&rsquo; a bit, and I should nothave thought it improper. &lsquo;Murder!&rsquo; That, too, is said occasionally, and,so far as I am concerned, I should not have taken it in bad part. It isvery natural that you should make a little row when you find yourself withpersons who don&rsquo;t inspire you with sufficient confidence. You might havedone that, and no one would have troubled you on that account. You wouldnot even have been gagged. And I will tell you why. This room is veryprivate. That&rsquo;s its only recommendation, but it has that in its favor. Youmight fire off a mortar and it would produce about as much noise at thenearest police station as the snores of a drunken man. Here a cannon wouldmake a <i>boum</i>, and the thunder would make a <i>pouf</i>. It&rsquo;s a handylodging. But, in short, you did not shout, and it is better so. I presentyou my compliments, and I will tell you the conclusion that I draw fromthat fact: My dear sir, when a man shouts, who comes? The police. Andafter the police? Justice. Well! You have not made an outcry; that isbecause you don&rsquo;t care to have the police and the courts come in any morethan we do. It is because,&mdash;I have long suspected it,&mdash;you havesome interest in hiding something. On our side we have the same interest.So we can come to an understanding.&rdquo;</p><p>As he spoke thus, it seemed as though Thénardier, who kept his eyes fixedon M. Leblanc, were trying to plunge the sharp points which darted fromthe pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner. Moreover, hislanguage, which was stamped with a sort of moderated, subdued insolenceand crafty insolence, was reserved and almost choice, and in that rascal,who had been nothing but a robber a short time previously, one now felt&ldquo;the man who had studied for the priesthood.&rdquo;</p><p>The silence preserved by the prisoner, that precaution which had beencarried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life, thatresistance opposed to the first impulse of nature, which is to utter acry, all this, it must be confessed, now that his attention had beencalled to it, troubled Marius, and affected him with painful astonishment.</p><p>Thénardier&rsquo;s well-grounded observation still further obscured for Mariusthe dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular person on whomCourfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of Monsieur Leblanc.</p><p>But whoever he was, bound with ropes, surrounded with executioners, halfplunged, so to speak, in a grave which was closing in upon him to theextent of a degree with every moment that passed, in the presence ofThénardier&rsquo;s wrath, as in the presence of his sweetness, this man remainedimpassive; and Marius could not refrain from admiring at such a moment thesuperbly melancholy visage.</p><p>Here, evidently, was a soul which was inaccessible to terror, and whichdid not know the meaning of despair. Here was one of those men who commandamazement in desperate circumstances. Extreme as was the crisis,inevitable as was the catastrophe, there was nothing here of the agony ofthe drowning man, who opens his horror-filled eyes under the water.</p><p>Thénardier rose in an unpretending manner, went to the fireplace, shovedaside the screen, which he leaned against the neighboring pallet, and thusunmasked the brazier full of glowing coals, in which the prisoner couldplainly see the chisel white-hot and spotted here and there with tinyscarlet stars.</p><p>Then Thénardier returned to his seat beside M. Leblanc.</p><p>&ldquo;I continue,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We can come to an understanding. Let us arrangethis matter in an amicable way. I was wrong to lose my temper just now, Idon&rsquo;t know what I was thinking of, I went a great deal too far, I saidextravagant things. For example, because you are a millionnaire, I toldyou that I exacted money, a lot of money, a deal of money. That would notbe reasonable. Mon Dieu, in spite of your riches, you have expenses ofyour own&mdash;who has not? I don&rsquo;t want to ruin you, I am not a greedyfellow, after all. I am not one of those people who, because they have theadvantage of the position, profit by the fact to make themselvesridiculous. Why, I&rsquo;m taking things into consideration and making asacrifice on my side. I only want two hundred thousand francs.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Leblanc uttered not a word.</p><p>Thénardier went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You see that I put not a little water in my wine; I&rsquo;m very moderate. Idon&rsquo;t know the state of your fortune, but I do know that you don&rsquo;t stickat money, and a benevolent man like yourself can certainly give twohundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out of luck.Certainly, you are reasonable, too; you haven&rsquo;t imagined that I shouldtake all the trouble I have to-day and organized this affair this evening,which has been labor well bestowed, in the opinion of these gentlemen,merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and drink red wine atfifteen sous and eat veal at Desnoyer&rsquo;s. Two hundred thousand francs&mdash;it&rsquo;ssurely worth all that. This trifle once out of your pocket, I guaranteeyou that that&rsquo;s the end of the matter, and that you have no furtherdemands to fear. You will say to me: &lsquo;But I haven&rsquo;t two hundred thousandfrancs about me.&rsquo; Oh! I&rsquo;m not extortionate. I don&rsquo;t demand that. I onlyask one thing of you. Have the goodness to write what I am about todictate to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Here Thénardier paused; then he added, emphasizing his words, and castinga smile in the direction of the brazier:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I warn you that I shall not admit that you don&rsquo;t know how to write.&rdquo;</p><p>A grand inquisitor might have envied that smile.</p><p>Thénardier pushed the table close to M. Leblanc, and took an inkstand, apen, and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open, and inwhich gleamed the long blade of the knife.</p><p>He placed the sheet of paper before M. Leblanc.</p><p>&ldquo;Write,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>The prisoner spoke at last.</p><p>&ldquo;How do you expect me to write? I am bound.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, excuse me!&rdquo; ejaculated Thénardier, &ldquo;you are quite right.&rdquo;</p><p>And turning to Bigrenaille:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Untie the gentleman&rsquo;s right arm.&rdquo;</p><p>Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, executed Thénardier&rsquo;sorder.</p><p>When the prisoner&rsquo;s right arm was free, Thénardier dipped the pen in theink and presented it to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Understand thoroughly, sir, that you are in our power, at our discretion,that no human power can get you out of this, and that we shall be reallygrieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable extremities. I knowneither your name, nor your address, but I warn you, that you will remainbound until the person charged with carrying the letter which you areabout to write shall have returned. Now, be so good as to write.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded the prisoner.</p><p>&ldquo;I will dictate.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Leblanc took the pen.</p><p>Thénardier began to dictate:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My daughter&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>The prisoner shuddered, and raised his eyes to Thénardier.</p><p>&ldquo;Put down &lsquo;My dear daughter&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo; said Thénardier.</p><p>M. Leblanc obeyed.</p><p>Thénardier continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Come instantly&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>He paused:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You address her as <i>thou</i>, do you not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked M. Leblanc.</p><p>&ldquo;Parbleu!&rdquo; cried Thénardier, &ldquo;the little one, the Lark.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I do not know what you mean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go on, nevertheless,&rdquo; ejaculated Thénardier, and he continued to dictate:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Come immediately, I am in absolute need of thee. The person who willdeliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me. I amwaiting for thee. Come with confidence.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Leblanc had written the whole of this.</p><p>Thénardier resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! erase &lsquo;come with confidence&rsquo;; that might lead her to suppose thateverything was not as it should be, and that distrust is possible.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Leblanc erased the three words.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; pursued Thénardier, &ldquo;sign it. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p><p>The prisoner laid down the pen and demanded:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;For whom is this letter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know well,&rdquo; retorted Thénardier, &ldquo;for the little one I just told youso.&rdquo;</p><p>It was evident that Thénardier avoided naming the young girl in question.He said &ldquo;the Lark,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;the little one,&rdquo; but he did not pronounce hername&mdash;the precaution of a clever man guarding his secret from hisaccomplices. To mention the name was to deliver the whole &ldquo;affair&rdquo; intotheir hands, and to tell them more about it than there was any need oftheir knowing.</p><p>He went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Sign. What is your name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Urbain Fabre,&rdquo; said the prisoner.</p><p>Thénardier, with the movement of a cat, dashed his hand into his pocketand drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on M. Leblanc. Helooked for the mark on it, and held it close to the candle.</p><p>&ldquo;U. F. That&rsquo;s it. Urbain Fabre. Well, sign it U. F.&rdquo;</p><p>The prisoner signed.</p><p>&ldquo;As two hands are required to fold the letter, give it to me, I will foldit.&rdquo;</p><p>That done, Thénardier resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Address it, &lsquo;Mademoiselle Fabre,&rsquo; at your house. I know that you live along distance from here, near Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, because you go tomass there every day, but I don&rsquo;t know in what street. I see that youunderstand your situation. As you have not lied about your name, you willnot lie about your address. Write it yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>The prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment, then he took the pen andwrote:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Fabre, at M. Urbain Fabre&rsquo;s, Rue Saint-Dominique-D&rsquo;Enfer,No. 17.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion.</p><p>&ldquo;Wife!&rdquo; he cried.</p><p>The Thénardier woman hastened to him.</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the letter. You know what you have to do. There is a carriage atthe door. Set out at once, and return ditto.&rdquo;</p><p>And addressing the man with the meat-axe:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Since you have taken off your nose-screen, accompany the mistress. Youwill get up behind the fiacre. You know where you left the team?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man.</p><p>And depositing his axe in a corner, he followed Madame Thénardier.</p><p>As they set off, Thénardier thrust his head through the half-open door,and shouted into the corridor:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Above all things, don&rsquo;t lose the letter! remember that you carry twohundred thousand francs with you!&rdquo;</p><p>The Thénardier&rsquo;s hoarse voice replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Be easy. I have it in my bosom.&rdquo;</p><p>A minute had not elapsed, when the sound of the cracking of a whip washeard, which rapidly retreated and died away.</p><p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; growled Thénardier. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going at a fine pace. At such agallop, the bourgeoise will be back inside three-quarters of an hour.&rdquo;</p><p>He drew a chair close to the fireplace, folding his arms, and presentinghis muddy boots to the brazier.</p><p>&ldquo;My feet are cold!&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Only five ruffians now remained in the den with Thénardier and theprisoner.</p><p>These men, through the black masks or paste which covered their faces, andmade of them, at fear&rsquo;s pleasure, charcoal-burners, negroes, or demons,had a stupid and gloomy air, and it could be felt that they perpetrated acrime like a bit of work, tranquilly, without either wrath or mercy, witha sort of ennui. They were crowded together in one corner like brutes, andremained silent.</p><p>Thénardier warmed his feet.</p><p>The prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity. A sombre calm hadsucceeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few momentsbefore.</p><p>The candle, on which a large &ldquo;stranger&rdquo; had formed, cast but a dim lightin the immense hovel, the brazier had grown dull, and all those monstrousheads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling.</p><p>No sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man,who was fast asleep.</p><p>Marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle.The enigma was more impenetrable than ever.</p><p>Who was this &ldquo;little one&rdquo; whom Thénardier had called the Lark? Was she his&ldquo;Ursule&rdquo;? The prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word, &ldquo;theLark,&rdquo; and had replied in the most natural manner in the world: &ldquo;I do notknow what you mean.&rdquo; On the other hand, the two letters U. F. wereexplained; they meant Urbain Fabre; and Ursule was no longer named Ursule.This was what Marius perceived most clearly of all.</p><p>A sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post, from which hewas observing and commanding this whole scene. There he stood, almostincapable of movement or reflection, as though annihilated by theabominable things viewed at such close quarters. He waited, in the hope ofsome incident, no matter of what nature, since he could not collect histhoughts and did not know upon what course to decide.</p><p>&ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if she is the Lark, I shall see her, for theThénardier woman is to bring her hither. That will be the end, and then Iwill give my life and my blood if necessary, but I will deliver her!Nothing shall stop me.&rdquo;</p><p>Nearly half an hour passed in this manner. Thénardier seemed to beabsorbed in gloomy reflections, the prisoner did not stir. Still, Mariusfancied that at intervals, and for the last few moments, he had heard afaint, dull noise in the direction of the prisoner.</p><p>All at once, Thénardier addressed the prisoner:</p><p>&ldquo;By the way, Monsieur Fabre, I might as well say it to you at once.&rdquo;</p><p>These few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation. Mariusstrained his ears.</p><p>&ldquo;My wife will be back shortly, don&rsquo;t get impatient. I think that the Larkreally is your daughter, and it seems to me quite natural that you shouldkeep her. Only, listen to me a bit. My wife will go and hunt her up withyour letter. I told my wife to dress herself in the way she did, so thatyour young lady might make no difficulty about following her. They willboth enter the carriage with my comrade behind. Somewhere, outside thebarrier, there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses. Your younglady will be taken to it. She will alight from the fiacre. My comrade willenter the other vehicle with her, and my wife will come back here to tellus: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s done.&rsquo; As for the young lady, no harm will be done to her; thetrap will conduct her to a place where she will be quiet, and just as soonas you have handed over to me those little two hundred thousand francs,she will be returned to you. If you have me arrested, my comrade will givea turn of his thumb to the Lark, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p><p>The prisoner uttered not a syllable. After a pause, Thénardier continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple, as you see. There&rsquo;ll be no harm done unless you wishthat there should be harm done. I&rsquo;m telling you how things stand. I warnyou so that you may be prepared.&rdquo;</p><p>He paused: the prisoner did not break the silence, and Thénardier resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;As soon as my wife returns and says to me: &lsquo;The Lark is on the way,&rsquo; wewill release you, and you will be free to go and sleep at home. You seethat our intentions are not evil.&rdquo;</p><p>Terrible images passed through Marius&rsquo; mind. What! That young girl whomthey were abducting was not to be brought back? One of those monsters wasto bear her off into the darkness? Whither? And what if it were she!</p><p>It was clear that it was she. Marius felt his heart stop beating.</p><p>What was he to do? Discharge the pistol? Place all those scoundrels in thehands of justice? But the horrible man with the meat-axe would, nonetheless,be out of reach with the young girl, and Marius reflected onThénardier&rsquo;s words, of which he perceived the bloody significance: &ldquo;If youhave me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark.&rdquo;</p><p>Now, it was not alone by the colonel&rsquo;s testament, it was by his own love,it was by the peril of the one he loved, that he felt himself restrained.</p><p>This frightful situation, which had already lasted above half an hour, waschanging its aspect every moment.</p><p>Marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all themost heart-breaking conjectures, seeking hope and finding none.</p><p>The tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of theden.</p><p>In the midst of this silence, the door at the bottom of the staircase washeard to open and shut again.</p><p>The prisoner made a movement in his bonds.</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the bourgeoise,&rdquo; said Thénardier.</p><p>He had hardly uttered the words, when the Thénardier woman did in factrush hastily into the room, red, panting, breathless, with flaming eyes,and cried, as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;False address!&rdquo;</p><p>The ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her andpicked up his axe again.</p><p>She resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody there! Rue Saint-Dominique, No. 17, no Monsieur Urbain Fabre! Theyknow not what it means!&rdquo;</p><p>She paused, choking, then went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Thénardier! That old fellow has duped you! You are too good, yousee! If it had been me, I&rsquo;d have chopped the beast in four quarters tobegin with! And if he had acted ugly, I&rsquo;d have boiled him alive! He wouldhave been obliged to speak, and say where the girl is, and where he keepshis shiners! That&rsquo;s the way I should have managed matters! People areperfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider than women!Nobody at No. 17. It&rsquo;s nothing but a big carriage gate! No Monsieur Fabrein the Rue Saint-Dominique! And after all that racing and fee to thecoachman and all! I spoke to both the porter and the portress, a fine,stout woman, and they know nothing about him!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius breathed freely once more.</p><p>She, Ursule or the Lark, he no longer knew what to call her, was safe.</p><p>While his exasperated wife vociferated, Thénardier had seated himself onthe table.</p><p>For several minutes he uttered not a word, but swung his right foot, whichhung down, and stared at the brazier with an air of savage reverie.</p><p>Finally, he said to the prisoner, with a slow and singularly ferocioustone:</p><p>&ldquo;A false address? What did you expect to gain by that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To gain time!&rdquo; cried the prisoner in a thundering voice, and at the sameinstant he shook off his bonds; they were cut. The prisoner was onlyattached to the bed now by one leg.</p><p>Before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward, hehad bent down into the fireplace, had stretched out his hand to thebrazier, and had then straightened himself up again, and now Thénardier,the female Thénardier, and the ruffians, huddled in amazement at theextremity of the hovel, stared at him in stupefaction, as almost free andin a formidable attitude, he brandished above his head the red-hot chisel,which emitted a threatening glow.</p><p>The judicial examination to which the ambush in the Gorbeau houseeventually gave rise, established the fact that a large sou piece, cut andworked in a peculiar fashion, was found in the garret, when the policemade their descent on it. This sou piece was one of those marvels ofindustry, which are engendered by the patience of the galleys in theshadows and for the shadows, marvels which are nothing else thaninstruments of escape. These hideous and delicate products of wonderfulart are to jewellers&rsquo; work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry.There are Benvenuto Cellinis in the galleys, just as there are Villons inlanguage. The unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds meanssometimes without tools, sometimes with a common wooden-handled knife, tosaw a sou into two thin plates, to hollow out these plates withoutaffecting the coinage stamp, and to make a furrow on the edge of the souin such a manner that the plates will adhere again. This can be screwedtogether and unscrewed at will; it is a box. In this box he hides awatch-spring, and this watch-spring, properly handled, cuts good-sizedchains and bars of iron. The unfortunate convict is supposed to possessmerely a sou; not at all, he possesses liberty. It was a large sou of thissort which, during the subsequent search of the police, was found underthe bed near the window. They also found a tiny saw of blue steel whichwould fit the sou.</p><p>It is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at themoment when the ruffians searched him, that he contrived to conceal it inhis hand, and that afterward, having his right hand free, he unscrewed it,and used it as a saw to cut the cords which fastened him, which wouldexplain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements which Mariushad observed.</p><p>As he had not been able to bend down, for fear of betraying himself, hehad not cut the bonds of his left leg.</p><p>The ruffians had recovered from their first surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;Be easy,&rdquo; said Bigrenaille to Thénardier. &ldquo;He still holds by one leg, andhe can&rsquo;t get away. I&rsquo;ll answer for that. I tied that paw for him.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meanwhile, the prisoner had begun to speak:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You are wretches, but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it.When you think that you can make me speak, that you can make me write whatI do not choose to write, that you can make me say what I do not choose tosay&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>He stripped up his left sleeve, and added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;See here.&rdquo;</p><p>At the same moment he extended his arm, and laid the glowing chisel whichhe held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh.</p><p>The crackling of the burning flesh became audible, and the odor peculiarto chambers of torture filled the hovel.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0027" id="linkimage-0027"></a><img src="images/3b8-20-red-hot-chisel.jpg" alt="Red Hot Chisel" width="100%" /></div><p>Marius reeled in utter horror, the very ruffians shuddered, hardly amuscle of the old man&rsquo;s face contracted, and while the red-hot iron sankinto the smoking wound, impassive and almost august, he fixed onThénardier his beautiful glance, in which there was no hatred, and wheresuffering vanished in serene majesty.</p><p>With grand and lofty natures, the revolts of the flesh and the senses whensubjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth, and makeit appear on the brow, just as rebellions among the soldiery force thecaptain to show himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Wretches!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have no more fear of me than I have for you!&rdquo;</p><p>And, tearing the chisel from the wound, he hurled it through the window,which had been left open; the horrible, glowing tool disappeared into thenight, whirling as it flew, and fell far away on the snow.</p><p>The prisoner resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do what you please with me.&rdquo; He was disarmed.</p><p>&ldquo;Seize him!&rdquo; said Thénardier.</p><p>Two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder, and the masked manwith the ventriloquist&rsquo;s voice took up his station in front of him, readyto smash his skull at the slightest movement.</p><p>At the same time, Marius heard below him, at the base of the partition,but so near that he could not see who was speaking, this colloquyconducted in a low tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There is only one thing left to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cut his throat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p><p>It was the husband and wife taking counsel together.</p><p>Thénardier walked slowly towards the table, opened the drawer, and tookout the knife. Marius fretted with the handle of his pistol. Unprecedentedperplexity! For the last hour he had had two voices in his conscience, theone enjoining him to respect his father&rsquo;s testament, the other crying tohim to rescue the prisoner. These two voices continued uninterruptedlythat struggle which tormented him to agony. Up to that moment he hadcherished a vague hope that he should find some means of reconciling thesetwo duties, but nothing within the limits of possibility had presenteditself.</p><p>However, the peril was urgent, the last bounds of delay had been reached;Thénardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from theprisoner.</p><p>Marius cast a wild glance about him, the last mechanical resource ofdespair. All at once a shudder ran through him.</p><p>At his feet, on the table, a bright ray of light from the full moonilluminated and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper. On this paperhe read the following line written that very morning, in large letters, bythe eldest of the Thénardier girls:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;THE BOBBIES ARE HERE.&rdquo;</p><p>An idea, a flash, crossed Marius&rsquo; mind; this was the expedient of which hewas in search, the solution of that frightful problem which was torturinghim, of sparing the assassin and saving the victim.</p><p>He knelt down on his commode, stretched out his arm, seized the sheet ofpaper, softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall, wrapped the paperround it, and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of theden.</p><p>It was high time. Thénardier had conquered his last fears or his lastscruples, and was advancing on the prisoner.</p><p>&ldquo;Something is falling!&rdquo; cried the Thénardier woman.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked her husband.</p><p>The woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster. She handed itto her husband.</p><p>&ldquo;Where did this come from?&rdquo; demanded Thénardier.</p><p>&ldquo;Pardie!&rdquo; ejaculated his wife, &ldquo;where do you suppose it came from? Throughthe window, of course.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I saw it pass,&rdquo; said Bigrenaille.</p><p>Thénardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in Éponine&rsquo;s handwriting. The devil!&rdquo;</p><p>He made a sign to his wife, who hastily drew near, and showed her the linewritten on the sheet of paper, then he added in a subdued voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Quick! The ladder! Let&rsquo;s leave the bacon in the mousetrap and decamp!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Without cutting that man&rsquo;s throat?&rdquo; asked, the Thénardier woman.</p><p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t the time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Through what?&rdquo; resumed Bigrenaille.</p><p>&ldquo;Through the window,&rdquo; replied Thénardier. &ldquo;Since Ponine has thrown thestone through the window, it indicates that the house is not watched onthat side.&rdquo;</p><p>The mask with the ventriloquist&rsquo;s voice deposited his huge key on thefloor, raised both arms in the air, and opened and clenched his fists,three times rapidly without uttering a word.</p><p>This was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action onboard ship.</p><p>The ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him; in the twinklingof an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window, and solidlyfastened to the sill by the two iron hooks.</p><p>The prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him. He seemedto be dreaming or praying.</p><p>As soon as the ladder was arranged, Thénardier cried:</p><p>&ldquo;Come! the bourgeoise first!&rdquo;</p><p>And he rushed headlong to the window.</p><p>But just as he was about to throw his leg over, Bigrenaille seized himroughly by the collar.</p><p>&ldquo;Not much, come now, you old dog, after us!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After us!&rdquo; yelled the ruffians.</p><p>&ldquo;You are children,&rdquo; said Thénardier, &ldquo;we are losing time. The police areon our heels.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the ruffians, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s draw lots to see who shall go downfirst.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you mad! Are you crazy! What a pack of boobies! You want to wastetime, do you? Draw lots, do you? By a wet finger, by a short straw! Withwritten names! Thrown into a hat!&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like my hat?&rdquo; cried a voice on the threshold.</p><p>All wheeled round.

He had begun operationsby opening &ldquo;his pockets,&rdquo; and dropping into it the two young girls whowere charged with keeping a watch on the approaches to the den. But he hadonly &ldquo;caged&rdquo; Azelma. As for Éponine, she was not at her post, she haddisappeared, and he had not been able to seize her. Then Javert had made apoint and had bent his ear to waiting for the signal agreed upon. Thecomings and goings of the fiacres had greatly agitated him. At last, hehad grown impatient, and, <i>sure that there was a nest there</i>, sure ofbeing in &ldquo;luck,&rdquo; having recognized many of the ruffians who had entered,he had finally decided to go upstairs without waiting for the pistol-shot.</p><p>It will be remembered that he had Marius&rsquo; pass-key.</p><p>He had arrived just in the nick of time.</p><p>The terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they hadabandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight. In less than asecond, these seven men, horrible to behold, had grouped themselves in anattitude of defence, one with his meat-axe, another with his key, anotherwith his bludgeon, the rest with shears, pincers, and hammers. Thénardierhad his knife in his fist. The Thénardier woman snatched up an enormouspaving-stone which lay in the angle of the window and served her daughtersas an ottoman.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0028" id="linkimage-0028"></a><img src="images/3b8-21-paving-stone.jpg" alt="Snatched up a Paving Stone" width="100%" /></div><p>Javert put on his hat again, and advanced a couple of paces into the room,with arms folded, his cane under one arm, his sword in its sheath.</p><p>&ldquo;Halt there,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You shall not go out by the window, you shall gothrough the door.

The pistol missed fire.</p><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so!&rdquo; ejaculated Javert.</p><p>Bigrenaille flung his bludgeon at Javert&rsquo;s feet.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the emperor of the fiends!

They pinioned the ruffians.</p><p>This throng of men, sparely lighted by the single candle, filled the denwith shadows.</p><p>&ldquo;Handcuff them all!&rdquo; shouted Javert.</p><p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; cried a voice which was not the voice of a man, but of which noone would ever have said: &ldquo;It is a woman&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo;</p><p>The Thénardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of thewindow, and it was she who had just given vent to this roar.</p><p>The policemen and agents recoiled.</p><p>She had thrown off her shawl, but retained her bonnet; her husband, whowas crouching behind her, was almost hidden under the discarded shawl, andshe was shielding him with her body, as she elevated the paving-stoneabove her head with the gesture of a giantess on the point of hurling arock.</p><p>&ldquo;Beware!&rdquo; she shouted.</p><p>All crowded back towards the corridor. A broad open space was cleared inthe middle of the garret.</p><p>The Thénardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowedthemselves to be pinioned, and muttered in hoarse and guttural accents:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The cowards!&rdquo;</p><p>Javert smiled, and advanced across the open space which the Thénardier wasdevouring with her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come near me,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll crush you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What a grenadier!&rdquo; ejaculated Javert; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got a beard like a man,mother, but I have claws like a woman.&rdquo;</p><p>And he continued to advance.</p><p>The Thénardier, dishevelled and terrible, set her feet far apart, threwherself backwards, and hurled the paving-stone at Javert&rsquo;s head.

These two years rise like two mountains midway between thosewhich precede and those which follow them. They have a revolutionarygrandeur. Precipices are to be distinguished there. The social masses, thevery assizes of civilization, the solid group of superposed and adheringinterests, the century-old profiles of the ancient French formation,appear and disappear in them every instant, athwart the storm clouds ofsystems, of passions, and of theories. These appearances anddisappearances have been designated as movement and resistance. Atintervals, truth, that daylight of the human soul, can be descried shiningthere.</p><p>This remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to besufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principal lineseven at the present day.</p><p>We shall make the attempt.</p><p>The Restoration had been one of those intermediate phases, hard to define,in which there is fatigue, buzzing, murmurs, sleep, tumult, and which arenothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a halting-place.</p><p>These epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire toconvert them to profit. In the beginning, the nation asks nothing butrepose; it thirsts for but one thing, peace; it has but one ambition, tobe small. Which is the translation of remaining tranquil. Of great events,great hazards, great adventures, great men, thank God, we have seenenough, we have them heaped higher than our heads. We would exchange Cæsarfor Prusias, and Napoleon for the King of Yvetot. &ldquo;What a good little kingwas he!&rdquo; We have marched since daybreak, we have reached the evening of along and toilsome day; we have made our first change with Mirabeau, thesecond with Robespierre, the third with Bonaparte; we are worn out. Eachone demands a bed.</p><p>Devotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions which aresated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, solicit, what? Ashelter. They have it. They take possession of peace, of tranquillity, ofleisure; behold, they are content. But, at the same time certain facts arise,compel recognition, and knock at the door in their turn. These facts are theproducts of revolutions and wars, they are, they exist, they have the right toinstall themselves in society, and they do install themselves therein; and mostof the time, facts are the stewards of the household andfouriers<a href="#linknote-32" name="linknoteref-32" id="linknoteref-32">32</a>who do nothing but prepare lodgings for principles.</p><p>This, then, is what appears to philosophical politicians:&mdash;</p><p>At the same time that weary men demand repose, accomplished facts demandguarantees. Guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men.</p><p>This is what England demanded of the Stuarts after the Protector; this iswhat France demanded of the Bourbons after the Empire.</p><p>These guarantees are a necessity of the times. They must be accorded.Princes &ldquo;grant&rdquo; them, but in reality, it is the force of things whichgives them. A profound truth, and one useful to know, which the Stuartsdid not suspect in 1662 and which the Bourbons did not even obtain aglimpse of in 1814.</p><p>The predestined family, which returned to France when Napoleon fell, hadthe fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed, andthat what it had bestowed it could take back again; that the House ofBourbon possessed the right divine, that France possessed nothing, andthat the political right conceded in the charter of Louis XVIII. wasmerely a branch of the right divine, was detached by the House of Bourbonand graciously given to the people until such day as it should please theKing to reassume it. Still, the House of Bourbon should have felt, fromthe displeasure created by the gift, that it did not come from it.</p><p>This house was churlish to the nineteenth century. It put on anill-tempered look at every development of the nation. To make use of atrivial word, that is to say, of a popular and a true word, it lookedglum. The people saw this.</p><p>It thought it possessed strength because the Empire had been carried awaybefore it like a theatrical stage-setting. It did not perceive that ithad, itself, been brought in in the same fashion. It did not perceive thatit also lay in that hand which had removed Napoleon.</p><p>It thought that it had roots, because it was the past. It was mistaken; itformed a part of the past, but the whole past was France. The roots ofFrench society were not fixed in the Bourbons, but in the nations. Theseobscure and lively roots constituted, not the right of a family, but thehistory of a people. They were everywhere, except under the throne.</p><p>The House of Bourbon was to France the illustrious and bleeding knot inher history, but was no longer the principal element of her destiny, andthe necessary base of her politics. She could get along without theBourbons; she had done without them for two and twenty years; there hadbeen a break of continuity; they did not suspect the fact. And how shouldthey have suspected it, they who fancied that Louis XVII. reigned on the9th of Thermidor, and that Louis XVIII. was reigning at the battle ofMarengo? Never, since the origin of history, had princes been so blind inthe presence of facts and the portion of divine authority which factscontain and promulgate. Never had that pretension here below which iscalled the right of kings denied to such a point the right from on high.</p><p>A capital error which led this family to lay its hand once more on theguarantees &ldquo;granted&rdquo; in 1814, on the concessions, as it termed them. Sad.A sad thing! What it termed its concessions were our conquests; what ittermed our encroachments were our rights.</p><p>When the hour seemed to it to have come, the Restoration, supposing itselfvictorious over Bonaparte and well-rooted in the country, that is to say,believing itself to be strong and deep, abruptly decided on its plan ofaction, and risked its stroke. One morning it drew itself up before theface of France, and, elevating its voice, it contested the collectivetitle and the individual right of the nation to sovereignty, of thecitizen to liberty. In other words, it denied to the nation that whichmade it a nation, and to the citizen that which made him a citizen.</p><p>This is the foundation of those famous acts which are called theordinances of July. The Restoration fell.</p><p>It fell justly. But, we admit, it had not been absolutely hostile to allforms of progress. Great things had been accomplished, with it alongside.</p><p>Under the Restoration, the nation had grown accustomed to calm discussion,which had been lacking under the Republic, and to grandeur in peace, whichhad been wanting under the Empire. France free and strong had offered anencouraging spectacle to the other peoples of Europe. The Revolution hadhad the word under Robespierre; the cannon had had the word underBonaparte; it was under Louis XVIII. and Charles X. that it was the turnof intelligence to have the word. The wind ceased, the torch was lightedonce more. On the lofty heights, the pure light of mind could be seenflickering. A magnificent, useful, and charming spectacle. For a space offifteen years, those great principles which are so old for the thinker, sonew for the statesman, could be seen at work in perfect peace, on thepublic square; equality before the law, liberty of conscience, liberty ofspeech, liberty of the press, the accessibility of all aptitudes to allfunctions. Thus it proceeded until 1830. The Bourbons were an instrumentof civilization which broke in the hands of Providence.</p><p>The fall of the Bourbons was full of grandeur, not on their side, but onthe side of the nation. They quitted the throne with gravity, but withoutauthority; their descent into the night was not one of those solemndisappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history; it was neither thespectral calm of Charles I., nor the eagle scream of Napoleon. Theydeparted, that is all. They laid down the crown, and retained no aureole.They were worthy, but they were not august. They lacked, in a certainmeasure, the majesty of their misfortune. Charles X. during the voyagefrom Cherbourg, causing a round table to be cut over into a square table,appeared to be more anxious about imperilled etiquette than about thecrumbling monarchy. This diminution saddened devoted men who loved theirpersons, and serious men who honored their race. The populace wasadmirable. The nation, attacked one morning with weapons, by a sort ofroyal insurrection, felt itself in the possession of so much force that itdid not go into a rage. It defended itself, restrained itself, restoredthings to their places, the government to law, the Bourbons to exile,alas! and then halted! It took the old king Charles X. from beneath thatdais which had sheltered Louis XIV. and set him gently on the ground. Ittouched the royal personages only with sadness and precaution. It was notone man, it was not a few men, it was France, France entire, Francevictorious and intoxicated with her victory, who seemed to be coming toherself, and who put into practice, before the eyes of the whole world,these grave words of Guillaume du Vair after the day of the Barricades:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors of the great,and to spring, like a bird from bough to bough, from an afflicted fortuneto a flourishing one, to show themselves harsh towards their Prince in hisadversity; but as for me, the fortune of my Kings and especially of myafflicted Kings, will always be venerable to me.&rdquo;</p><p>The Bourbons carried away with them respect, but not regret. As we havejust stated, their misfortune was greater than they were. They faded outin the horizon.</p><p>The Revolution of July instantly had friends and enemies throughout theentire world. The first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm, theothers turned away, each according to his nature. At the first blush, theprinces of Europe, the owls of this dawn, shut their eyes, wounded andstupefied, and only opened them to threaten. A fright which can becomprehended, a wrath which can be pardoned. This strange revolution hadhardly produced a shock; it had not even paid to vanquished royalty thehonor of treating it as an enemy, and of shedding its blood. In the eyesof despotic governments, who are always interested in having libertycalumniate itself, the Revolution of July committed the fault of beingformidable and of remaining gentle. Nothing, however, was attempted orplotted against it. The most discontented, the most irritated, the mosttrembling, saluted it; whatever our egotism and our rancor may be, amysterious respect springs from events in which we are sensible of thecollaboration of some one who is working above man.</p><p>The Revolution of July is the triumph of right overthrowing the fact. Athing which is full of splendor.</p><p>Right overthrowing the fact. Hence the brilliancy of the Revolution of1830, hence, also, its mildness. Right triumphant has no need of beingviolent.</p><p>Right is the just and the true.</p><p>The property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure. The fact,even when most necessary to all appearances, even when most thoroughlyaccepted by contemporaries, if it exist only as a fact, and if it containonly too little of right, or none at all, is infallibly destined tobecome, in the course of time, deformed, impure, perhaps, even monstrous.If one desires to learn at one blow, to what degree of hideousness thefact can attain, viewed at the distance of centuries, let him look atMachiavelli. Machiavelli is not an evil genius, nor a demon, nor amiserable and cowardly writer; he is nothing but the fact. And he is notonly the Italian fact; he is the European fact, the fact of the sixteenthcentury. He seems hideous, and so he is, in the presence of the moral ideaof the nineteenth.</p><p>This conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since the origin ofsociety. To terminate this duel, to amalgamate the pure idea with thehumane reality, to cause right to penetrate pacifically into the fact andthe fact into right, that is the task of sages.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0224" id="link2HCH0224"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;BADLY SEWED</h3><p>But the task of sages is one thing, the task of clever men is another. TheRevolution of 1830 came to a sudden halt.</p><p>As soon as a revolution has made the coast, the skilful make haste toprepare the shipwreck.</p><p>The skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title ofStatesmen; so that this word, <i>statesmen</i>, has ended by becoming somewhat ofa slang word. It must be borne in mind, in fact, that wherever there isnothing but skill, there is necessarily pettiness. To say &ldquo;the skilful&rdquo; amounts to saying &ldquo;the mediocre.&rdquo;</p><p>In the same way, to say &ldquo;statesmen&rdquo; is sometimes equivalent to saying&ldquo;traitors.&rdquo; If, then, we are to believe the skilful, revolutions like theRevolution of July are severed arteries; a prompt ligature isindispensable. The right, too grandly proclaimed, is shaken. Also, rightonce firmly fixed, the state must be strengthened. Liberty once assured,attention must be directed to power.</p><p>Here the sages are not, as yet, separated from the skilful, but they beginto be distrustful. Power, very good. But, in the first place, what ispower? In the second, whence comes it? The skilful do not seem to hear themurmured objection, and they continue their manœuvres.</p><p>According to the politicians, who are ingenious in putting the mask ofnecessity on profitable fictions, the first requirement of a people aftera revolution, when this people forms part of a monarchical continent, isto procure for itself a dynasty. In this way, say they, peace, that is tosay, time to dress our wounds, and to repair the house, can be had after arevolution. The dynasty conceals the scaffolding and covers the ambulance.Now, it is not always easy to procure a dynasty.</p><p>If it is absolutely necessary, the first man of genius or even the firstman of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing of a king.You have, in the first case, Napoleon; in the second, Iturbide.</p><p>But the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make adynasty. There is necessarily required a certain modicum of antiquity in arace, and the wrinkle of the centuries cannot be improvised.</p><p>If we place ourselves at the point of view of the &ldquo;statesmen,&rdquo; aftermaking all allowances, of course, after a revolution, what are thequalities of the king which result from it? He may be and it is useful forhim to be a revolutionary; that is to say, a participant in his own personin that revolution, that he should have lent a hand to it, that he shouldhave either compromised or distinguished himself therein, that he shouldhave touched the axe or wielded the sword in it.</p><p>What are the qualities of a dynasty? It should be national; that is tosay, revolutionary at a distance, not through acts committed, but byreason of ideas accepted. It should be composed of past and be historic;be composed of future and be sympathetic.</p><p>All this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves withfinding a man, Cromwell or Napoleon; and why the second absolutelyinsisted on finding a family, the House of Brunswick or the House ofOrleans.</p><p>Royal houses resemble those Indian fig-trees, each branch of which,bending over to the earth, takes root and becomes a fig-tree itself. Eachbranch may become a dynasty. On the sole condition that it shall bend downto the people.</p><p>Such is the theory of the skilful.</p><p>Here, then, lies the great art: to make a little render to success thesound of a catastrophe in order that those who profit by it may tremblefrom it also, to season with fear every step that is taken, to augment thecurve of the transition to the point of retarding progress, to dull thataurora, to denounce and retrench the harshness of enthusiasm, to cut allangles and nails, to wad triumph, to muffle up right, to envelop thegiant-people in flannel, and to put it to bed very speedily, to impose adiet on that excess of health, to put Hercules on the treatment of aconvalescent, to dilute the event with the expedient, to offer to spiritsthirsting for the ideal that nectar thinned out with a potion, to takeone&rsquo;s precautions against too much success, to garnish the revolution witha shade.</p><p>1830 practised this theory, already applied to England by 1688.</p><p>1830 is a revolution arrested midway. Half of progress, quasi-right. Now,logic knows not the &ldquo;almost,&rdquo; absolutely as the sun knows not the candle.</p><p>Who arrests revolutions half-way?

The bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of thepeople. The bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down. A chair isnot a caste.</p><p>But through a desire to sit down too soon, one may arrest the very marchof the human race. This has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie.</p><p>One is not a class because one has committed a fault. Selfishness is notone of the divisions of the social order.</p><p>Moreover, we must be just to selfishness. The state to which that part ofthe nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock of 1830was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference and laziness,and which contains a little shame; it was not the slumber whichpresupposes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams; it was thehalt.</p><p>The halt is a word formed of a singular double and almost contradictorysense: a troop on the march, that is to say, movement; a stand, that is tosay, repose.</p><p>The halt is the restoration of forces; it is repose armed and on thealert; it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels and holds itselfon its guard.</p><p>The halt presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat of to-morrow.</p><p>It is the partition between 1830 and 1848.</p><p>What we here call combat may also be designated as progress.</p><p>The bourgeoisie then, as well as the statesmen, required a man who shouldexpress this word Halt. An Although-Because.

Even incomplete, even debased and abused and reduced to thestate of a junior revolution like the Revolution of 1830, they nearlyalways retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent them fromfalling amiss. Their eclipse is never an abdication.</p><p>Nevertheless, let us not boast too loudly; revolutions also may bedeceived, and grave errors have been seen.</p><p>Let us return to 1830. 1830, in its deviation, had good luck. In theestablishment which entitled itself order after the revolution had beencut short, the King amounted to more than royalty. Louis Philippe was arare man.</p><p>The son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuatingcircumstances, but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been ofblame; possessing all private virtues and many public virtues; careful ofhis health, of his fortune, of his person, of his affairs, knowing thevalue of a minute and not always the value of a year; sober, serene,peaceable, patient; a good man and a good prince; sleeping with his wife,and having in his palace lackeys charged with the duty of showing theconjugal bed to the bourgeois, an ostentation of the regularsleeping-apartment which had become useful after the former illegitimatedisplays of the elder branch; knowing all the languages of Europe, and,what is more rare, all the languages of all interests, and speaking them;an admirable representative of the &ldquo;middle class,&rdquo; but outstripping it,and in every way greater than it; possessing excellent sense, whileappreciating the blood from which he had sprung, counting most of all onhis intrinsic worth, and, on the question of his race, very particular,declaring himself Orleans and not Bourbon; thoroughly the first Prince ofthe Blood Royal while he was still only a Serene Highness, but a frankbourgeois from the day he became king; diffuse in public, concise inprivate; reputed, but not proved to be a miser; at bottom, one of thoseeconomists who are readily prodigal at their own fancy or duty; lettered,but not very sensitive to letters; a gentleman, but not a chevalier;simple, calm, and strong; adored by his family and his household; afascinating talker, an undeceived statesman, inwardly cold, dominated byimmediate interest, always governing at the shortest range, incapable ofrancor and of gratitude, making use without mercy of superiority onmediocrity, clever in getting parliamentary majorities to put in the wrongthose mysterious unanimities which mutter dully under thrones; unreserved,sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve, but with marvellous address inthat imprudence; fertile in expedients, in countenances, in masks; makingFrance fear Europe and Europe France! Incontestably fond of his country,but preferring his family; assuming more domination than authority andmore authority than dignity, a disposition which has this unfortunateproperty, that as it turns everything to success, it admits of ruse anddoes not absolutely repudiate baseness, but which has this valuable side,that it preserves politics from violent shocks, the state from fractures,and society from catastrophes; minute, correct, vigilant, attentive,sagacious, indefatigable; contradicting himself at times and givinghimself the lie; bold against Austria at Ancona, obstinate against Englandin Spain, bombarding Antwerp, and paying off Pritchard; singing theMarseillaise with conviction, inaccessible to despondency, to lassitude,to the taste for the beautiful and the ideal, to daring generosity, toUtopia, to chimæras, to wrath, to vanity, to fear; possessing all theforms of personal intrepidity; a general at Valmy; a soldier at Jemappes;attacked eight times by regicides and always smiling. Brave as agrenadier, courageous as a thinker; uneasy only in the face of the chancesof a European shaking up, and unfitted for great political adventures;always ready to risk his life, never his work; disguising his will ininfluence, in order that he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather thanas a king; endowed with observation and not with divination; not veryattentive to minds, but knowing men, that is to say requiring to see inorder to judge; prompt and penetrating good sense, practical wisdom, easyspeech, prodigious memory; drawing incessantly on this memory, his onlypoint of resemblance with Cæsar, Alexander, and Napoleon; knowing deeds,facts, details, dates, proper names, ignorant of tendencies, passions, thediverse geniuses of the crowd, the interior aspirations, the hidden andobscure uprisings of souls, in a word, all that can be designated as theinvisible currents of consciences; accepted by the surface, but little inaccord with France lower down; extricating himself by dint of tact;governing too much and not enough; his own first minister; excellent atcreating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity ofideas; mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization, of order andorganization, an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery, thefounder and lawyer of a dynasty; having something of Charlemagne andsomething of an attorney; in short, a lofty and original figure, a princewho understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness ofFrance, and power in spite of the jealousy of Europe. Louis Philippe willbe classed among the eminent men of his century, and would be ranked amongthe most illustrious governors of history had he loved glory but a little,and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree as thefeeling for what is useful.</p><p>Louis Philippe had been handsome, and in his old age he remained graceful;not always approved by the nation, he always was so by the masses; hepleased. He had that gift of charming. He lacked majesty; he wore nocrown, although a king, and no white hair, although an old man; hismanners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the new; a mixture ofthe noble and the bourgeois which suited 1830; Louis Philippe wastransition reigning; he had preserved the ancient pronunciation and theancient orthography which he placed at the service of opinions modern; heloved Poland and Hungary, but he wrote <i>les Polonois</i>, and he pronounced <i>lesHongrais</i>. He wore the uniform of the national guard, like Charles X., andthe ribbon of the Legion of Honor, like Napoleon.</p><p>He went a little to chapel, not at all to the chase, never to the opera.Incorruptible by sacristans, by whippers-in, by ballet-dancers; this madea part of his bourgeois popularity. He had no heart. He went out with hisumbrella under his arm, and this umbrella long formed a part of hisaureole. He was a bit of a mason, a bit of a gardener, something of adoctor; he bled a postilion who had tumbled from his horse; Louis Philippeno more went about without his lancet, than did Henri IV. without hisponiard. The Royalists jeered at this ridiculous king, the first who hadever shed blood with the object of healing.</p><p>For the grievances against Louis Philippe, there is one deduction to bemade; there is that which accuses royalty, that which accuses the reign,that which accuses the King; three columns which all give differenttotals. Democratic right confiscated, progress becomes a matter ofsecondary interest, the protests of the street violently repressed,military execution of insurrections, the rising passed over by arms, theRue Transnonain, the counsels of war, the absorption of the real countryby the legal country, on half shares with three hundred thousandprivileged persons,&mdash;these are the deeds of royalty; Belgium refused,Algeria too harshly conquered, and, as in the case of India by theEnglish, with more barbarism than civilization, the breach of faith, toAbd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz bought, Pritchard paid,&mdash;these are thedoings of the reign; the policy which was more domestic than national wasthe doing of the King.</p><p>As will be seen, the proper deduction having been made, the King&rsquo;s chargeis decreased.</p><p>This is his great fault; he was modest in the name of France.</p><p>Whence arises this fault?</p><p>We will state it.</p><p>Louis Philippe was rather too much of a paternal king; that incubation ofa family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of everything anddoes not like to be disturbed; hence excessive timidity, which isdispleasing to the people, who have the 14th of July in their civil andAusterlitz in their military tradition.</p><p>Moreover, if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilledfirst of all, that deep tenderness of Louis Philippe towards his familywas deserved by the family. That domestic group was worthy of admiration.Virtues there dwelt side by side with talents. One of Louis Philippe&rsquo;sdaughters, Marie d&rsquo;Orleans, placed the name of her race among artists, asCharles d&rsquo;Orleans had placed it among poets. She made of her soul a marblewhich she named Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc. Two of Louis Philippe&rsquo;s daughters elicitedfrom Metternich this eulogium: &ldquo;They are young people such as are rarelyseen, and princes such as are never seen.&rdquo;</p><p>This, without any dissimulation, and also without any exaggeration, is thetruth about Louis Philippe.</p><p>To be Prince Equality, to bear in his own person the contradiction of theRestoration and the Revolution, to have that disquieting side of therevolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power, therein lay thefortune of Louis Philippe in 1830; never was there a more completeadaptation of a man to an event; the one entered into the other, and theincarnation took place. Louis Philippe is 1830 made man. Moreover, he hadin his favor that great recommendation to the throne, exile. He had beenproscribed, a wanderer, poor. He had lived by his own labor. InSwitzerland, this heir to the richest princely domains in France had soldan old horse in order to obtain bread. At Reichenau, he gave lessons inmathematics, while his sister Adelaide did wool work and sewed. Thesesouvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie enthusiastic. Hehad, with his own hands, demolished the iron cage of Mont-Saint-Michel,built by Louis XI., and used by Louis XV. He was the companion ofDumouriez, he was the friend of Lafayette; he had belonged to theJacobins&rsquo; club; Mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder; Danton had saidto him: &ldquo;Young man!&rdquo; At the age of four and twenty, in &rsquo;93, being then M.de Chartres, he had witnessed, from the depth of a box, the trial of LouisXVI., so well named <i>that poor tyrant</i>. The blind clairvoyance of theRevolution, breaking royalty in the King and the King with royalty, did soalmost without noticing the man in the fierce crushing of the idea, thevast storm of the Assembly-Tribunal, the public wrath interrogating, Capetnot knowing what to reply, the alarming, stupefied vacillation by thatroyal head beneath that sombre breath, the relative innocence of all inthat catastrophe, of those who condemned as well as of the man condemned,&mdash;hehad looked on those things, he had contemplated that giddiness; he hadseen the centuries appear before the bar of the Assembly-Convention; hehad beheld, behind Louis XVI., that unfortunate passer-by who was maderesponsible, the terrible culprit, the monarchy, rise through the shadows;and there had lingered in his soul the respectful fear of these immensejustices of the populace, which are almost as impersonal as the justice ofGod.</p><p>The trace left in him by the Revolution was prodigious. Its memory waslike a living imprint of those great years, minute by minute. One day, inthe presence of a witness whom we are not permitted to doubt, he rectifiedfrom memory the whole of the letter A in the alphabetical list of theConstituent Assembly.</p><p>Louis Philippe was a king of the broad daylight. While he reigned thepress was free, the tribune was free, conscience and speech were free. Thelaws of September are open to sight. Although fully aware of the gnawingpower of light on privileges, he left his throne exposed to the light.History will do justice to him for this loyalty.</p><p>Louis Philippe, like all historical men who have passed from the scene, isto-day put on his trial by the human conscience. His case is, as yet, onlyin the lower court.</p><p>The hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent, has notyet sounded for him; the moment has not come to pronounce a definitejudgment on this king; the austere and illustrious historian Louis Blanchas himself recently softened his first verdict; Louis Philippe waselected by those two <i>almosts</i> which are called the 221 and 1830, that is tosay, by a half-Parliament, and a half-revolution; and in any case, fromthe superior point of view where philosophy must place itself, we cannotjudge him here, as the reader has seen above, except with certainreservations in the name of the absolute democratic principle; in the eyesof the absolute, outside these two rights, the right of man in the firstplace, the right of the people in the second, all is usurpation; but whatwe can say, even at the present day, that after making these reserves is,that to sum up the whole, and in whatever manner he is considered, LouisPhilippe, taken in himself, and from the point of view of human goodness,will remain, to use the antique language of ancient history, one of thebest princes who ever sat on a throne.</p><p>What is there against him? That throne. Take away Louis Philippe the king,there remains the man. And the man is good. He is good at times even tothe point of being admirable. Often, in the midst of his gravestsouvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of thecontinent, he returned at night to his apartments, and there, exhaustedwith fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do? He took a deathsentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit, considering itsomething to hold his own against Europe, but that it was a still greatermatter to rescue a man from the executioner. He obstinately maintained hisopinion against his keeper of the seals; he disputed the ground with theguillotine foot by foot against the crown attorneys, those <i>chatterers ofthe law</i>, as he called them. Sometimes the pile of sentences covered histable; he examined them all; it was anguish to him to abandon thesemiserable, condemned heads. One day, he said to the same witness to whomwe have recently referred: &ldquo;I won seven last night.&rdquo; During the earlyyears of his reign, the death penalty was as good as abolished, and theerection of a scaffold was a violence committed against the King. TheGrève having disappeared with the elder branch, a bourgeois place ofexecution was instituted under the name of the Barrière-Saint-Jacques;&ldquo;practical men&rdquo; felt the necessity of a quasi-legitimate guillotine; andthis was one of the victories of Casimir Périer, who represented thenarrow sides of the bourgeoisie, over Louis Philippe, who represented itsliberal sides. Louis Philippe annotated Beccaria with his own hand. Afterthe Fieschi machine, he exclaimed: &ldquo;What a pity that I was not wounded!Then I might have pardoned!&rdquo; On another occasion, alluding to theresistance offered by his ministry, he wrote in connection with apolitical criminal, who is one of the most generous figures of our day:&ldquo;His pardon is granted; it only remains for me to obtain it.&rdquo; LouisPhilippe was as gentle as Louis IX. and as kindly as Henri IV.</p><p>Now, to our mind, in history, where kindness is the rarest of pearls, theman who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great.</p><p>Louis Philippe having been severely judged by some, harshly, perhaps, byothers, it is quite natural that a man, himself a phantom at the presentday, who knew that king, should come and testify in his favor beforehistory; this deposition, whatever else it may be, is evidently and aboveall things, entirely disinterested; an epitaph penned by a dead man issincere; one shade may console another shade; the sharing of the sameshadows confers the right to praise it; it is not greatly to be fearedthat it will ever be said of two tombs in exile: &ldquo;This one flattered theother.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0226" id="link2HCH0226"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;CRACKS BENEATH THE FOUNDATION</h3><p>At the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point ofpenetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which envelop thebeginning of Louis Philippe&rsquo;s reign, it was necessary that there should beno equivoque, and it became requisite that this book should offer someexplanation with regard to this king.</p><p>Louis Philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority withoutviolence, without any direct action on his part, by virtue of arevolutionary change, evidently quite distinct from the real aim of theRevolution, but in which he, the Duc d&rsquo;Orléans, exercised no personalinitiative. He had been born a Prince, and he believed himself to havebeen elected King. He had not served this mandate on himself; he had nottaken it; it had been offered to him, and he had accepted it; convinced,wrongly, to be sure, but convinced nevertheless, that the offer was inaccordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in accordance withduty. Hence his possession was in good faith. Now, we say it in goodconscience, Louis Philippe being in possession in perfect good faith, andthe democracy being in good faith in its attack, the amount of terrordischarged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the King nor on thedemocracy. A clash of principles resembles a clash of elements. The oceandefends the water, the hurricane defends the air, the King defendsRoyalty, the democracy defends the people; the relative, which is themonarchy, resists the absolute, which is the republic; society bleeds inthis conflict, but that which constitutes its suffering to-day willconstitute its safety later on; and, in any case, those who combat are notto be blamed; one of the two parties is evidently mistaken; the right isnot, like the Colossus of Rhodes, on two shores at once, with one foot onthe republic, and one in Royalty; it is indivisible, and all on one side;but those who are in error are so sincerely; a blind man is no more acriminal than a Vendean is a ruffian. Let us, then, impute to the fatalityof things alone these formidable collisions. Whatever the nature of thesetempests may be, human irresponsibility is mingled with them.</p><p>Let us complete this exposition.</p><p>The government of 1840 led a hard life immediately. Born yesterday, it wasobliged to fight to-day.</p><p>Hardly installed, it was already everywhere conscious of vague movementsof traction on the apparatus of July so recently laid, and so lacking insolidity.</p><p>Resistance was born on the morrow; perhaps even, it was born on thepreceding evening. From month to month the hostility increased, and frombeing concealed it became patent.</p><p>The Revolution of July, which gained but little acceptance outside ofFrance by kings, had been diversely interpreted in France, as we havesaid.</p><p>God delivers over to men his visible will in events, an obscure textwritten in a mysterious tongue. Men immediately make translations of it;translations hasty, incorrect, full of errors, of gaps, and of nonsense.Very few minds comprehend the divine language. The most sagacious, thecalmest, the most profound, decipher slowly, and when they arrive withtheir text, the task has long been completed; there are already twentytranslations on the public place. From each remaining springs a party, andfrom each misinterpretation a faction; and each party thinks that it alonehas the true text, and each faction thinks that it possesses the light.</p><p>Power itself is often a faction.</p><p>There are, in revolutions, swimmers who go against the current; they arethe old parties.</p><p>For the old parties who clung to heredity by the grace of God, think thatrevolutions, having sprung from the right to revolt, one has the right torevolt against them. Error. For in these revolutions, the one who revoltsis not the people; it is the king. Revolution is precisely the contrary ofrevolt. Every revolution, being a normal outcome, contains within itselfits legitimacy, which false revolutionists sometimes dishonor, but whichremains even when soiled, which survives even when stained with blood.</p><p>Revolutions spring not from an accident, but from necessity. A revolutionis a return from the fictitious to the real. It is because it must be thatit is.</p><p>Nonetheless did the old legitimist parties assail the Revolution of 1830with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning. Errors makeexcellent projectiles. They strike it cleverly in its vulnerable spot, indefault of a cuirass, in its lack of logic; they attacked this revolutionin its royalty. They shouted to it: &ldquo;Revolution, why this king?&rdquo; Factionsare blind men who aim correctly.</p><p>This cry was uttered equally by the republicans. But coming from them,this cry was logical. What was blindness in the legitimists was clearnessof vision in the democrats. 1830 had bankrupted the people. The enrageddemocracy reproached it with this.</p><p>Between the attack of the past and the attack of the future, theestablishment of July struggled. It represented the minute at loggerheadson the one hand with the monarchical centuries, on the other hand witheternal right.</p><p>In addition, and beside all this, as it was no longer revolution and hadbecome a monarchy, 1830 was obliged to take precedence of all Europe. Tokeep the peace, was an increase of complication. A harmony establishedcontrary to sense is often more onerous than a war. From this secretconflict, always muzzled, but always growling, was born armed peace, thatruinous expedient of civilization which in the harness of the Europeancabinets is suspicious in itself. The Royalty of July reared up, in spiteof the fact that it caught it in the harness of European cabinets.Metternich would gladly have put it in kicking-straps. Pushed on in Franceby progress, it pushed on the monarchies, those loiterers in Europe. Afterhaving been towed, it undertook to tow.</p><p>Meanwhile, within her, pauperism, the proletariat, salary, education,penal servitude, prostitution, the fate of the woman, wealth, misery,production, consumption, division, exchange, coin, credit, the rights ofcapital, the rights of labor,&mdash;all these questions were multipliedabove society, a terrible slope.</p><p>Outside of political parties properly so called, another movement becamemanifest. Philosophical fermentation replied to democratic fermentation.The elect felt troubled as well as the masses; in another manner, butquite as much.</p><p>Thinkers meditated, while the soil, that is to say, the people, traversedby revolutionary currents, trembled under them with indescribably vagueepileptic shocks. These dreamers, some isolated, others united in familiesand almost in communion, turned over social questions in a pacific butprofound manner; impassive miners, who tranquilly pushed their galleriesinto the depths of a volcano, hardly disturbed by the dull commotion andthe furnaces of which they caught glimpses.</p><p>This tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of this agitatedepoch.</p><p>These men left to political parties the question of rights, they occupiedthemselves with the question of happiness.</p><p>The well-being of man, that was what they wanted to extract from society.</p><p>They raised material questions, questions of agriculture, of industry, ofcommerce, almost to the dignity of a religion. In civilization, such as ithas formed itself, a little by the command of God, a great deal by theagency of man, interests combine, unite, and amalgamate in a manner toform a veritable hard rock, in accordance with a dynamic law, patientlystudied by economists, those geologists of politics. These men who groupedthemselves under different appellations, but who may all be designated bythe generic title of socialists, endeavored to pierce that rock and tocause it to spout forth the living waters of human felicity.</p><p>From the question of the scaffold to the question of war, their worksembraced everything. To the rights of man, as proclaimed by the FrenchRevolution, they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child.</p><p>The reader will not be surprised if, for various reasons, we do not heretreat in a thorough manner, from the theoretical point of view, thequestions raised by socialism. We confine ourselves to indicating them.</p><p>All the problems that the socialists proposed to themselves, cosmogonicvisions, reverie and mysticism being cast aside, can be reduced to twoprincipal problems.</p><p>First problem: To produce wealth.</p><p>Second problem: To share it.</p><p>The first problem contains the question of work.</p><p>The second contains the question of salary.</p><p>In the first problem the employment of forces is in question.</p><p>In the second, the distribution of enjoyment.</p><p>From the proper employment of forces results public power.</p><p>From a good distribution of enjoyments results individual happiness.</p><p>By a good distribution, not an equal but an equitable distribution must beunderstood.</p><p>From these two things combined, the public power without, individualhappiness within, results social prosperity.</p><p>Social prosperity means the man happy, the citizen free, the nation great.</p><p>England solves the first of these two problems. She creates wealthadmirably, she divides it badly. This solution which is complete on oneside only leads her fatally to two extremes: monstrous opulence, monstrouswretchedness. All enjoyments for some, all privations for the rest, thatis to say, for the people; privilege, exception, monopoly, feudalism, bornfrom toil itself. A false and dangerous situation, which sates publicpower or private misery, which sets the roots of the State in thesufferings of the individual. A badly constituted grandeur in which arecombined all the material elements and into which no moral element enters.</p><p>Communism and agrarian law think that they solve the second problem. Theyare mistaken. Their division kills production. Equal partition abolishesemulation; and consequently labor. It is a partition made by the butcher,which kills that which it divides. It is therefore impossible to pauseover these pretended solutions. Slaying wealth is not the same thing asdividing it.</p><p>The two problems require to be solved together, to be well solved. The twoproblems must be combined and made but one.</p><p>Solve only the first of the two problems; you will be Venice, you will beEngland. You will have, like Venice, an artificial power, or, likeEngland, a material power; you will be the wicked rich man. You will dieby an act of violence, as Venice died, or by bankruptcy, as England willfall. And the world will allow to die and fall all that is merelyselfishness, all that does not represent for the human race either avirtue or an idea.</p><p>It is well understood here, that by the words Venice, England, wedesignate not the peoples, but social structures; the oligarchiessuperposed on nations, and not the nations themselves. The nations alwayshave our respect and our sympathy. Venice, as a people, will live again;England, the aristocracy, will fall, but England, the nation, is immortal.That said, we continue.</p><p>Solve the two problems, encourage the wealthy, and protect the poor,suppress misery, put an end to the unjust farming out of the feeble by thestrong, put a bridle on the iniquitous jealousy of the man who is makinghis way against the man who has reached the goal, adjust, mathematicallyand fraternally, salary to labor, mingle gratuitous and compulsoryeducation with the growth of childhood, and make of science the base ofmanliness, develop minds while keeping arms busy, be at one and the sametime a powerful people and a family of happy men, render propertydemocratic, not by abolishing it, but by making it universal, so thatevery citizen, without exception, may be a proprietor, an easier matterthan is generally supposed; in two words, learn how to produce wealth andhow to distribute it, and you will have at once moral and materialgreatness; and you will be worthy to call yourself France.</p><p>This is what socialism said outside and above a few sects which have goneastray; that is what it sought in facts, that is what it sketched out inminds.</p><p>Efforts worthy of admiration! Sacred attempts!</p><p>These doctrines, these theories, these resistances, the unforeseennecessity for the statesman to take philosophers into account, confusedevidences of which we catch a glimpse, a new system of politics to becreated, which shall be in accord with the old world without too muchdisaccord with the new revolutionary ideal, a situation in which it becamenecessary to use Lafayette to defend Polignac, the intuition of progresstransparent beneath the revolt, the chambers and streets, the competitionsto be brought into equilibrium around him, his faith in the Revolution,perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of the vague acceptanceof a superior definitive right, his desire to remain of his race, hisdomestic spirit, his sincere respect for the people, his own honesty,preoccupied Louis Philippe almost painfully, and there were moments whenstrong and courageous as he was, he was overwhelmed by the difficulties ofbeing a king.</p><p>He felt under his feet a formidable disaggregation, which was not,nevertheless, a reduction to dust, France being more France than ever.</p><p>Piles of shadows covered the horizon. A strange shade, gradually drawingnearer, extended little by little over men, over things, over ideas; ashade which came from wraths and systems. Everything which had beenhastily stifled was moving and fermenting. At times the conscience of thehonest man resumed its breathing, so great was the discomfort of that airin which sophisms were intermingled with truths. Spirits trembled in thesocial anxiety like leaves at the approach of a storm. The electrictension was such that at certain instants, the first comer, a stranger,brought light. Then the twilight obscurity closed in again. At intervals,deep and dull mutterings allowed a judgment to be formed as to thequantity of thunder contained by the cloud.</p><p>Twenty months had barely elapsed since the Revolution of July, the year1832 had opened with an aspect of something impending and threatening.</p><p>The distress of the people, the laborers without bread, the last Prince deCondé engulfed in the shadows, Brussels expelling the Nassaus as Paris didthe Bourbons, Belgium offering herself to a French Prince and givingherself to an English Prince, the Russian hatred of Nicolas, behind us thedemons of the South, Ferdinand in Spain, Miguel in Portugal, the earthquaking in Italy, Metternich extending his hand over Bologna, Francetreating Austria sharply at Ancona, at the North no one knew what sinistersound of the hammer nailing up Poland in her coffin, irritated glanceswatching France narrowly all over Europe, England, a suspected ally, readyto give a push to that which was tottering and to hurl herself on thatwhich should fall, the peerage sheltering itself behind Beccaria to refusefour heads to the law, the fleurs-de-lys erased from the King&rsquo;s carriage,the cross torn from Notre Dame, Lafayette lessened, Laffitte ruined,Benjamin Constant dead in indigence, Casimir Périer dead in the exhaustionof his power; political and social malady breaking out simultaneously inthe two capitals of the kingdom, the one in the city of thought, the otherin the city of toil; at Paris civil war, at Lyons servile war; in the twocities, the same glare of the furnace; a crater-like crimson on the browof the people; the South rendered fanatic, the West troubled, the Duchessede Berry in la Vendée, plots, conspiracies, risings, cholera, added thesombre roar of tumult of events to the sombre roar of ideas.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0227" id="link2HCH0227"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;FACTS WHENCE HISTORY SPRINGS AND WHICH HISTORY IGNORES</h3><p>Towards the end of April, everything had become aggravated. Thefermentation entered the boiling state. Ever since 1830, petty partialrevolts had been going on here and there, which were quickly suppressed,but ever bursting forth afresh, the sign of a vast underlyingconflagration. Something terrible was in preparation. Glimpses could becaught of the features still indistinct and imperfectly lighted, of apossible revolution. France kept an eye on Paris; Paris kept an eye on theFaubourg Saint-Antoine.</p><p>The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which was in a dull glow, was beginning itsebullition.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0031" id="linkimage-0031"></a><img alt="A Street Orator" src="images/4b1-5-street-orator.jpg" width="100%" /></div><p>The wine-shops of the Rue de Charonne were, although the union of the twoepithets seems singular when applied to wine-shops, grave and stormy.</p><p>The government was there purely and simply called in question. Therepeople publicly discussed the <i>question of fighting or of keeping quiet</i>.There were back shops where workingmen were made to swear that they wouldhasten into the street at the first cry of alarm, and &ldquo;that they wouldfight without counting the number of the enemy.&rdquo; This engagement onceentered into, a man seated in the corner of the wine-shop &ldquo;assumed asonorous tone,&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;You understand! You have sworn!&rdquo;</p><p>Sometimes they went upstairs, to a private room on the first floor, andthere scenes that were almost masonic were enacted. They made theinitiated take oaths <i>to render service to himself as well as to thefathers of families</i>. That was the formula.</p><p>In the tap-rooms, &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; pamphlets were read. <i>They treated thegovernment with contempt</i>, says a secret report of that time.</p><p>Words like the following could be heard there:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the names of the leaders. We folks shall not know the dayuntil two hours beforehand.&rdquo; One workman said: &ldquo;There are three hundred ofus, let each contribute ten sous, that will make one hundred and fiftyfrancs with which to procure powder and shot.&rdquo;</p><p>Another said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask for six months, I don&rsquo;t ask for even two. Inless than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government. Withtwenty-five thousand men we can face them.&rdquo; Another said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sleepat night, because I make cartridges all night.&rdquo; From time to time, men &ldquo;ofbourgeois appearance, and in good coats&rdquo; came and &ldquo;caused embarrassment,&rdquo; and with the air of &ldquo;command,&rdquo; shook hands with <i>the most important</i>, andthen went away. They never stayed more than ten minutes. Significantremarks were exchanged in a low tone: &ldquo;The plot is ripe, the matter isarranged.&rdquo; &ldquo;It was murmured by all who were there,&rdquo; to borrow the veryexpression of one of those who were present. The exaltation was such thatone day, a workingman exclaimed, before the whole wine-shop: &ldquo;We have noarms!&rdquo; One of his comrades replied: &ldquo;The soldiers have!&rdquo; thus parodyingwithout being aware of the fact, Bonaparte&rsquo;s proclamation to the army inItaly: &ldquo;When they had anything of a more secret nature on hand,&rdquo; adds onereport, &ldquo;they did not communicate it to each other.&rdquo; It is not easy tounderstand what they could conceal after what they said.</p><p>These reunions were sometimes periodical. At certain ones of them, therewere never more than eight or ten persons present, and they were alwaysthe same. In others, any one entered who wished, and the room was so fullthat they were forced to stand. Some went thither through enthusiasm andpassion; others because it <i>was on their way to their work</i>. As during theRevolution, there were patriotic women in some of these wine-shops whoembraced newcomers.</p><p>Other expressive facts came to light.</p><p>A man would enter a shop, drink, and go his way with the remark:&ldquo;Wine-merchant, the revolution will pay what is due to you.&rdquo;</p><p>Revolutionary agents were appointed in a wine-shop facing the Rue deCharonne. The balloting was carried on in their caps.</p><p>Workingmen met at the house of a fencing-master who gave lessons in theRue de Cotte. There there was a trophy of arms formed of woodenbroadswords, canes, clubs, and foils. One day, the buttons were removedfrom the foils.</p><p>A workman said: &ldquo;There are twenty-five of us, but they don&rsquo;t count on me,because I am looked upon as a machine.&rdquo; Later on, that machine becameQuenisset.</p><p>The indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired a strange andindescribable notoriety. A woman sweeping off her doorsteps said toanother woman: &ldquo;For a long time, there has been a strong force busy makingcartridges.&rdquo; In the open street, proclamation could be seen addressed tothe National Guard in the departments. One of these proclamations wassigned: <i>Burtot, wine-merchant</i>.</p><p>One day a man with his beard worn like a collar and with an Italian accentmounted a stone post at the door of a liquor-seller in the Marché Lenoir,and read aloud a singular document, which seemed to emanate from an occultpower. Groups formed around him, and applauded.</p><p>The passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected and noteddown. &ldquo;&mdash;Our doctrines are trammelled, our proclamations torn, ourbill-stickers are spied upon and thrown into prison.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The breakdownwhich has recently taken place in cottons has converted to us manymediums.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The future of nations is being worked out in our obscureranks.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Here are the fixed terms: action or reaction, revolution orcounter-revolution. For, at our epoch, we no longer believe either ininertia or in immobility. For the people against the people, that is thequestion. There is no other.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;On the day when we cease to suit you,break us, but up to that day, help us to march on.&rdquo; All this in broaddaylight.</p><p>Other deeds, more audacious still, were suspicious in the eyes of thepeople by reason of their very audacity. On the 4th of April, 1832, apasser-by mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle of the RueSainte-Marguerite and shouted: &ldquo;I am a Babouvist!&rdquo; But beneath Babeuf, thepeople scented Gisquet.</p><p>Among other things, this man said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Down with property! The opposition of the left is cowardly andtreacherous. When it wants to be on the right side, it preachesrevolution, it is democratic in order to escape being beaten, and royalistso that it may not have to fight. The republicans are beasts withfeathers. Distrust the republicans, citizens of the laboring classes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Silence, citizen spy!&rdquo; cried an artisan.</p><p>This shout put an end to the discourse.</p><p>Mysterious incidents occurred.</p><p>At nightfall, a workingman encountered near the canal a &ldquo;very well dressedman,&rdquo; who said to him: &ldquo;Whither are you bound, citizen?&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; repliedthe workingman, &ldquo;I have not the honor of your acquaintance.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know youvery well, however.&rdquo; And the man added: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, I am an agentof the committee. You are suspected of not being quite faithful. You knowthat if you reveal anything, there is an eye fixed on you.&rdquo; Then he shookhands with the workingman and went away, saying: &ldquo;We shall meet againsoon.&rdquo;</p><p>The police, who were on the alert, collected singular dialogues, not onlyin the wine-shops, but in the street.</p><p>&ldquo;Get yourself received very soon,&rdquo; said a weaver to a cabinet-maker.</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is going to be a shot to fire.&rdquo;</p><p>Two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies, fraught withevident Jacquerie:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Who governs us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;M. Philippe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, it is the bourgeoisie.&rdquo;</p><p>The reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word <i>Jacquerie</i> in abad sense. The Jacques were the poor.</p><p>On another occasion two men were heard to say to each other as they passedby: &ldquo;We have a good plan of attack.&rdquo;</p><p>Only the following was caught of a private conversation between four menwho were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the Barrière du Trône:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything possible will be done to prevent his walking about Paris anymore.&rdquo;</p><p>Who was the <i>he?</i> Menacing obscurity.</p><p>&ldquo;The principal leaders,&rdquo; as they said in the faubourg, held themselvesapart. It was supposed that they met for consultation in a wine-shop nearthe point Saint-Eustache. A certain Aug&mdash;, chief of the Society aidfor tailors, Rue Mondétour, had the reputation of serving as intermediarycentral between the leaders and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.</p><p>Nevertheless, there was always a great deal of mystery about theseleaders, and no certain fact can invalidate the singular arrogance of thisreply made later on by a man accused before the Court of Peers:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Who was your leader?&rdquo;</p><p><i>&ldquo;I knew of none and I recognized none.&rdquo;</i></p><p>There was nothing but words, transparent but vague; sometimes idlereports, rumors, hearsay. Other indications cropped up.</p><p>A carpenter, occupied in nailing boards to a fence around the ground onwhich a house was in process of construction, in the Rue de Reuilly foundon that plot the torn fragment of a letter on which were still legible thefollowing lines:&mdash;</p><p>The committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the sections forthe different societies.</p><p>And, as a postscript:&mdash;</p><p>We have learned that there are guns in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière,No. 5 [bis], to the number of five or six thousand, in the house of agunsmith in that court. The section owns no arms.</p><p>What excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to hisneighbors was the fact, that a few paces further on he picked up anotherpaper, torn like the first, and still more significant, of which wereproduce a facsimile, because of the historical interest attaching tothese strange documents:&mdash;</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0032" id="linkimage-0032"></a><img src="images/4b1-5-a-page26.jpg" alt="[Illustration: Q C D E Learn this list by heart.

Thus: Q. <i>Bannerel</i>. 8 guns, 83 cartridges. A safeman.&mdash;C. <i>Boubière</i>. 1 pistol, 40 cartridges.&mdash;D. <i>Rollet</i>. 1 foil,1 pistol, 1 pound of powder.&mdash;E. <i>Tessier</i>. 1 sword, 1 cartridge-box.Exact.&mdash; <i>Terreur</i>. 8 guns. Brave, etc.</p><p>Finally, this carpenter found, still in the same enclosure, a third paperon which was written in pencil, but very legibly, this sort of enigmaticallist:&mdash;</p><p class="letter">Unité: Blanchard: Arbre-Sec. 6.<br/>Barra. Soize. Salle-au-Comte.<br/>Kosciusko. Aubry the Butcher?<br/>J. J. R.<br/>Caius Gracchus.<br/>Right of revision. Dufond. Four.<br/>Fall of the Girondists. Derbac. Maubuée.<br/>Washington. Pinson. 1 pistol, 86 cartridges.<br/>Marseillaise.<br/>Sovereignty of the people. Michel. Quincampoix. Sword.<br/>Hoche.<br/>Marceau. Plato. Arbre-Sec.<br/>Warsaw. Tilly, crier of the <i>Populaire</i>.</p><p>The honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew itssignificance. It appears that this list was the complete nomenclature ofthe sections of the fourth arondissement of the Society of the Rights ofMan, with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections. To-day, whenall these facts which were obscure are nothing more than history, we maypublish them. It should be added, that the foundation of the Society ofthe Rights of Man seems to have been posterior to the date when this paperwas found. Perhaps this was only a rough draft.</p><p>Still, according to all the remarks and the words, according to writtennotes, material facts begin to make their appearance.</p><p>In the Rue Popincourt, in the house of a dealer in bric-à-brac, there wereseized seven sheets of gray paper, all folded alike lengthwise and infour; these sheets enclosed twenty-six squares of this same gray paperfolded in the form of a cartridge, and a card, on which was written thefollowing:&mdash;</p><p class="letter">Saltpetre . . . . . . . . . . .  12 ounces.<br/>Sulphur   . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces.<br/>Charcoal  . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces and a half.<br/>Water     . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces.</p><p>The report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong smell ofpowder.</p><p>A mason returning from his day&rsquo;s work, left behind him a little package ona bench near the bridge of Austerlitz. This package was taken to thepolice station. It was opened, and in it were found two printed dialogues,signed <i>Lahautière</i>, a song entitled: &ldquo;Workmen, band together,&rdquo; and a tinbox full of cartridges.</p><p>One artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see howwarm he was; the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat.</p><p>In a ditch on the boulevard, between Père-Lachaise and the Barrière duTrône, at the most deserted spot, some children, while playing, discoveredbeneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits of wood, a bag containing abullet-mould, a wooden punch for the preparation of cartridges, a woodenbowl, in which there were grains of hunting-powder, and a little cast-ironpot whose interior presented evident traces of melted lead.</p><p>Police agents, making their way suddenly and unexpectedly at five o&rsquo;clockin the morning, into the dwelling of a certain Pardon, who was afterwardsa member of the Barricade-Merry section and got himself killed in theinsurrection of April, 1834, found him standing near his bed, and holdingin his hand some cartridges which he was in the act of preparing.</p><p>Towards the hour when workingmen repose, two men were seen to meet betweenthe Barrière Picpus and the Barrière Charenton in a little lane betweentwo walls, near a wine-shop, in front of which there was a &ldquo;Jeu de Siam.&rdquo;<ahref="#linknote-33" name="linknoteref-33" id="linknoteref-33">33</a> Onedrew a pistol from beneath his blouse and handed it to the other. As hewas handing it to him, he noticed that the perspiration of his chest hadmade the powder damp. He primed the pistol and added more powder to whatwas already in the pan. Then the two men parted.</p><p>A certain Gallais, afterwards killed in the Rue Beaubourg in the affair ofApril, boasted of having in his house seven hundred cartridges andtwenty-four flints.</p><p>The government one day received a warning that arms and two hundredthousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg. On thefollowing week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed. The remarkablepoint about it was, that the police were not able to seize a single one.</p><p>An intercepted letter read: &ldquo;The day is not far distant when, within fourhours by the clock, eighty thousand patriots will be under arms.&rdquo;</p><p>All this fermentation was public, one might almost say tranquil. Theapproaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in the face of thegovernment. No singularity was lacking to this still subterranean crisis,which was already perceptible. The bourgeois talked peaceably to theworking-classes of what was in preparation. They said: &ldquo;How is the risingcoming along?&rdquo; in the same tone in which they would have said: &ldquo;How isyour wife?&rdquo;</p><p>A furniture-dealer, of the Rue Moreau, inquired: &ldquo;Well, when are you goingto make the attack?&rdquo;</p><p>Another shop-keeper said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The attack will be made soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know it. A month ago, there were fifteen thousand of you, now there aretwenty-five thousand.&rdquo; He offered his gun, and a neighbor offered a smallpistol which he was willing to sell for seven francs.</p><p>Moreover, the revolutionary fever was growing. Not a point in Paris nor inFrance was exempt from it. The artery was beating everywhere. Like thosemembranes which arise from certain inflammations and form in the humanbody, the network of secret societies began to spread all over thecountry. From the associations of the Friends of the People, which was atthe same time public and secret, sprang the Society of the Rights of Man,which also dated from one of the orders of the day: <i>Pluviôse, Year 40 ofthe republican era</i>, which was destined to survive even the mandate of theCourt of Assizes which pronounced its dissolution, and which did nothesitate to bestow on its sections significant names like the following:&mdash;</p><p class="letter">Pikes.<br/>Tocsin.<br/>Signal cannon.<br/>Phrygian cap.<br/>January 21.<br/>The beggars.<br/>The vagabonds.<br/>Forward march.<br/>Robespierre.<br/>Level.<br/>Ça Ira.</p><p>The Society of the Rights of Man engendered the Society of Action. Thesewere impatient individuals who broke away and hastened ahead. Otherassociations sought to recruit themselves from the great mother societies.The members of sections complained that they were torn asunder. Thus, theGallic Society, and the committee of organization of the Municipalities.Thus the associations for the liberty of the press, for individualliberty, for the instruction of the people against indirect taxes. Thenthe Society of Equal Workingmen which was divided into three fractions,the levellers, the communists, the reformers. Then the Army of theBastilles, a sort of cohort organized on a military footing, four mencommanded by a corporal, ten by a sergeant, twenty by a sub-lieutenant,forty by a lieutenant; there were never more than five men who knew eachother. Creation where precaution is combined with audacity and whichseemed stamped with the genius of Venice.</p><p>The central committee, which was at the head, had two arms, the Society ofAction, and the Army of the Bastilles.</p><p>A legitimist association, the Chevaliers of Fidelity, stirred about amongthese the republican affiliations. It was denounced and repudiated there.</p><p>The Parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities, Lyons,Nantes, Lille, Marseilles, and each had its Society of the Rights of Man,the Charbonnière, and The Free Men. All had a revolutionary society whichwas called the Cougourde. We have already mentioned this word.</p><p>In Paris, the Faubourg Saint-Marceau kept up an equal buzzing with theFaubourg Saint-Antoine, and the schools were no less moved than thefaubourgs. A café in the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe and the wine-shop of the<i>Seven Billiards</i>, Rue des Mathurins-Saint-Jacques, served as rallyingpoints for the students. The Society of the Friends of the A B Caffiliated to the Mutualists of Angers, and to the Cougourde of Aix, met,as we have seen, in the Café Musain. These same young men assembled also,as we have stated already, in a restaurant wine-shop of the Rue Mondétourwhich was called Corinthe. These meetings were secret. Others were aspublic as possible, and the reader can judge of their boldness from thesefragments of an interrogatory undergone in one of the ulteriorprosecutions: &ldquo;Where was this meeting held?&rdquo; &ldquo;In the Rue de la Paix.&rdquo; &ldquo;Atwhose house?&rdquo; &ldquo;In the street.&rdquo; &ldquo;What sections were there?&rdquo; &ldquo;Only one.&rdquo; &ldquo;Which?&rdquo; &ldquo;The Manuel section.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who was its leader?&rdquo; &ldquo;I.&rdquo; &ldquo;You are tooyoung to have decided alone upon the bold course of attacking thegovernment. Where did your instructions come from?&rdquo; &ldquo;From the centralcommittee.&rdquo;</p><p>The army was mined at the same time as the population, as was provedsubsequently by the operations of Béford, Luneville, and Épinard. Theycounted on the fifty-second regiment, on the fifth, on the eighth, on thethirty-seventh, and on the twentieth light cavalry. In Burgundy and in thesouthern towns they planted the liberty tree; that is to say, a polesurmounted by a red cap.</p><p>Such was the situation.</p><p>The Faubourg Saint-Antoine, more than any other group of the population,as we stated in the beginning, accentuated this situation and made itfelt. That was the sore point. This old faubourg, peopled like anant-hill, laborious, courageous, and angry as a hive of bees, wasquivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult. Everythingwas in a state of agitation there, without any interruption, however, ofthe regular work. It is impossible to convey an idea of this lively yetsombre physiognomy. In this faubourg exists poignant distress hidden underattic roofs; there also exist rare and ardent minds. It is particularly inthe matter of distress and intelligence that it is dangerous to haveextremes meet.</p><p>The Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble; for itreceived the counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures, strikes,slack seasons, all inherent to great political disturbances. In times ofrevolution misery is both cause and effect. The blow which it dealsrebounds upon it. This population full of proud virtue, capable to thehighest degree of latent heat, always ready to fly to arms, prompt toexplode, irritated, deep, undermined, seemed to be only awaiting the fallof a spark. Whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chased by thewind of events, it is impossible not to think of the FaubourgSaint-Antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the verygates of Paris that powder-house of suffering and ideas.</p><p>The wine-shops of the <i>Faubourg Antoine</i>, which have been more than oncedrawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused, possesshistorical notoriety. In troublous times people grow intoxicated theremore on words than on wine. A sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatus ofthe future circulates there, swelling hearts and enlarging souls. Thecabarets of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine resemble those taverns of MontAventine erected on the cave of the Sibyl and communicating with theprofound and sacred breath; taverns where the tables were almost tripods,and where was drunk what Ennius calls the <i>sibylline wine</i>.</p><p>The Faubourg Saint-Antoine is a reservoir of people. Revolutionaryagitations create fissures there, through which trickles the popularsovereignty. This sovereignty may do evil; it can be mistaken like anyother; but, even when led astray, it remains great. We may say of it as ofthe blind cyclops, <i>Ingens</i>.</p><p>In &rsquo;93, according as the idea which was floating about was good or evil,according as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm, there leapedforth from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine now savage legions, now heroicbands.</p><p>Savage. Let us explain this word. When these bristling men, who in theearly days of the revolutionary chaos, tattered, howling, wild, withuplifted bludgeon, pike on high, hurled themselves upon ancient Paris inan uproar, what did they want? They wanted an end to oppression, an end totyranny, an end to the sword, work for men, instruction for the child,social sweetness for the woman, liberty, equality, fraternity, bread forall, the idea for all, the Edenizing of the world. Progress; and thatholy, sweet, and good thing, progress, they claimed in terrible wise,driven to extremities as they were, half naked, club in fist, a roar intheir mouths. They were savages, yes; but the savages of civilization.</p><p>They proclaimed right furiously; they were desirous, if only with fear andtrembling, to force the human race to paradise. They seemed barbarians,and they were saviours. They demanded light with the mask of night.</p><p>Facing these men, who were ferocious, we admit, and terrifying, butferocious and terrifying for good ends, there are other men, smiling,embroidered, gilded, beribboned, starred, in silk stockings, in whiteplumes, in yellow gloves, in varnished shoes, who, with their elbows on avelvet table, beside a marble chimney-piece, insist gently on demeanor andthe preservation of the past, of the Middle Ages, of divine right, offanaticism, of innocence, of slavery, of the death penalty, of war,glorifying in low tones and with politeness, the sword, the stake, and thescaffold. For our part, if we were forced to make a choice between thebarbarians of civilization and the civilized men of barbarism, we shouldchoose the barbarians.</p><p>But, thank Heaven, still another choice is possible. No perpendicular fallis necessary, in front any more than in the rear.</p><p>Neither despotism nor terrorism. We desire progress with a gentle slope.</p><p>God takes care of that. God&rsquo;s whole policy consists in rendering slopesless steep.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0228" id="link2HCH0228"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;ENJOLRAS AND HIS LIEUTENANTS</h3><p>It was about this epoch that Enjolras, in view of a possible catastrophe,instituted a kind of mysterious census.</p><p>All were present at a secret meeting at the Café Musain.</p><p>Enjolras said, mixing his words with a few half-enigmatical butsignificant metaphors:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It is proper that we should know where we stand and on whom we may count.If combatants are required, they must be provided.

Letus, therefore, reckon a little on the herd. How many of us are there?There is no question of postponing this task until to-morrow.Revolutionists should always be hurried; progress has no time to lose. Letus mistrust the unexpected. Let us not be caught unprepared. We must goover all the seams that we have made and see whether they hold fast. Thisbusiness ought to be concluded to-day. Courfeyrac, you will see thepolytechnic students. It is their day to go out. To-day is Wednesday.Feuilly, you will see those of the Glacière, will you not? Combeferre haspromised me to go to Picpus.

They are an enthusiastic family,but liable to cool off. I don&rsquo;t know what has been the matter with themfor some time past. They are thinking of something else. They are becomingextinguished. They pass their time playing dominoes. There is urgent needthat some one should go and talk with them a little, but with firmness.They meet at Richefeu&rsquo;s. They are to be found there between twelve and oneo&rsquo;clock. Those ashes must be fanned into a glow. For that errand I hadcounted on that abstracted Marius, who is a good fellow on the whole, buthe no longer comes to us. I need some one for the Barrière du Maine.

You capable of it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am capable of descending the Rue de Grès, of crossing the PlaceSaint-Michel, of sloping through the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, of taking theRue de Vaugirard, of passing the Carmelites, of turning into the Rued&rsquo;Assas, of reaching the Rue du Cherche-Midi, of leaving behind me theConseil de Guerre, of pacing the Rue des Vieilles-Tuileries, of stridingacross the boulevard, of following the Chaussée du Maine, of passing thebarrier, and entering Richefeu&rsquo;s. I am capable of that. My shoes arecapable of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know anything of those comrades who meet at Richefeu&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not much. We only address each other as <i>thou</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What will you say to them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will speak to them of Robespierre, pardi! Of Danton. Of principles.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I. But I don&rsquo;t receive justice. When I set about it, I am terrible. Ihave read Prudhomme, I know the Social Contract, I know my constitution ofthe year Two by heart. &lsquo;The liberty of one citizen ends where the libertyof another citizen begins.&rsquo; Do you take me for a brute? I have an oldbank-bill of the Republic in my drawer. The Rights of Man, the sovereigntyof the people, sapristi! I am even a bit of a Hébertist. I can talk themost superb twaddle for six hours by the clock, watch in hand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be serious,&rdquo; said Enjolras.</p><p>&ldquo;I am wild,&rdquo; replied Grantaire.</p><p>Enjolras meditated for a few moments, and made the gesture of a man whohas taken a resolution.</p><p>&ldquo;Grantaire,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;I consent to try you. You shall go to theBarrière du Maine.&rdquo;</p><p>Grantaire lived in furnished lodgings very near the Café Musain. He wentout, and five minutes later he returned. He had gone home to put on aRobespierre waistcoat.</p><p>&ldquo;Red,&rdquo; said he as he entered, and he looked intently at Enjolras. Then,with the palm of his energetic hand, he laid the two scarlet points of thewaistcoat across his breast.</p><p>And stepping up to Enjolras, he whispered in his ear:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Be easy.&rdquo;</p><p>He jammed his hat on resolutely and departed.</p><p>A quarter of an hour later, the back room of the Café Musain was deserted.All the friends of the A B C were gone, each in his own direction, each tohis own task. Enjolras, who had reserved the Cougourde of Aix for himself,was the last to leave.</p><p>Those members of the Cougourde of Aix who were in Paris then met on theplain of Issy, in one of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous inthat side of Paris.</p><p>As Enjolras walked towards this place, he passed the whole situation inreview in his own mind. The gravity of events was self-evident. Whenfacts, the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady, move heavily, theslightest complication stops and entangles them. A phenomenon whencearises ruin and new births. Enjolras descried a luminous uplifting beneaththe gloomy skirts of the future. Who knows? Perhaps the moment was athand. The people were again taking possession of right, and what a finespectacle! The revolution was again majestically taking possession ofFrance and saying to the world: &ldquo;The sequel to-morrow!&rdquo; Enjolras wascontent. The furnace was being heated. He had at that moment a powdertrain of friends scattered all over Paris. He composed, in his own mind,with Combeferre&rsquo;s philosophical and penetrating eloquence, Feuilly&rsquo;scosmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac&rsquo;s dash, Bahorel&rsquo;s smile, JeanProuvaire&rsquo;s melancholy, Joly&rsquo;s science, Bossuet&rsquo;s sarcasms, a sort ofelectric spark which took fire nearly everywhere at once. All hands towork. Surely, the result would answer to the effort. This was well. Thismade him think of Grantaire.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;the Barrière du Maine will not take me farout of my way. What if I were to go on as far as Richefeu&rsquo;s? Let us have alook at what Grantaire is about, and see how he is getting on.&rdquo;</p><p>One o&rsquo;clock was striking from the Vaugirard steeple when Enjolras reachedthe Richefeu smoking-room.</p><p>He pushed open the door, entered, folded his arms, letting the door fallto and strike his shoulders, and gazed at that room filled with tables,men, and smoke.</p><p>A voice broke forth from the mist of smoke, interrupted by another voice.It was Grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary.</p><p>Grantaire was sitting opposite another figure, at a marble Saint-Annetable, strewn with grains of bran and dotted with dominos. He washammering the table with his fist, and this is what Enjolras heard:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Double-six.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The pig! I have no more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are dead. A two.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Six.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Three.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my move.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Four points.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not much.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have made an enormous mistake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are doing well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fifteen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Seven more.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That makes me twenty-two.&rdquo; [Thoughtfully, &ldquo;Twenty-two!&rdquo;]</p><p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t expecting that double-six. If I had placed it at thebeginning, the whole play would have been changed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A two again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One! Well, five.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was your play, I believe?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Blank.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What luck he has! Ah!

It was only nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening. Mariusbetook himself to Courfeyrac. Courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbableinhabitant of the Latin Quarter, he had gone to live in the Rue de laVerrerie &ldquo;for political reasons&rdquo;; this quarter was one where, at thatepoch, insurrection liked to install itself. Marius said to Courfeyrac: &ldquo;Ihave come to sleep with you.&rdquo; Courfeyrac dragged a mattress off his bed,which was furnished with two, spread it out on the floor, and said:&ldquo;There.&rdquo;</p><p>At seven o&rsquo;clock on the following morning, Marius returned to the hovel,paid the quarter&rsquo;s rent which he owed to Ma&rsquo;am Bougon, had his books, hisbed, his table, his commode, and his two chairs loaded on a hand-cart andwent off without leaving his address, so that when Javert returned in thecourse of the morning, for the purpose of questioning Marius as to theevents of the preceding evening, he found only Ma&rsquo;am Bougon, who answered:&ldquo;Moved away!&rdquo;</p><p>Ma&rsquo;am Bougon was convinced that Marius was to some extent an accomplice ofthe robbers who had been seized the night before. &ldquo;Who would ever havesaid it?&rdquo; she exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter, &ldquo;a young manlike that, who had the air of a girl!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence. The first was,that he now had a horror of that house, where he had beheld, so close athand, and in its most repulsive and most ferocious development, a socialdeformity which is, perhaps, even more terrible than the wicked rich man,the wicked poor man. The second was, that he did not wish to figure in thelawsuit which would insue in all probability, and be brought in to testifyagainst Thénardier.</p><p>Javert thought that the young man, whose name he had forgotten, wasafraid, and had fled, or perhaps, had not even returned home at the timeof the ambush; he made some efforts to find him, however, but withoutsuccess.</p><p>A month passed, then another. Marius was still with Courfeyrac. He hadlearned from a young licentiate in law, an habitual frequenter of thecourts, that Thénardier was in close confinement. Every Monday, Marius hadfive francs handed in to the clerk&rsquo;s office of La Force for Thénardier.</p><p>As Marius had no longer any money, he borrowed the five francs fromCourfeyrac. It was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowedmoney. These periodical five francs were a double riddle to Courfeyrac wholent and to Thénardier who received them. &ldquo;To whom can they go?&rdquo; thoughtCourfeyrac. &ldquo;Whence can this come to me?&rdquo; Thénardier asked himself.</p><p>Moreover, Marius was heart-broken. Everything had plunged through atrap-door once more. He no longer saw anything before him; his life wasagain buried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly. He had for a momentbeheld very close at hand, in that obscurity, the young girl whom heloved, the old man who seemed to be her father, those unknown beings, whowere his only interest and his only hope in this world; and, at the verymoment when he thought himself on the point of grasping them, a gust hadswept all these shadows away. Not a spark of certainty and truth had beenemitted even in the most terrible of collisions. No conjecture waspossible. He no longer knew even the name that he thought he knew. Itcertainly was not Ursule. And the Lark was a nickname. And what was he tothink of the old man? Was he actually in hiding from the police? Thewhite-haired workman whom Marius had encountered in the vicinity of theInvalides recurred to his mind. It now seemed probable that thatworkingman and M. Leblanc were one and the same person. So he disguisedhimself? That man had his heroic and his equivocal sides. Why had he notcalled for help? Why had he fled? Was he, or was he not, the father of theyoung girl? Was he, in short, the man whom Thénardier thought that herecognized? Thénardier might have been mistaken. These formed so manyinsoluble problems. All this, it is true, detracted nothing from theangelic charms of the young girl of the Luxembourg. Heart-rendingdistress; Marius bore a passion in his heart, and night over his eyes. Hewas thrust onward, he was drawn, and he could not stir. All had vanished,save love. Of love itself he had lost the instincts and the suddenilluminations. Ordinarily, this flame which burns us lights us also alittle, and casts some useful gleams without. But Marius no longer evenheard these mute counsels of passion. He never said to himself: &ldquo;What if Iwere to go to such a place? What if I were to try such and such a thing?&rdquo; The girl whom he could no longer call Ursule was evidently somewhere;nothing warned Marius in what direction he should seek her. His whole lifewas now summed up in two words; absolute uncertainty within animpenetrable fog. To see her once again; he still aspired to this, but heno longer expected it.</p><p>To crown all, his poverty had returned. He felt that icy breath close tohim, on his heels. In the midst of his torments, and long before this, hehad discontinued his work, and nothing is more dangerous than discontinuedwork; it is a habit which vanishes. A habit which is easy to get rid of,and difficult to take up again.</p><p>A certain amount of dreaming is good, like a narcotic in discreet doses.It lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor, which are sometimessevere, and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which correctsthe over-harsh contours of pure thought, fills in gaps here and there,binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas. But too muchdreaming sinks and drowns. Woe to the brain-worker who allows himself tofall entirely from thought into reverie! He thinks that he can re-ascendwith equal ease, and he tells himself that, after all, it is the samething. Error!</p><p>Thought is the toil of the intelligence, reverie its voluptuousness. Toreplace thought with reverie is to confound a poison with a food.</p><p>Marius had begun in that way, as the reader will remember. Passion hadsupervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimæraswithout object or bottom. One no longer emerges from one&rsquo;s self except forthe purpose of going off to dream. Idle production. Tumultuous andstagnant gulf. And, in proportion as labor diminishes, needs increase.This is a law. Man, in a state of reverie, is generally prodigal and slack;the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds.</p><p>There is, in that mode of life, good mingled with evil, for if enervationis baleful, generosity is good and healthful. But the poor man who isgenerous and noble, and who does not work, is lost. Resources areexhausted, needs crop up.</p><p>Fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well as themost feeble and most vicious are drawn, and which ends in one of twoholds, suicide or crime.</p><p>By dint of going outdoors to think, the day comes when one goes out tothrow one&rsquo;s self in the water.</p><p>Excess of reverie breeds men like Escousse and Lebras.</p><p>Marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace, with his eyes fixedon the girl whom he no longer saw. What we have just written seemsstrange, and yet it is true. The memory of an absent being kindles in thedarkness of the heart; the more it has disappeared, the more it beams; thegloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon; the star of theinner night. She&mdash;that was Marius&rsquo; whole thought. He meditated ofnothing else; he was confusedly conscious that his old coat was becomingan impossible coat, and that his new coat was growing old, that his shirtswere wearing out, that his hat was wearing out, that his boots were givingout, and he said to himself: &ldquo;If I could but see her once again before Idie!&rdquo;</p><p>One sweet idea alone was left to him, that she had loved him, that herglance had told him so, that she did not know his name, but that she didknow his soul, and that, wherever she was, however mysterious the place,she still loved him perhaps. Who knows whether she were not thinking ofhim as he was thinking of her? Sometimes, in those inexplicable hours suchas are experienced by every heart that loves, though he had no reasons foranything but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy, he said tohimself: &ldquo;It is her thoughts that are coming to me!&rdquo; Then he added:&ldquo;Perhaps my thoughts reach her also.&rdquo;</p><p>This illusion, at which he shook his head a moment later, was sufficient,nevertheless, to throw beams, which at times resembled hope, into hissoul. From time to time, especially at that evening hour which is the mostdepressing to even the dreamy, he allowed the purest, the most impersonal,the most ideal of the reveries which filled his brain, to fall upon anotebook which contained nothing else. He called this &ldquo;writing to her.&rdquo;</p><p>It must not be supposed that his reason was deranged. Quite the contrary.He had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly towards any fixedgoal, but he was endowed with more clear-sightedness and rectitude thanever. Marius surveyed by a calm and real, although peculiar light, whatpassed before his eyes, even the most indifferent deeds and men; hepronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort of honest dejectionand candid disinterestedness. His judgment, which was almost whollydisassociated from hope, held itself aloof and soared on high.</p><p>In this state of mind nothing escaped him, nothing deceived him, and everymoment he was discovering the foundation of life, of humanity, and ofdestiny. Happy, even in the midst of anguish, is he to whom God has givena soul worthy of love and of unhappiness! He who has not viewed the thingsof this world and the heart of man under this double light has seennothing and knows nothing of the true.</p><p>The soul which loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity.</p><p>However, day followed day, and nothing new presented itself. It merelyseemed to him, that the sombre space which still remained to be traversedby him was growing shorter with every instant. He thought that he alreadydistinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless abyss.</p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he repeated to himself, &ldquo;shall I not see her again before then!&rdquo;</p><p>When you have ascended the Rue Saint-Jacques, left the barrier on one sideand followed the old inner boulevard for some distance, you reach the Ruede la Santé, then the Glacière, and, a little while before arriving at thelittle river of the Gobelins, you come to a sort of field which is theonly spot in the long and monotonous chain of the boulevards of Paris,where Ruysdael would be tempted to sit down.</p><p>There is something indescribable there which exhales grace, a green meadowtraversed by tightly stretched lines, from which flutter rags drying inthe wind, and an old market-gardener&rsquo;s house, built in the time of LouisXIII., with its great roof oddly pierced with dormer windows, dilapidatedpalisades, a little water amid poplar-trees, women, voices, laughter; onthe horizon the Panthéon, the pole of the Deaf-Mutes, the Val-de-Grâce,black, squat, fantastic, amusing, magnificent, and in the background, thesevere square crests of the towers of Notre Dame.</p><p>As the place is worth looking at, no one goes thither. Hardly one cart orwagoner passes in a quarter of an hour.</p><p>It chanced that Marius&rsquo; solitary strolls led him to this plot of ground,near the water. That day, there was a rarity on the boulevard, apasser-by. Marius, vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of theplace, asked this passer-by:&mdash;&ldquo;What is the name of this spot?&rdquo;</p><p>The person replied: &ldquo;It is the Lark&rsquo;s meadow.&rdquo;</p><p>And he added: &ldquo;It was here that Ulbach killed the shepherdess of Ivry.&rdquo;</p><p>But after the word &ldquo;Lark&rdquo; Marius heard nothing more. These suddencongealments in the state of reverie, which a single word suffices toevoke, do occur. The entire thought is abruptly condensed around an idea,and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else.</p><p>The Lark was the appellation which had replaced Ursule in the depths ofMarius&rsquo; melancholy.&mdash;&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said he with a sort of unreasoningstupor peculiar to these mysterious asides, &ldquo;this is her meadow. I shallknow where she lives now.&rdquo;</p><p>It was absurd, but irresistible.</p><p>And every day he returned to that meadow of the Lark.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0230" id="link2HCH0230"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;EMBRYONIC FORMATION OF CRIMES IN THE INCUBATION OFPRISONS</h3><p>Javert&rsquo;s triumph in the Gorbeau hovel seemed complete, but had not beenso.</p><p>In the first place, and this constituted the principal anxiety, Javert hadnot taken the prisoner prisoner. The assassinated man who flees is moresuspicious than the assassin, and it is probable that this personage, whohad been so precious a capture for the ruffians, would be no less fine aprize for the authorities.</p><p>And then, Montparnasse had escaped Javert.</p><p>Another opportunity of laying hands on that &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s dandy&rdquo; must be waitedfor. Montparnasse had, in fact, encountered Éponine as she stood on thewatch under the trees of the boulevard, and had led her off, preferring toplay Nemorin with the daughter rather than Schinderhannes with the father.It was well that he did so. He was free. As for Éponine, Javert had causedher to be seized; a mediocre consolation. Éponine had joined Azelma at LesMadelonettes.</p><p>And finally, on the way from the Gorbeau house to La Force, one of theprincipal prisoners, Claquesous, had been lost. It was not known how thishad been effected, the police agents and the sergeants &ldquo;could notunderstand it at all.&rdquo; He had converted himself into vapor, he had slippedthrough the handcuffs, he had trickled through the crevices of thecarriage, the fiacre was cracked, and he had fled; all that they were ableto say was, that on arriving at the prison, there was no Claquesous.Either the fairies or the police had had a hand in it. Had Claquesousmelted into the shadows like a snow-flake in water? Had there beenunavowed connivance of the police agents? Did this man belong to thedouble enigma of order and disorder? Was he concentric with infraction andrepression? Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws inauthority? Javert did not accept such comminations, and would havebristled up against such compromises; but his squad included otherinspectors besides himself, who were more initiated than he, perhaps,although they were his subordinates in the secrets of the Prefecture, andClaquesous had been such a villain that he might make a very good agent.It is an excellent thing for ruffianism and an admirable thing for thepolice to be on such intimate juggling terms with the night. Thesedouble-edged rascals do exist. However that may be, Claquesous had goneastray and was not found again. Javert appeared to be more irritated thanamazed at this.</p><p>As for Marius, &ldquo;that booby of a lawyer,&rdquo; who had probably becomefrightened, and whose name Javert had forgotten, Javert attached verylittle importance to him. Moreover, a lawyer can be hunted up at any time.But was he a lawyer after all?</p><p>The investigation had begun.</p><p>The magistrate had thought it advisable not to put one of these men of theband of Patron Minette in close confinement, in the hope that he wouldchatter. This man was Brujon, the long-haired man of the Rue duPetit-Banquier. He had been let loose in the Charlemagne courtyard, andthe eyes of the watchers were fixed on him.</p><p>This name of Brujon is one of the souvenirs of La Force. In that hideouscourtyard, called the court of the Bâtiment-Neuf (New Building), which theadministration called the court Saint-Bernard, and which the robberscalled the Fosse-aux-Lions (The Lion&rsquo;s Ditch), on that wall covered withscales and leprosy, which rose on the left to a level with the roofs, nearan old door of rusty iron which led to the ancient chapel of the ducalresidence of La Force, then turned in a dormitory for ruffians, therecould still be seen, twelve years ago, a sort of fortress roughly carvedin the stone with a nail, and beneath it this signature:&mdash;</p><p class="center">BRUJON, 1811.</p><p>The Brujon of 1811 was the father of the Brujon of 1832.</p><p>The latter, of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the Gorbeau house,was a very cunning and very adroit young spark, with a bewildered andplaintive air. It was in consequence of this plaintive air that themagistrate had released him, thinking him more useful in the Charlemagneyard than in close confinement.</p><p>Robbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the hands ofjustice. They do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as that.To be in prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning on anothercrime. They are artists, who have one picture in the salon, and who toil,nonetheless, on a new work in their studios.</p><p>Brujon seemed to be stupefied by prison. He could sometimes be seenstanding by the hour together in front of the sutler&rsquo;s window in theCharlemagne yard, staring like an idiot at the sordid list of prices whichbegan with: <i>garlic</i>, 62 <i>centimes</i>, and ended with: <i>cigar</i>, 5 <i>centimes</i>. Or hepassed his time in trembling, chattering his teeth, saying that he had afever, and inquiring whether one of the eight and twenty beds in the feverward was vacant.</p><p>All at once, towards the end of February, 1832, it was discovered thatBrujon, that somnolent fellow, had had three different commissionsexecuted by the errand-men of the establishment, not under his own name,but in the name of three of his comrades; and they had cost him in allfifty sous, an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention of theprison corporal.</p><p>Inquiries were instituted, and on consulting the tariff of commissionsposted in the convict&rsquo;s parlor, it was learned that the fifty sous couldbe analyzed as follows: three commissions; one to the Panthéon, ten sous;one to Val-de-Grâce, fifteen sous; and one to the Barrière de Grenelle,twenty-five sous. This last was the dearest of the whole tariff. Now, atthe Panthéon, at the Val-de-Grâce, and at the Barrière de Grenelle weresituated the domiciles of the three very redoubtable prowlers of thebarriers, Kruideniers, alias Bizarro, Glorieux, an ex-convict, andBarre-Carosse, upon whom the attention of the police was directed by thisincident. It was thought that these men were members of Patron Minette;two of those leaders, Babet and Gueulemer, had been captured. It wassupposed that the messages, which had been addressed, not to houses, butto people who were waiting for them in the street, must have containedinformation with regard to some crime that had been plotted. They were inpossession of other indications; they laid hand on the three prowlers, andsupposed that they had circumvented some one or other of Brujon&rsquo;smachinations.</p><p>About a week after these measures had been taken, one night, as thesuperintendent of the watch, who had been inspecting the lower dormitoryin the Bâtiment-Neuf, was about to drop his chestnut in the box&mdash;thiswas the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed theirduties punctually; every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all theboxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories&mdash;a watchman lookedthrough the peep-hole of the dormitory and beheld Brujon sitting on hisbed and writing something by the light of the hall-lamp. The guardianentered, Brujon was put in a solitary cell for a month, but they were notable to seize what he had written. The police learned nothing furtherabout it.</p><p>What is certain is, that on the following morning, a &ldquo;postilion&rdquo; was flungfrom the Charlemagne yard into the Lions&rsquo; Ditch, over the five-storybuilding which separated the two court-yards.</p><p>What prisoners call a &ldquo;postilion&rdquo; is a pallet of bread artisticallymoulded, which is sent <i>into Ireland</i>, that is to say, over the roofs of aprison, from one courtyard to another. Etymology: over England; from oneland to another; <i>into Ireland</i>. This little pellet falls in the yard. Theman who picks it up opens it and finds in it a note addressed to someprisoner in that yard. If it is a prisoner who finds the treasure, heforwards the note to its destination; if it is a keeper, or one of theprisoners secretly sold who are called <i>sheep</i> in prisons and <i>foxes</i> in thegalleys, the note is taken to the office and handed over to the police.</p><p>On this occasion, the postilion reached its address, although the personto whom it was addressed was, at that moment, in solitary confinement.This person was no other than Babet, one of the four heads of PatronMinette.</p><p>The postilion contained a roll of paper on which only these two lines werewritten:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Babet. There is an affair in the Rue Plumet. A gate on a garden.&rdquo;</p><p>This is what Brujon had written the night before.</p><p>In spite of male and female searchers, Babet managed to pass the note onfrom La Force to the Salpêtrière, to a &ldquo;good friend&rdquo; whom he had and whowas shut up there. This woman in turn transmitted the note to anotherwoman of her acquaintance, a certain Magnon, who was strongly suspected bythe police, though not yet arrested. This Magnon, whose name the readerhas already seen, had relations with the Thénardier, which will bedescribed in detail later on, and she could, by going to see Éponine,serve as a bridge between the Salpêtrière and Les Madelonettes.</p><p>It happened, that at precisely that moment, as proofs were wanting in theinvestigation directed against Thénardier in the matter of his daughters,Éponine and Azelma were released. When Éponine came out, Magnon, who waswatching the gate of the Madelonettes, handed her Brujon&rsquo;s note to Babet,charging her to look into the matter.</p><p>Éponine went to the Rue Plumet, recognized the gate and the garden,observed the house, spied, lurked, and, a few days later, brought toMagnon, who delivers in the Rue Clocheperce, a biscuit, which Magnontransmitted to Babet&rsquo;s mistress in the Salpêtrière. A biscuit, in theshady symbolism of prisons, signifies: Nothing to be done.</p><p>So that in less than a week from that time, as Brujon and Babet met in thecircle of La Force, the one on his way to the examination, the other onhis way from it:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Brujon, &ldquo;the Rue P.?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Biscuit,&rdquo; replied Babet. Thus did the fœtus of crime engendered byBrujon in La Force miscarry.</p><p>This miscarriage had its consequences, however, which were perfectlydistinct from Brujon&rsquo;s programme. The reader will see what they were.</p><p>Often when we think we are knotting one thread, we are tying quiteanother.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0231" id="link2HCH0231"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;APPARITION TO FATHER MABEUF</h3><p>Marius no longer went to see any one, but he sometimes encountered FatherMabeuf by chance.</p><p>While Marius was slowly descending those melancholy steps which may becalled the cellar stairs, and which lead to places without light, wherethe happy can be heard walking overhead, M.

Mabeuf no longer knew his books, hisgarden, or his indigo: these were the three forms which happiness,pleasure, and hope had assumed for him. This sufficed him for his living.He said to himself: &ldquo;When I shall have made my balls of blueing, I shallbe rich, I will withdraw my copperplates from the pawn-shop, I will put my<i>Flora</i> in vogue again with trickery, plenty of money and advertisements inthe newspapers and I will buy, I know well where, a copy of Pierre deMédine&rsquo;s <i>Art de Naviguer</i>, with wood-cuts, edition of 1655.&rdquo; In themeantime, he toiled all day over his plot of indigo, and at night hereturned home to water his garden, and to read his books. At that epoch,M. Mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age.</p><p>One evening he had a singular apparition.</p><p>He had returned home while it was still broad daylight. Mother Plutarque,whose health was declining, was ill and in bed. He had dined on a bone, onwhich a little meat lingered, and a bit of bread that he had found on thekitchen table, and had seated himself on an overturned stone post, whichtook the place of a bench in his garden.</p><p>Near this bench there rose, after the fashion in orchard-gardens, a sortof large chest, of beams and planks, much dilapidated, a rabbit-hutch onthe ground floor, a fruit-closet on the first. There was nothing in thehutch, but there were a few apples in the fruit-closet,&mdash;the remainsof the winter&rsquo;s provision.</p><p>M. Mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading, with the aid of hisglasses, two books of which he was passionately fond and in which, aserious thing at his age, he was interested. His natural timidity renderedhim accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain degree. Thefirst of these books was the famous treatise of President Delancre, <i>Del&rsquo;Inconstance des Démons</i>; the other was a quarto by Mutor de laRubaudière, <i>Sur les Diables de Vauvert et les Gobelins de la Bièvre</i>. Thislast-mentioned old volume interested him all the more, because his gardenhad been one of the spots haunted by goblins in former times. The twilighthad begun to whiten what was on high and to blacken all below. As he read,over the top of the book which he held in his hand, Father Mabeuf wassurveying his plants, and among others a magnificent rhododendron whichwas one of his consolations; four days of heat, wind, and sun without adrop of rain, had passed; the stalks were bending, the buds drooping, theleaves falling; all this needed water, the rhododendron was particularlysad. Father Mabeuf was one of those persons for whom plants have souls.The old man had toiled all day over his indigo plot, he was worn out withfatigue, but he rose, laid his books on the bench, and walked, all bentover and with tottering footsteps, to the well, but when he had graspedthe chain, he could not even draw it sufficiently to unhook it. Then heturned round and cast a glance of anguish toward heaven which was becomingstudded with stars.</p><p>The evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man beneathan indescribably mournful and eternal joy. The night promised to be asarid as the day had been.</p><p>&ldquo;Stars everywhere!&rdquo; thought the old man; &ldquo;not the tiniest cloud! Not adrop of water!&rdquo;</p><p>And his head, which had been upraised for a moment, fell back upon hisbreast.</p><p>He raised it again, and once more looked at the sky, murmuring:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;A tear of dew! A little pity!&rdquo;</p><p>He tried again to unhook the chain of the well, and could not.</p><p>At that moment, he heard a voice saying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father Mabeuf, would you like to have me water your garden for you?&rdquo;</p><p>At the same time, a noise as of a wild animal passing became audible inthe hedge, and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall,slender girl, who drew herself up in front of him and stared boldly athim. She had less the air of a human being than of a form which had justblossomed forth from the twilight.</p><p>Before Father Mabeuf, who was easily terrified, and who was, as we havesaid, quick to take alarm, was able to reply by a single syllable, thisbeing, whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness, hadunhooked the chain, plunged in and withdrawn the bucket, and filled thewatering-pot, and the goodman beheld this apparition, which had bare feetand a tattered petticoat, running about among the flower-beds distributinglife around her. The sound of the watering-pot on the leaves filled FatherMabeuf&rsquo;s soul with ecstasy. It seemed to him that the rhododendron washappy now.</p><p>The first bucketful emptied, the girl drew a second, then a third. Shewatered the whole garden.</p><p>There was something about her, as she thus ran about among paths, whereher outline appeared perfectly black, waving her angular arms, and withher fichu all in rags, that resembled a bat.</p><p>When she had finished, Father Mabeuf approached her with tears in hiseyes, and laid his hand on her brow.</p><p>&ldquo;God will bless you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are an angel since you take care ofthe flowers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I am the devil, but that&rsquo;s all the same to me.&rdquo;</p><p>The old man exclaimed, without either waiting for or hearing her response:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What a pity that I am so unhappy and so poor, and that I can do nothingfor you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can do something,&rdquo; said she.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me where M. Marius lives.&rdquo;</p><p>The old man did not understand. &ldquo;What Monsieur Marius?&rdquo;</p><p>He raised his glassy eyes and seemed to be seeking something that hadvanished.</p><p>&ldquo;A young man who used to come here.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, M. Mabeuf had searched his memory.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! yes&mdash;&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I know what you mean. Wait! MonsieurMarius&mdash;the Baron Marius Pontmercy, parbleu! He lives,&mdash;orrather, he no longer lives,&mdash;ah well, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>As he spoke, he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron, and hecontinued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold, I know now. He very often passes along the boulevard, and goes inthe direction of the Glacière, Rue Croulebarbe. The meadow of the Lark. Gothere. It is not hard to meet him.&rdquo;</p><p>When M. Mabeuf straightened himself up, there was no longer any one there;the girl had disappeared.</p><p>He was decidedly terrified.</p><p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;if my garden had not been watered, I should thinkthat she was a spirit.&rdquo;</p><p>An hour later, when he was in bed, it came back to him, and as he fellasleep, at that confused moment when thought, like that fabulous birdwhich changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea, little bylittle assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber, he saidto himself in a bewildered way:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;In sooth, that greatly resembles what Rubaudière narrates of the goblins.Could it have been a goblin?&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0232" id="link2HCH0232"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;AN APPARITION TO MARIUS</h3><p>Some days after this visit of a &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; to Farmer Mabeuf, one morning,&mdash;itwas on a Monday, the day when Marius borrowed the hundred-sou piece fromCourfeyrac for Thénardier&mdash;Marius had put this coin in his pocket,and before carrying it to the clerk&rsquo;s office, he had gone &ldquo;to take alittle stroll,&rdquo; in the hope that this would make him work on his return.It was always thus, however. As soon as he rose, he seated himself beforea book and a sheet of paper in order to scribble some translation; histask at that epoch consisted in turning into French a celebrated quarrelbetween Germans, the Gans and Savigny controversy; he took Savigny, hetook Gans, read four lines, tried to write one, could not, saw a starbetween him and his paper, and rose from his chair, saying: &ldquo;I shall goout. That will put me in spirits.&rdquo;</p><p>And off he went to the Lark&rsquo;s meadow.</p><p>There he beheld more than ever the star, and less than ever Savigny andGans.</p><p>He returned home, tried to take up his work again, and did not succeed;there was no means of re-knotting a single one of the threads which werebroken in his brain; then he said to himself: &ldquo;I will not go outto-morrow. It prevents my working.&rdquo; And he went out every day.</p><p>He lived in the Lark&rsquo;s meadow more than in Courfeyrac&rsquo;s lodgings. That washis real address: Boulevard de la Santé, at the seventh tree from the RueCroulebarbe.</p><p>That morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on theparapet of the River des Gobelins. A cheerful sunlight penetrated thefreshly unfolded and luminous leaves.</p><p>He was dreaming of &ldquo;Her.&rdquo; And his meditation turning to a reproach, fellback upon himself; he reflected dolefully on his idleness, his paralysisof soul, which was gaining on him, and of that night which was growingmore dense every moment before him, to such a point that he no longer evensaw the sun.</p><p>Nevertheless, athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas whichwas not even a monologue, so feeble had action become in him, and he hadno longer the force to care to despair, athwart this melancholyabsorption, sensations from without did reach him. He heard behind him,beneath him, on both banks of the river, the laundresses of the Gobelinsbeating their linen, and above his head, the birds chattering and singingin the elm-trees. On the one hand, the sound of liberty, the carelesshappiness of the leisure which has wings; on the other, the sound of toil.What caused him to meditate deeply, and almost reflect, were two cheerfulsounds.</p><p>All at once, in the midst of his dejected ecstasy, he heard a familiarvoice saying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Come! Here he is!&rdquo;</p><p>He raised his eyes, and recognized that wretched child who had come to himone morning, the elder of the Thénardier daughters, Éponine; he knew hername now. Strange to say, she had grown poorer and prettier, two stepswhich it had not seemed within her power to take. She had accomplished adouble progress, towards the light and towards distress. She wasbarefooted and in rags, as on the day when she had so resolutely enteredhis chamber, only her rags were two months older now, the holes werelarger, the tatters more sordid. It was the same harsh voice, the samebrow dimmed and wrinkled with tan, the same free, wild, and vacillatingglance. She had besides, more than formerly, in her face thatindescribably terrified and lamentable something which sojourn in a prisonadds to wretchedness.</p><p>She had bits of straw and hay in her hair, not like Ophelia through havinggone mad from the contagion of Hamlet&rsquo;s madness, but because she had sleptin the loft of some stable.</p><p>And in spite of it all, she was beautiful. What a star art thou, O youth!</p><p>In the meantime, she had halted in front of Marius with a trace of joy inher livid countenance, and something which resembled a smile.</p><p>She stood for several moments as though incapable of speech.</p><p>&ldquo;So I have met you at last!&rdquo; she said at length. &ldquo;Father Mabeuf was right,it was on this boulevard! How I have hunted for you! If you only knew! Doyou know? I have been in the jug. A fortnight! They let me out! seeingthat there was nothing against me, and that, moreover, I had not reachedyears of discretion. I lack two months of it. Oh! how I have hunted foryou! These six weeks! So you don&rsquo;t live down there any more?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! I understand. Because of that affair. Those take-downs aredisagreeable. You cleared out. Come now! Why do you wear old hats likethis! A young man like you ought to have fine clothes. Do you know,Monsieur Marius, Father Mabeuf calls you Baron Marius, I don&rsquo;t know what.It isn&rsquo;t true that you are a baron? Barons are old fellows, they go to theLuxembourg, in front of the château, where there is the most sun, and theyread the <i>Quotidienne</i> for a sou. I once carried a letter to a baron of thatsort. He was over a hundred years old. Say, where do you live now?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius made no reply.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you have a hole in your shirt. I must sew it up foryou.&rdquo;</p><p>She resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem glad to see me.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius held his peace; she remained silent for a moment, then exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;But if I choose, nevertheless, I could force you to look glad!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Marius. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! you used to call me <i>thou</i>,&rdquo; she retorted.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, what dost thou mean?&rdquo;</p><p>She bit her lips; she seemed to hesitate, as though a prey to some sort ofinward conflict. At last she appeared to come to a decision.</p><p>&ldquo;So much the worse, I don&rsquo;t care. You have a melancholy air, I want you tobe pleased. Only promise me that you will smile. I want to see you smileand hear you say: &lsquo;Ah, well, that&rsquo;s good.&rsquo; Poor Mr. Marius! you know? Youpromised me that you would give me anything I like&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes! Only speak!&rdquo;</p><p>She looked Marius full in the eye, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have the address.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius turned pale. All the blood flowed back to his heart.</p><p>&ldquo;What address?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The address that you asked me to get!&rdquo;</p><p>She added, as though with an effort:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The address&mdash;you know very well!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; stammered Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Of that young lady.&rdquo;</p><p>This word uttered, she sighed deeply.</p><p>Marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized herhand distractedly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Well! lead me thither! Tell me! Ask of me anything you wish! Where isit?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the street or number verywell; it is in quite the other direction from here, but I know the housewell, I will take you to it.&rdquo;</p><p>She withdrew her hand and went on, in a tone which could have rent theheart of an observer, but which did not even graze Marius in hisintoxicated and ecstatic state:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! how glad you are!&rdquo;</p><p>A cloud swept across Marius&rsquo; brow. He seized Éponine by the arm:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Swear one thing to me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Swear!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what does that mean? Come! You want me to swear?&rdquo;</p><p>And she laughed.</p><p>&ldquo;Your father! promise me, Éponine! Swear to me that you will not give thisaddress to your father!&rdquo;</p><p>She turned to him with a stupefied air.</p><p>&ldquo;Éponine! How do you know that my name is Éponine?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Promise what I tell you!&rdquo;</p><p>But she did not seem to hear him.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice! You have called me Éponine!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius grasped both her arms at once.</p><p>&ldquo;But answer me, in the name of Heaven! pay attention to what I am sayingto you, swear to me that you will not tell your father this address thatyou know!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My father!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Ah yes, my father! Be at ease. He&rsquo;s in closeconfinement. Besides, what do I care for my father!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you do not promise me!&rdquo; exclaimed Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Let go of me!&rdquo; she said, bursting into a laugh, &ldquo;how you do shake me!Yes! Yes! I promise that! I swear that to you! What is that to me? I willnot tell my father the address. There! Is that right? Is that it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nor to any one?&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Nor to any one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; resumed Marius, &ldquo;take me there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Immediately?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come along. Ah! how pleased he is!&rdquo; said she.</p><p>After a few steps she halted.</p><p>&ldquo;You are following me too closely, Monsieur Marius. Let me go on ahead,and follow me so, without seeming to do it. A nice young man like you mustnot be seen with a woman like me.&rdquo;</p><p>No tongue can express all that lay in that word, <i>woman</i>, thus pronounced bythat child.</p><p>She proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more; Marius joined her.She addressed him sideways, and without turning towards him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;By the way, you know that you promised me something?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius fumbled in his pocket. All that he owned in the world was the fivefrancs intended for Thénardier the father. He took them and laid them inÉponine&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>She opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground, and gazed athim with a gloomy air.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your money,&rdquo; said she.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0266" id="link2H_4_0266"></a>BOOK THIRD&mdash;THE HOUSE IN THE RUE PLUMET</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0233" id="link2HCH0233"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE HOUSE WITH A SECRET</h3><p>About the middle of the last century, a chief justice in the Parliament ofParis having a mistress and concealing the fact, for at that period thegrand seignors displayed their mistresses, and the bourgeois concealedthem, had &ldquo;a little house&rdquo; built in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in thedeserted Rue Blomet, which is now called Rue Plumet, not far from the spotwhich was then designated as <i>Combat des Animaux</i>.</p><p>This house was composed of a single-storied pavilion; two rooms on theground floor, two chambers on the first floor, a kitchen downstairs, aboudoir upstairs, an attic under the roof, the whole preceded by a gardenwith a large gate opening on the street. This garden was about an acre anda half in extent. This was all that could be seen by passers-by; butbehind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard, and at the end of thecourtyard a low building consisting of two rooms and a cellar, a sort ofpreparation destined to conceal a child and nurse in case of need. Thisbuilding communicated in the rear by a masked door which opened by asecret spring, with a long, narrow, paved winding corridor, open to thesky, hemmed in with two lofty walls, which, hidden with wonderful art, andlost as it were between garden enclosures and cultivated land, all ofwhose angles and detours it followed, ended in another door, also with asecret lock which opened a quarter of a league away, almost in anotherquarter, at the solitary extremity of the Rue du Babylone.</p><p>Through this the chief justice entered, so that even those who were spyingon him and following him would merely have observed that the justicebetook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere, and would neverhave suspected that to go to the Rue de Babylone was to go to the RueBlomet. Thanks to clever purchasers of land, the magistrate had been ableto make a secret, sewer-like passage on his own property, andconsequently, without interference. Later on, he had sold in littleparcels, for gardens and market gardens, the lots of ground adjoining thecorridor, and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thought they hada party wall before their eyes, and did not even suspect the long, pavedribbon winding between two walls amid their flower-beds and theirorchards. Only the birds beheld this curiosity. It is probable that thelinnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal about thechief justice.</p><p>The pavilion, built of stone in the taste of Mansard, wainscoted andfurnished in the Watteau style, rocaille on the inside, old-fashioned onthe outside, walled in with a triple hedge of flowers, had somethingdiscreet, coquettish, and solemn about it, as befits a caprice of love andmagistracy.</p><p>This house and corridor, which have now disappeared, were in existencefifteen years ago. In &rsquo;93 a coppersmith had purchased the house with theidea of demolishing it, but had not been able to pay the price; the nationmade him bankrupt. So that it was the house which demolished thecoppersmith. After that, the house remained uninhabited, and fell slowlyto ruin, as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does notcommunicate life. It had remained fitted with its old furniture, wasalways for sale or to let, and the ten or a dozen people who passedthrough the Rue Plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegiblebit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since 1819.</p><p>Towards the end of the Restoration, these same passers-by might havenoticed that the bill had disappeared, and even that the shutters on thefirst floor were open. The house was occupied, in fact. The windows hadshort curtains, a sign that there was a woman about.</p><p>In the month of October, 1829, a man of a certain age had presentedhimself and had hired the house just as it stood, including, of course,the back building and the lane which ended in the Rue de Babylone. He hadhad the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired. Thehouse, as we have just mentioned, was still very nearly furnished with thejustice&rsquo;s old fitting; the new tenant had ordered some repairs, had addedwhat was lacking here and there, had replaced the paving-stones in theyard, bricks in the floors, steps in the stairs, missing bits in theinlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows, and had finallyinstalled himself there with a young girl and an elderly maid-servant,without commotion, rather like a person who is slipping in than like a manwho is entering his own house. The neighbors did not gossip about him, forthe reason that there were no neighbors.</p><p>This unobtrusive tenant was Jean Valjean, the young girl was Cosette. Theservant was a woman named Toussaint, whom Jean Valjean had saved from thehospital and from wretchedness, and who was elderly, a stammerer, and fromthe provinces, three qualities which had decided Jean Valjean to take herwith him. He had hired the house under the name of M. Fauchelevent,independent gentleman. In all that has been related heretofore, the readerhas, doubtless, been no less prompt than Thénardier to recognize JeanValjean.</p><p>Why had Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the Petit-Picpus? What hadhappened?</p><p>Nothing had happened.</p><p>It will be remembered that Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, so happythat his conscience finally took the alarm. He saw Cosette every day, hefelt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more, he broodedover the soul of that child, he said to himself that she was his, thatnothing could take her from him, that this would last indefinitely, thatshe would certainly become a nun, being thereto gently incited every day,that thus the convent was henceforth the universe for her as it was forhim, that he should grow old there, and that she would grow up there, thatshe would grow old there, and that he should die there; that, in short,delightful hope, no separation was possible. On reflecting upon this, hefell into perplexity. He interrogated himself. He asked himself if allthat happiness were really his, if it were not composed of the happinessof another, of the happiness of that child which he, an old man, wasconfiscating and stealing; if that were not theft? He said to himself,that this child had a right to know life before renouncing it, that todeprive her in advance, and in some sort without consulting her, of alljoys, under the pretext of saving her from all trials, to take advantageof her ignorance of her isolation, in order to make an artificial vocationgerminate in her, was to rob a human creature of its nature and to lie toGod. And who knows if, when she came to be aware of all this some day, andfound herself a nun to her sorrow, Cosette would not come to hate him? Alast, almost selfish thought, and less heroic than the rest, but which wasintolerable to him. He resolved to quit the convent.</p><p>He resolved on this; he recognized with anguish, the fact that it wasnecessary. As for objections, there were none. Five years&rsquo; sojourn betweenthese four walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed ordispersed the elements of fear. He could return tranquilly among men. Hehad grown old, and all had undergone a change. Who would recognize himnow? And then, to face the worst, there was danger only for himself, andhe had no right to condemn Cosette to the cloister for the reason that hehad been condemned to the galleys. Besides, what is danger in comparisonwith the right? Finally, nothing prevented his being prudent and takinghis precautions.</p><p>As for Cosette&rsquo;s education, it was almost finished and complete.</p><p>His determination once taken, he awaited an opportunity. It was not longin presenting itself. Old Fauchelevent died.</p><p>Jean Valjean demanded an audience with the revered prioress and told herthat, having come into a little inheritance at the death of his brother,which permitted him henceforth to live without working, he should leavethe service of the convent and take his daughter with him; but that, as itwas not just that Cosette, since she had not taken the vows, should havereceived her education gratuitously, he humbly begged the ReverendPrioress to see fit that he should offer to the community, as indemnity,for the five years which Cosette had spent there, the sum of five thousandfrancs.</p><p>It was thus that Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the PerpetualAdoration.</p><p>On leaving the convent, he took in his own arms the little valise the keyto which he still wore on his person, and would permit no porter to touchit. This puzzled Cosette, because of the odor of embalming which proceededfrom it.</p><p>Let us state at once, that this trunk never quitted him more. He alwayshad it in his chamber. It was the first and only thing sometimes, that hecarried off in his moving when he moved about. Cosette laughed at it, andcalled this valise his <i>inseparable</i>, saying: &ldquo;I am jealous of it.&rdquo;</p><p>Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did not reappear in the open air withoutprofound anxiety.</p><p>He discovered the house in the Rue Plumet, and hid himself from sightthere. Henceforth he was in the possession of the name:&mdash;UltimeFauchelevent.</p><p>At the same time he hired two other apartments in Paris, in order that hemight attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the samequarter, and so that he could, at need, take himself off at the slightestdisquietude which should assail him, and in short, so that he might notagain be caught unprovided as on the night when he had so miraculouslyescaped from Javert. These two apartments were very pitiable, poor inappearance, and in two quarters which were far remote from each other, theone in the Rue de l&rsquo;Ouest, the other in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé.</p><p>He went from time to time, now to the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé, now to the Ruede l&rsquo;Ouest, to pass a month or six weeks, without taking Toussaint. He hadhimself served by the porters, and gave himself out as a gentleman fromthe suburbs, living on his funds, and having a little temporaryresting-place in town. This lofty virtue had three domiciles in Paris forthe sake of escaping from the police.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0234" id="link2HCH0234"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;JEAN VALJEAN AS A NATIONAL GUARD</h3><p>However, properly speaking, he lived in the Rue Plumet, and he hadarranged his existence there in the following fashion:&mdash;</p><p>Cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion; she had the bigsleeping-room with the painted pier-glasses, the boudoir with the gildedfillets, the justice&rsquo;s drawing-room furnished with tapestries and vastarmchairs; she had the garden. Jean Valjean had a canopied bed of antiquedamask in three colors and a beautiful Persian rug purchased in the Rue duFiguier-Saint-Paul at Mother Gaucher&rsquo;s, put into Cosette&rsquo;s chamber, and,in order to redeem the severity of these magnificent old things, he hadamalgamated with this bric-à-brac all the gay and graceful little piecesof furniture suitable to young girls, an étagère, a bookcase filled withgilt-edged books, an inkstand, a blotting-book, paper, a work-tableincrusted with mother of pearl, a silver-gilt dressing-case, a toiletservice in Japanese porcelain. Long damask curtains with a red foundationand three colors, like those on the bed, hung at the windows of the firstfloor. On the ground floor, the curtains were of tapestry. All winterlong, Cosette&rsquo;s little house was heated from top to bottom. Jean Valjeaninhabited the sort of porter&rsquo;s lodge which was situated at the end of theback courtyard, with a mattress on a folding-bed, a white wood table, twostraw chairs, an earthenware water-jug, a few old volumes on a shelf, hisbeloved valise in one corner, and never any fire. He dined with Cosette,and he had a loaf of black bread on the table for his own use.</p><p>When Toussaint came, he had said to her: &ldquo;It is the young lady who is themistress of this house.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And you, monsieur?&rdquo; Toussaint replied inamazement.&mdash;&ldquo;I am a much better thing than the master, I am thefather.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent, and she regulatedtheir expenditure, which was very modest. Every day, Jean Valjean put hisarm through Cosette&rsquo;s and took her for a walk. He led her to theLuxembourg, to the least frequented walk, and every Sunday he took her tomass at Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, because that was a long way off. As itwas a very poor quarter, he bestowed alms largely there, and the poorpeople surrounded him in church, which had drawn down upon himThénardier&rsquo;s epistle: &ldquo;To the benevolent gentleman of the church ofSaint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.&rdquo; He was fond of taking Cosette to visit thepoor and the sick. No stranger ever entered the house in the Rue Plumet.Toussaint brought their provisions, and Jean Valjean went himself forwater to a fountain nearby on the boulevard. Their wood and wine were putinto a half-subterranean hollow lined with rock-work which lay near theRue de Babylone and which had formerly served the chief-justice as agrotto; for at the epoch of follies and &ldquo;Little Houses&rdquo; no love waswithout a grotto.</p><p>In the door opening on the Rue de Babylone, there was a box destined forthe reception of letters and papers; only, as the three inhabitants of thepavilion in the Rue Plumet received neither papers nor letters, the entireusefulness of that box, formerly the go-between of a love affair, and theconfidant of a love-lorn lawyer, was now limited to the tax-collector&rsquo;snotices, and the summons of the guard. For M. Fauchelevent, independentgentleman, belonged to the national guard; he had not been able to escapethrough the fine meshes of the census of 1831. The municipal informationcollected at that time had even reached the convent of the Petit-Picpus, asort of impenetrable and holy cloud, whence Jean Valjean had emerged invenerable guise, and, consequently, worthy of mounting guard in the eyesof the town-hall.</p><p>Three or four times a year, Jean Valjean donned his uniform and mountedguard; he did this willingly, however; it was a correct disguise whichmixed him with every one, and yet left him solitary. Jean Valjean had justattained his sixtieth birthday, the age of legal exemption; but he did notappear to be over fifty; moreover, he had no desire to escape hissergeant-major nor to quibble with Comte de Lobau; he possessed no civilstatus, he was concealing his name, he was concealing his identity, so heconcealed his age, he concealed everything; and, as we have just said, hewillingly did his duty as a national guard; the sum of his ambition lay inresembling any other man who paid his taxes. This man had for his ideal,within, the angel, without, the bourgeois.</p><p>Let us note one detail, however; when Jean Valjean went out with Cosette,he dressed as the reader has already seen, and had the air of a retiredofficer. When he went out alone, which was generally at night, he wasalways dressed in a workingman&rsquo;s trousers and blouse, and wore a cap whichconcealed his face. Was this precaution or humility? Both. Cosette wasaccustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny, and hardly noticed herfather&rsquo;s peculiarities. As for Toussaint, she venerated Jean Valjean, andthought everything he did right.</p><p>One day, her butcher, who had caught a glimpse of Jean Valjean, said toher: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer fish.&rdquo; She replied: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a saint.&rdquo;</p><p>Neither Jean Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussaint ever entered or emergedexcept by the door on the Rue de Babylone. Unless seen through the gardengate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in the RuePlumet. That gate was always closed. Jean Valjean had left the gardenuncultivated, in order not to attract attention.</p><p>In this, possibly, he made a mistake.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0235" id="link2HCH0235"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;FOLIIS AC FRONDIBUS</h3><p>The garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had becomeextraordinary and charming. The passers-by of forty years ago halted togaze at it, without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its freshand verdant depths. More than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed histhoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of thatancient, padlocked gate, twisted, tottering, fastened to two green andmoss-covered pillars, and oddly crowned with a pediment of undecipherablearabesque.</p><p>There was a stone bench in one corner, one or two mouldy statues, severallattices which had lost their nails with time, were rotting on the wall,and there were no walks nor turf; but there was enough grass everywhere.Gardening had taken its departure, and nature had returned. Weedsabounded, which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of land. Thefestival of gilliflowers was something splendid. Nothing in this gardenobstructed the sacred effort of things towards life; venerable growthreigned there among them. The trees had bent over towards the nettles, theplant had sprung upward, the branch had inclined, that which crawls on theearth had gone in search of that which expands in the air, that whichfloats on the wind had bent over towards that which trails in the moss;trunks, boughs, leaves, fibres, clusters, tendrils, shoots, spines,thorns, had mingled, crossed, married, confounded themselves in eachother; vegetation in a deep and close embrace, had celebrated andaccomplished there, under the well-pleased eye of the Creator, in thatenclosure three hundred feet square, the holy mystery of fraternity,symbol of the human fraternity. This garden was no longer a garden, it wasa colossal thicket, that is to say, something as impenetrable as a forest,as peopled as a city, quivering like a nest, sombre like a cathedral,fragrant like a bouquet, solitary as a tomb, living as a throng.</p><p>In Floréal<a href="#linknote-34" name="linknoteref-34" id="linknoteref-34">34</a>this enormous thicket, free behind its gate and within its four walls,entered upon the secret labor of germination, quivered in the rising sun,almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love, andwhich feels the sap of April rising and boiling in its veins, and shakesto the wind its enormous wonderful green locks, sprinkled on the dampearth, on the defaced statues, on the crumbling steps of the pavilion, andeven on the pavement of the deserted street, flowers like stars, dew likepearls, fecundity, beauty, life, joy, perfumes. At midday, a thousandwhite butterflies took refuge there, and it was a divine spectacle to seethat living summer snow whirling about there in flakes amid the shade.There, in those gay shadows of verdure, a throng of innocent voices spokesweetly to the soul, and what the twittering forgot to say the hummingcompleted. In the evening, a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden andenveloped it; a shroud of mist, a calm and celestial sadness covered it;the intoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles and convolvulus poured outfrom every part of it, like an exquisite and subtle poison; the lastappeals of the woodpeckers and the wagtails were audible as they dozedamong the branches; one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds and thetrees; by day the wings rejoice the leaves, by night the leaves protectthe wings.</p><p>In winter the thicket was black, dripping, bristling, shivering, andallowed some glimpse of the house. Instead of flowers on the branches anddew in the flowers, the long silvery tracks of the snails were visible onthe cold, thick carpet of yellow leaves; but in any fashion, under anyaspect, at all seasons, spring, winter, summer, autumn, this tinyenclosure breathed forth melancholy, contemplation, solitude, liberty, theabsence of man, the presence of God; and the rusty old gate had the air ofsaying: &ldquo;This garden belongs to me.&rdquo;</p><p>It was of no avail that the pavements of Paris were there on every side,the classic and splendid hotels of the Rue de Varennes a couple of pacesaway, the dome of the Invalides close at hand, the Chamber of Deputies notfar off; the carriages of the Rue de Bourgogne and of the RueSaint-Dominique rumbled luxuriously, in vain, in the vicinity, in vain didthe yellow, brown, white, and red omnibuses cross each other&rsquo;s course atthe neighboring crossroads; the Rue Plumet was the desert; and the deathof the former proprietors, the revolution which had passed over it, thecrumbling away of ancient fortunes, absence, forgetfulness, forty years ofabandonment and widowhood, had sufficed to restore to this privileged spotferns, mulleins, hemlock, yarrow, tall weeds, great crimped plants, withlarge leaves of pale green cloth, lizards, beetles, uneasy and rapidinsects; to cause to spring forth from the depths of the earth and toreappear between those four walls a certain indescribable and savagegrandeur; and for nature, which disconcerts the petty arrangements of man,and which sheds herself always thoroughly where she diffuses herself atall, in the ant as well as in the eagle, to blossom out in a petty littleParisian garden with as much rude force and majesty as in a virgin forestof the New World.</p><p>Nothing is small, in fact; any one who is subject to the profound andpenetrating influence of nature knows this. Although no absolutesatisfaction is given to philosophy, either to circumscribe the cause orto limit the effect, the contemplator falls into those unfathomableecstasies caused by these decompositions of force terminating in unity.Everything toils at everything.</p><p>Algebra is applied to the clouds; the radiation of the star profits therose; no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the hawthornis useless to the constellations. Who, then, can calculate the course of amolecule? How do we know that the creation of worlds is not determined bythe fall of grains of sand? Who knows the reciprocal ebb and flow of theinfinitely great and the infinitely little, the reverberations of causesin the precipices of being, and the avalanches of creation? The tiniestworm is of importance; the great is little, the little is great;everything is balanced in necessity; alarming vision for the mind. Thereare marvellous relations between beings and things; in that inexhaustiblewhole, from the sun to the grub, nothing despises the other; all have needof each other. The light does not bear away terrestrial perfumes into theazure depths, without knowing what it is doing; the night distributesstellar essences to the sleeping flowers. All birds that fly have roundtheir leg the thread of the infinite. Germination is complicated with thebursting forth of a meteor and with the peck of a swallow cracking itsegg, and it places on one level the birth of an earthworm and the adventof Socrates. Where the telescope ends, the microscope begins. Which of thetwo possesses the larger field of vision? Choose. A bit of mould is apleiad of flowers; a nebula is an ant-hill of stars. The samepromiscuousness, and yet more unprecedented, exists between the things ofthe intelligence and the facts of substance. Elements and principlesmingle, combine, wed, multiply with each other, to such a point that thematerial and the moral world are brought eventually to the same clearness.The phenomenon is perpetually returning upon itself. In the vast cosmicexchanges the universal life goes and comes in unknown quantities, rollingentirely in the invisible mystery of effluvia, employing everything, notlosing a single dream, not a single slumber, sowing an animalcule here,crumbling to bits a planet there, oscillating and winding, making of lighta force and of thought an element, disseminated and invisible, dissolvingall, except that geometrical point, the <i>I</i>; bringing everything back to thesoul-atom; expanding everything in God, entangling all activity, fromsummit to base, in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism, attaching theflight of an insect to the movement of the earth, subordinating, whoknows? Were it only by the identity of the law, the evolution of the cometin the firmament to the whirling of the infusoria in the drop of water. Amachine made of mind. Enormous gearing, the prime motor of which is thegnat, and whose final wheel is the zodiac.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0236" id="link2HCH0236"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;CHANGE OF GATE</h3><p>It seemed that this garden, created in olden days to conceal wantonmysteries, had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chastemysteries. There were no longer either arbors, or bowling greens, ortunnels, or grottos; there was a magnificent, dishevelled obscurityfalling like a veil over all. Paphos had been made over into Eden. It isimpossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this retreatwholesome. This flower-girl now offered her blossom to the soul. Thiscoquettish garden, formerly decidedly compromised, had returned tovirginity and modesty. A justice assisted by a gardener, a goodman whothought that he was a continuation of Lamoignon, and another goodman whothought that he was a continuation of Lenôtre, had turned it about, cut,ruffled, decked, moulded it to gallantry; nature had taken possession ofit once more, had filled it with shade, and had arranged it for love.</p><p>There was, also, in this solitude, a heart which was quite ready. Love hadonly to show himself; he had here a temple composed of verdure, grass,moss, the sight of birds, tender shadows, agitated branches, and a soulmade of sweetness, of faith, of candor, of hope, of aspiration, and ofillusion.</p><p>Cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child; she was alittle more than fourteen, and she was at the &ldquo;ungrateful age&rdquo;; we havealready said, that with the exception of her eyes, she was homely ratherthan pretty; she had no ungraceful feature, but she was awkward, thin,timid and bold at once, a grown-up little girl, in short.</p><p>Her education was finished, that is to say, she has been taught religion,and even and above all, devotion; then &ldquo;history,&rdquo; that is to say the thingthat bears that name in convents, geography, grammar, the participles, thekings of France, a little music, a little drawing, etc.; but in all otherrespects she was utterly ignorant, which is a great charm and a greatperil. The soul of a young girl should not be left in the dark; later on,mirages that are too abrupt and too lively are formed there, as in a darkchamber. She should be gently and discreetly enlightened, rather with thereflection of realities than with their harsh and direct light. A usefuland graciously austere half-light which dissipates puerile fears andobviates falls. There is nothing but the maternal instinct, that admirableintuition composed of the memories of the virgin and the experience of thewoman, which knows how this half-light is to be created and of what itshould consist.</p><p>Nothing supplies the place of this instinct. All the nuns in the world arenot worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl&rsquo;s soul.</p><p>Cosette had had no mother. She had only had many mothers, in the plural.</p><p>As for Jean Valjean, he was, indeed, all tenderness, all solicitude; buthe was only an old man and he knew nothing at all.</p><p>Now, in this work of education, in this grave matter of preparing a womanfor life, what science is required to combat that vast ignorance which iscalled innocence!</p><p>Nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent. The conventturns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown. The heart, thus thrownback upon itself, works downward within itself, since it cannot overflow,and grows deep, since it cannot expand. Hence visions, suppositions,conjectures, outlines of romances, a desire for adventures, fantasticconstructions, edifices built wholly in the inner obscurity of the mind,sombre and secret abodes where the passions immediately find a lodgementas soon as the open gate permits them to enter. The convent is acompression which, in order to triumph over the human heart, should lastduring the whole life.</p><p>On quitting the convent, Cosette could have found nothing more sweet andmore dangerous than the house in the Rue Plumet. It was the continuationof solitude with the beginning of liberty; a garden that was closed, but anature that was acrid, rich, voluptuous, and fragrant; the same dreams asin the convent, but with glimpses of young men; a grating, but one thatopened on the street.</p><p>Still, when she arrived there, we repeat, she was only a child. JeanValjean gave this neglected garden over to her. &ldquo;Do what you like withit,&rdquo; he said to her. This amused Cosette; she turned over all the clumpsand all the stones, she hunted for &ldquo;beasts&rdquo;; she played in it, whileawaiting the time when she would dream in it; she loved this garden forthe insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass, while awaitingthe day when she would love it for the stars that she would see throughthe boughs above her head.</p><p>And then, she loved her father, that is to say, Jean Valjean, with all hersoul, with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman a beloved andcharming companion to her. It will be remembered that M. Madeleine hadbeen in the habit of reading a great deal. Jean Valjean had continued thispractice; he had come to converse well; he possessed the secret riches andthe eloquence of a true and humble mind which has spontaneously cultivateditself. He retained just enough sharpness to season his kindness; his mindwas rough and his heart was soft. During their conversations in theLuxembourg, he gave her explanations of everything, drawing on what he hadread, and also on what he had suffered. As she listened to him, Cosette&rsquo;seyes wandered vaguely about.</p><p>This simple man sufficed for Cosette&rsquo;s thought, the same as the wildgarden sufficed for her eyes. When she had had a good chase after thebutterflies, she came panting up to him and said: &ldquo;Ah! How I have run!&rdquo; Hekissed her brow.</p><p>Cosette adored the goodman. She was always at his heels. Where JeanValjean was, there happiness was. Jean Valjean lived neither in thepavilion nor the garden; she took greater pleasure in the paved backcourtyard, than in the enclosure filled with flowers, and in his littlelodge furnished with straw-seated chairs than in the great drawing-roomhung with tapestry, against which stood tufted easy-chairs. Jean Valjeansometimes said to her, smiling at his happiness in being importuned: &ldquo;Dogo to your own quarters! Leave me alone a little!&rdquo;</p><p>She gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so gracefulwhen they come from a daughter to her father.</p><p>&ldquo;Father, I am very cold in your rooms; why don&rsquo;t you have a carpet hereand a stove?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dear child, there are so many people who are better than I and who havenot even a roof over their heads.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why is there a fire in my rooms, and everything that is needed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because you are a woman and a child.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bah! must men be cold and feel uncomfortable?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certain men.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is good, I shall come here so often that you will be obliged to havea fire.&rdquo;</p><p>And again she said to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father, why do you eat horrible bread like that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because, my daughter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, if you eat it, I will eat it too.&rdquo;</p><p>Then, in order to prevent Cosette eating black bread, Jean Valjean atewhite bread.</p><p>Cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood. She prayedmorning and evening for her mother whom she had never known. TheThénardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream. Sheremembered that she had gone &ldquo;one day, at night,&rdquo; to fetch water in aforest. She thought that it had been very far from Paris. It seemed to herthat she had begun to live in an abyss, and that it was Jean Valjean whohad rescued her from it. Her childhood produced upon her the effect of atime when there had been nothing around her but millepeds, spiders, andserpents. When she meditated in the evening, before falling asleep, as shehad not a very clear idea that she was Jean Valjean&rsquo;s daughter, and thathe was her father, she fancied that the soul of her mother had passed intothat good man and had come to dwell near her.</p><p>When he was seated, she leaned her cheek against his white hair, anddropped a silent tear, saying to herself: &ldquo;Perhaps this man is my mother.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette, although this is a strange statement to make, in the profoundignorance of a girl brought up in a convent,&mdash;maternity being alsoabsolutely unintelligible to virginity,&mdash;had ended by fancying thatshe had had as little mother as possible. She did not even know hermother&rsquo;s name. Whenever she asked Jean Valjean, Jean Valjean remainedsilent. If she repeated her question, he responded with a smile. Once sheinsisted; the smile ended in a tear.</p><p>This silence on the part of Jean Valjean covered Fantine with darkness.</p><p>Was it prudence? Was it respect? Was it a fear that he should deliver thisname to the hazards of another memory than his own?</p><p>So long as Cosette had been small, Jean Valjean had been willing to talkto her of her mother; when she became a young girl, it was impossible forhim to do so. It seemed to him that he no longer dared. Was it because ofCosette? Was it because of Fantine? He felt a certain religious horror atletting that shadow enter Cosette&rsquo;s thought; and of placing a third intheir destiny. The more sacred this shade was to him, the more did it seemthat it was to be feared. He thought of Fantine, and felt himselfoverwhelmed with silence.</p><p>Through the darkness, he vaguely perceived something which appeared tohave its finger on its lips. Had all the modesty which had been inFantine, and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime, returnedto rest upon her after her death, to watch in indignation over the peaceof that dead woman, and in its shyness, to keep her in her grave? Was JeanValjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure? We who believe in death,are not among the number who will reject this mysterious explanation.</p><p>Hence the impossibility of uttering, even for Cosette, that name ofFantine.</p><p>One day Cosette said to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father, I saw my mother in a dream last night. She had two big wings. Mymother must have been almost a saint during her life.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Through martyrdom,&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean.</p><p>However, Jean Valjean was happy.</p><p>When Cosette went out with him, she leaned on his arm, proud and happy, inthe plenitude of her heart. Jean Valjean felt his heart melt within himwith delight, at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive, so whollysatisfied with himself alone. The poor man trembled, inundated withangelic joy; he declared to himself ecstatically that this would last alltheir lives; he told himself that he really had not suffered sufficientlyto merit so radiant a bliss, and he thanked God, in the depths of hissoul, for having permitted him to be loved thus, he, a wretch, by thatinnocent being.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0237" id="link2HCH0237"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;THE ROSE PERCEIVES THAT IT IS AN ENGINE OF WAR</h3><p>One day, Cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror, and she said toherself: &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; It seemed to her almost that she was pretty. This threwher in a singularly troubled state of mind. Up to that moment she hadnever thought of her face. She saw herself in her mirror, but she did notlook at herself. And then, she had so often been told that she was homely;Jean Valjean alone said gently: &ldquo;No indeed! no indeed!&rdquo; At all events,Cosette had always thought herself homely, and had grown up in that beliefwith the easy resignation of childhood. And here, all at once, was hermirror saying to her, as Jean Valjean had said: &ldquo;No indeed!&rdquo; That night,she did not sleep. &ldquo;What if I were pretty!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;How odd it wouldbe if I were pretty!&rdquo; And she recalled those of her companions whosebeauty had produced a sensation in the convent, and she said to herself:&ldquo;What! Am I to be like Mademoiselle So-and-So?&rdquo;</p><p>The next morning she looked at herself again, not by accident this time,and she was assailed with doubts: &ldquo;Where did I get such an idea?&rdquo; saidshe; &ldquo;no, I am ugly.&rdquo; She had not slept well, that was all, her eyes weresunken and she was pale. She had not felt very joyous on the precedingevening in the belief that she was beautiful, but it made her very sad notto be able to believe in it any longer. She did not look at herself again,and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hair with her backturned to the mirror.</p><p>In the evening, after dinner, she generally embroidered in wool or didsome convent needlework in the drawing-room, and Jean Valjean read besideher. Once she raised her eyes from her work, and was rendered quite uneasyby the manner in which her father was gazing at her.</p><p>On another occasion, she was passing along the street, and it seemed toher that some one behind her, whom she did not see, said: &ldquo;A pretty woman!but badly dressed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;he does not mean me. I am welldressed and ugly.&rdquo; She was then wearing a plush hat and her merino gown.</p><p>At last, one day when she was in the garden, she heard poor old Toussaintsaying: &ldquo;Do you notice how pretty Cosette is growing, sir?&rdquo; Cosette didnot hear her father&rsquo;s reply, but Toussaint&rsquo;s words caused a sort ofcommotion within her. She fled from the garden, ran up to her room, flewto the looking-glass,&mdash;it was three months since she had looked atherself,&mdash;and gave vent to a cry. She had just dazzled herself.</p><p>She was beautiful and lovely; she could not help agreeing with Toussaintand her mirror. Her figure was formed, her skin had grown white, her hairwas lustrous, an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue eyes.The consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant, like thesudden advent of daylight; other people noticed it also, Toussaint hadsaid so, it was evidently she of whom the passer-by had spoken, therecould no longer be any doubt of that; she descended to the garden again,thinking herself a queen, imagining that she heard the birds singing,though it was winter, seeing the sky gilded, the sun among the trees,flowers in the thickets, distracted, wild, in inexpressible delight.</p><p>Jean Valjean, on his side, experienced a deep and undefinable oppressionat heart.</p><p>In fact, he had, for some time past, been contemplating with terror thatbeauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on Cosette&rsquo;s sweetface. The dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him.</p><p>Cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she becameaware of it herself. But, from the very first day, that unexpected lightwhich was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl&rsquo;sperson, wounded Jean Valjean&rsquo;s sombre eye. He felt that it was a change ina happy life, a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fear ofdisarranging something. This man, who had passed through all manner ofdistresses, who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate, who hadbeen almost wicked and who had become almost a saint, who, after havingdragged the chain of the galleys, was now dragging the invisible but heavychain of indefinite misery, this man whom the law had not released fromits grasp and who could be seized at any moment and brought back from theobscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of public opprobrium, thisman accepted all, excused all, pardoned all, and merely asked ofProvidence, of man, of the law, of society, of nature, of the world, onething, that Cosette might love him!</p><p>That Cosette might continue to love him! That God would not prevent theheart of the child from coming to him, and from remaining with him!Beloved by Cosette, he felt that he was healed, rested, appeased, loadedwith benefits, recompensed, crowned. Beloved by Cosette, it was well withhim! He asked nothing more! Had any one said to him: &ldquo;Do you want anythingbetter?&rdquo; he would have answered: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; God might have said to him: &ldquo;Do youdesire heaven?&rdquo; and he would have replied: &ldquo;I should lose by it.&rdquo;</p><p>Everything which could affect this situation, if only on the surface, madehim shudder like the beginning of something new. He had never known verydistinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means; but he understoodinstinctively, that it was something terrible.</p><p>He gazed with terror on this beauty, which was blossoming out ever moretriumphant and superb beside him, beneath his very eyes, on the innocentand formidable brow of that child, from the depths of her homeliness, ofhis old age, of his misery, of his reprobation.</p><p>He said to himself: &ldquo;How beautiful she is! What is to become of me?&rdquo;</p><p>There, moreover, lay the difference between his tenderness and thetenderness of a mother. What he beheld with anguish, a mother would havegazed upon with joy.</p><p>The first symptoms were not long in making their appearance.</p><p>On the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself: &ldquo;DecidedlyI am beautiful!&rdquo; Cosette began to pay attention to her toilet. Sherecalled the remark of that passer-by: &ldquo;Pretty, but badly dressed,&rdquo; thebreath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had vanished, afterdepositing in her heart one of the two germs which are destined, later on,to fill the whole life of woman, coquetry. Love is the other.</p><p>With faith in her beauty, the whole feminine soul expanded within her. Sheconceived a horror for her merinos, and shame for her plush hat. Herfather had never refused her anything. She at once acquired the wholescience of the bonnet, the gown, the mantle, the boot, the cuff, the stuffwhich is in fashion, the color which is becoming, that science which makesof the Parisian woman something so charming, so deep, and so dangerous.The words <i>heady woman</i> were invented for the Parisienne.</p><p>In less than a month, little Cosette, in that Thebaid of the Rue deBabylone, was not only one of the prettiest, but one of the &ldquo;best dressed&rdquo; women in Paris, which means a great deal more.</p><p>She would have liked to encounter her &ldquo;passer-by,&rdquo; to see what he wouldsay, and to &ldquo;teach him a lesson!&rdquo; The truth is, that she was ravishing inevery respect, and that she distinguished the difference between a bonnetfrom Gérard and one from Herbaut in the most marvellous way.</p><p>Jean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety. He who felt that he couldnever do anything but crawl, walk at the most, beheld wings sprouting onCosette.</p><p>Moreover, from the mere inspection of Cosette&rsquo;s toilet, a woman would haverecognized the fact that she had no mother. Certain little proprieties,certain special conventionalities, were not observed by Cosette. A mother,for instance, would have told her that a young girl does not dress indamask.</p><p>The first day that Cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle,and her white crape bonnet, she took Jean Valjean&rsquo;s arm, gay, radiant,rosy, proud, dazzling. &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how do you like me in thisguise?&rdquo; Jean Valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voiceof an envious man: &ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; He was the same as usual during their walk.On their return home, he asked Cosette:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you put on that other gown and bonnet again,&mdash;you know theones I mean?&rdquo;</p><p>This took place in Cosette&rsquo;s chamber. Cosette turned towards the wardrobewhere her cast-off schoolgirl&rsquo;s clothes were hanging.</p><p>&ldquo;That disguise!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Father, what do you want me to do with it? Ohno, the idea! I shall never put on those horrors again. With that machineon my head, I have the air of Madame Mad-dog.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean heaved a deep sigh.</p><p>From that moment forth, he noticed that Cosette, who had always heretoforeasked to remain at home, saying: &ldquo;Father, I enjoy myself more here withyou,&rdquo; now was always asking to go out. In fact, what is the use of havinga handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display them?</p><p>He also noticed that Cosette had no longer the same taste for the backgarden. Now she preferred the garden, and did not dislike to promenadeback and forth in front of the railed fence. Jean Valjean, who was shy,never set foot in the garden. He kept to his back yard, like a dog.</p><p>Cosette, in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful, lost the graceof ignoring it. An exquisite grace, for beauty enhanced by ingenuousnessis ineffable, and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocentcreature who walks along, holding in her hand the key to paradise withoutbeing conscious of it. But what she had lost in ingenuous grace, shegained in pensive and serious charm. Her whole person, permeated with thejoy of youth, of innocence, and of beauty, breathed forth a splendidmelancholy.</p><p>It was at this epoch that Marius, after the lapse of six months, saw heronce more at the Luxembourg.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0238" id="link2HCH0238"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE BATTLE BEGUN</h3><p>Cosette in her shadow, like Marius in his, was all ready to take fire.Destiny, with its mysterious and fatal patience, slowly drew togetherthese two beings, all charged and all languishing with the stormyelectricity of passion, these two souls which were laden with love as twoclouds are laden with lightning, and which were bound to overflow andmingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire.</p><p>The glance has been so much abused in love romances that it has finallyfallen into disrepute. One hardly dares to say, nowadays, that two beingsfell in love because they looked at each other. That is the way people dofall in love, nevertheless, and the only way. The rest is nothing, but therest comes afterwards. Nothing is more real than these great shocks whichtwo souls convey to each other by the exchange of that spark.</p><p>At that particular hour when Cosette unconsciously darted that glancewhich troubled Marius, Marius had no suspicion that he had also launched alook which disturbed Cosette.</p><p>He caused her the same good and the same evil.</p><p>She had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time, and she hadscrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see, while looking elsewhere.Marius still considered Cosette ugly, when she had already begun to thinkMarius handsome. But as he paid no attention to her, the young man wasnothing to her.</p><p>Still, she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had beautifulhair, beautiful eyes, handsome teeth, a charming tone of voice when sheheard him conversing with his comrades, that he held himself badly when hewalked, if you like, but with a grace that was all his own, that he didnot appear to be at all stupid, that his whole person was noble, gentle,simple, proud, and that, in short, though he seemed to be poor, yet hisair was fine.</p><p>On the day when their eyes met at last, and said to each other thosefirst, obscure, and ineffable things which the glance lisps, Cosette didnot immediately understand. She returned thoughtfully to the house in theRue de l&rsquo;Ouest, where Jean Valjean, according to his custom, had come tospend six weeks. The next morning, on waking, she thought of that strangeyoung man, so long indifferent and icy, who now seemed to pay attention toher, and it did not appear to her that this attention was the least in theworld agreeable to her. She was, on the contrary, somewhat incensed atthis handsome and disdainful individual. A substratum of war stirredwithin her. It struck her, and the idea caused her a wholly childish joy,that she was going to take her revenge at last.</p><p>Knowing that she was beautiful, she was thoroughly conscious, though in anindistinct fashion, that she possessed a weapon. Women play with theirbeauty as children do with a knife. They wound themselves.</p><p>The reader will recall Marius&rsquo; hesitations, his palpitations, his terrors.He remained on his bench and did not approach. This vexed Cosette. Oneday, she said to Jean Valjean: &ldquo;Father, let us stroll about a little inthat direction.&rdquo; Seeing that Marius did not come to her, she went to him.In such cases, all women resemble Mahomet. And then, strange to say, thefirst symptom of true love in a young man is timidity; in a young girl itis boldness. This is surprising, and yet nothing is more simple. It is thetwo sexes tending to approach each other and assuming, each the other&rsquo;squalities.</p><p>That day, Cosette&rsquo;s glance drove Marius beside himself, and Marius&rsquo; glanceset Cosette to trembling. Marius went away confident, and Cosette uneasy.From that day forth, they adored each other.</p><p>The first thing that Cosette felt was a confused and profound melancholy.It seemed to her that her soul had become black since the day before. Sheno longer recognized it. The whiteness of soul in young girls, which iscomposed of coldness and gayety, resembles snow. It melts in love, whichis its sun.</p><p>Cosette did not know what love was. She had never heard the word utteredin its terrestrial sense. On the books of profane music which entered theconvent, <i>amour</i> (love) was replaced by <i>tambour</i> (drum) or <i>pandour</i>. Thiscreated enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the <i>big girls</i>, suchas: <i>Ah, how delightful is the drum! </i> or, <i>Pity is not a pandour</i>. But Cosettehad left the convent too early to have occupied herself much with the&ldquo;drum.&rdquo; Therefore, she did not know what name to give to what she nowfelt. Is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of one&rsquo;smalady?</p><p>She loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly. She didnot know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, useful or dangerous,eternal or temporary, allowable or prohibited; she loved. She would havebeen greatly astonished, had any one said to her: &ldquo;You do not sleep? Butthat is forbidden! You do not eat? Why, that is very bad! You haveoppressions and palpitations of the heart? That must not be! You blush andturn pale, when a certain being clad in black appears at the end of acertain green walk? But that is abominable!&rdquo; She would not haveunderstood, and she would have replied: &ldquo;What fault is there of mine in amatter in which I have no power and of which I know nothing?&rdquo;</p><p>It turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited tothe state of her soul. It was a sort of admiration at a distance, a mutecontemplation, the deification of a stranger. It was the apparition ofyouth to youth, the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining adream, the longed-for phantom realized and made flesh at last, but havingas yet, neither name, nor fault, nor spot, nor exigence, nor defect; in aword, the distant lover who lingered in the ideal, a chimæra with a form.Any nearer and more palpable meeting would have alarmed Cosette at thisfirst stage, when she was still half immersed in the exaggerated mists ofthe cloister. She had all the fears of children and all the fears of nunscombined. The spirit of the convent, with which she had been permeated forthe space of five years, was still in the process of slow evaporation fromher person, and made everything tremble around her. In this situation hewas not a lover, he was not even an admirer, he was a vision. She setherself to adoring Marius as something charming, luminous, and impossible.</p><p>As extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry, she smiled at him withall frankness.</p><p>Every day, she looked forward to the hour for their walk with impatience,she found Marius there, she felt herself unspeakably happy, and thought inall sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she said toJean Valjean:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What a delicious garden that Luxembourg is!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius and Cosette were in the dark as to one another. They did notaddress each other, they did not salute each other, they did not know eachother; they saw each other; and like stars of heaven which are separatedby millions of leagues, they lived by gazing at each other.</p><p>It was thus that Cosette gradually became a woman and developed, beautifuland loving, with a consciousness of her beauty, and in ignorance of herlove. She was a coquette to boot through her ignorance.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0239" id="link2HCH0239"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;TO ONE SADNESS OPPOSE A SADNESS AND A HALF</h3><p>All situations have their instincts. Old and eternal Mother Nature warnedJean Valjean in a dim way of the presence of Marius. Jean Valjeanshuddered to the very bottom of his soul. Jean Valjean saw nothing, knewnothing, and yet he scanned with obstinate attention, the darkness inwhich he walked, as though he felt on one side of him something in processof construction, and on the other, something which was crumbling away.Marius, also warned, and, in accordance with the deep law of God, by thatsame Mother Nature, did all he could to keep out of sight of &ldquo;the father.&rdquo; Nevertheless, it came to pass that Jean Valjean sometimes espied him.Marius&rsquo; manners were no longer in the least natural. He exhibitedambiguous prudence and awkward daring. He no longer came quite close tothem as formerly. He seated himself at a distance and pretended to bereading; why did he pretend that? Formerly he had come in his old coat,now he wore his new one every day; Jean Valjean was not sure that he didnot have his hair curled, his eyes were very queer, he wore gloves; inshort, Jean Valjean cordially detested this young man.</p><p>Cosette allowed nothing to be divined. Without knowing just what was thematter with her she was convinced that there was something in it, and thatit must be concealed.</p><p>There was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which hadrecently come to Cosette, and the habit of new clothes developed by thatstranger which was very repugnant to Jean Valjean. It might be accidental,no doubt, certainly, but it was a menacing accident.</p><p>He never opened his mouth to Cosette about this stranger. One day,however, he could not refrain from so doing, and, with that vague despairwhich suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair, he said toher: &ldquo;What a very pedantic air that young man has!&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette, but a year before only an indifferent little girl, would havereplied: &ldquo;Why, no, he is charming.&rdquo; Ten years later, with the love ofMarius in her heart, she would have answered: &ldquo;A pedant, and insufferableto the sight! You are right!&rdquo;&mdash;At the moment in life and the heartwhich she had then attained, she contented herself with replying, withsupreme calmness: &ldquo;That young man!&rdquo;</p><p>As though she now beheld him for the first time in her life.</p><p>&ldquo;How stupid I am!&rdquo; thought Jean Valjean. &ldquo;She had not noticed him. It is Iwho have pointed him out to her.&rdquo;</p><p>Oh, simplicity of the old! oh, the depth of children!</p><p>It is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble, ofthose vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles,that the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trapwhatever, and that the young man falls into every one. Jean Valjean hadinstituted an undeclared war against Marius, which Marius, with thesublime stupidity of his passion and his age, did not divine. Jean Valjeanlaid a host of ambushes for him; he changed his hour, he changed hisbench, he forgot his handkerchief, he came alone to the Luxembourg; Mariusdashed headlong into all these snares; and to all the interrogation marksplanted by Jean Valjean in his pathway, he ingenuously answered &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; ButCosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern and in herimperturbable tranquillity, so that Jean Valjean arrived at the followingconclusion: &ldquo;That ninny is madly in love with Cosette, but Cosette doesnot even know that he exists.&rdquo;</p><p>Nonetheless did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor. The minute whenCosette would love might strike at any moment. Does not everything beginwith indifference?</p><p>Only once did Cosette make a mistake and alarm him. He rose from his seatto depart, after a stay of three hours, and she said: &ldquo;What, already?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean had not discontinued his trips to the Luxembourg, as he didnot wish to do anything out of the way, and as, above all things, hefeared to arouse Cosette; but during the hours which were so sweet to thelovers, while Cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated Marius, whoperceived nothing else now, and who now saw nothing in all the world butan adored and radiant face, Jean Valjean was fixing on Marius flashing andterrible eyes. He, who had finally come to believe himself incapable of amalevolent feeling, experienced moments when Marius was present, in whichhe thought he was becoming savage and ferocious once more, and he felt theold depths of his soul, which had formerly contained so much wrath,opening once more and rising up against that young man. It almost seemedto him that unknown craters were forming in his bosom.</p><p>What! he was there, that creature! What was he there for? He came creepingabout, smelling out, examining, trying! He came, saying: &ldquo;Hey! Why not?&rdquo; He came to prowl about his, Jean Valjean&rsquo;s, life! to prowl about hishappiness, with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it away!</p><p>Jean Valjean added: &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it! What is he in search of? Anadventure! What does he want? A love affair! A love affair! And I? What! Ihave been first, the most wretched of men, and then the most unhappy, andI have traversed sixty years of life on my knees, I have sufferedeverything that man can suffer, I have grown old without having beenyoung, I have lived without a family, without relatives, without friends,without life, without children, I have left my blood on every stone, onevery bramble, on every mile-post, along every wall, I have been gentle,though others have been hard to me, and kind, although others have beenmalicious, I have become an honest man once more, in spite of everything,I have repented of the evil that I have done and have forgiven the evilthat has been done to me, and at the moment when I receive my recompense,at the moment when it is all over, at the moment when I am just touchingthe goal, at the moment when I have what I desire, it is well, it is good,I have paid, I have earned it, all this is to take flight, all this willvanish, and I shall lose Cosette, and I shall lose my life, my joy, mysoul, because it has pleased a great booby to come and lounge at theLuxembourg.&rdquo;</p><p>Then his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gleam.</p><p>It was no longer a man gazing at a man; it was no longer an enemysurveying an enemy. It was a dog scanning a thief.</p><p>The reader knows the rest. Marius pursued his senseless course. One day hefollowed Cosette to the Rue de l&rsquo;Ouest. Another day he spoke to theporter. The porter, on his side, spoke, and said to Jean Valjean:&ldquo;Monsieur, who is that curious young man who is asking for you?&rdquo; On themorrow Jean Valjean bestowed on Marius that glance which Marius at lastperceived. A week later, Jean Valjean had taken his departure. He swore tohimself that he would never again set foot either in the Luxembourg or inthe Rue de l&rsquo;Ouest. He returned to the Rue Plumet.</p><p>Cosette did not complain, she said nothing, she asked no questions, shedid not seek to learn his reasons; she had already reached the point whereshe was afraid of being divined, and of betraying herself. Jean Valjeanhad no experience of these miseries, the only miseries which are charmingand the only ones with which he was not acquainted; the consequence wasthat he did not understand the grave significance of Cosette&rsquo;s silence.</p><p>He merely noticed that she had grown sad, and he grew gloomy. On his sideand on hers, inexperience had joined issue.</p><p>Once he made a trial. He asked Cosette:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?&rdquo;</p><p>A ray illuminated Cosette&rsquo;s pale face.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she.</p><p>They went thither. Three months had elapsed. Marius no longer went there.Marius was not there.</p><p>On the following day, Jean Valjean asked Cosette again:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?&rdquo;</p><p>She replied, sadly and gently:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean was hurt by this sadness, and heart-broken at thisgentleness.</p><p>What was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already soimpenetrable? What was on its way there within? What was taking place inCosette&rsquo;s soul? Sometimes, instead of going to bed, Jean Valjean remainedseated on his pallet, with his head in his hands, and he passed wholenights asking himself: &ldquo;What has Cosette in her mind?&rdquo; and in thinking ofthe things that she might be thinking about.</p><p>Oh! at such moments, what mournful glances did he cast towards thatcloister, that chaste peak, that abode of angels, that inaccessibleglacier of virtue! How he contemplated, with despairing ecstasy, thatconvent garden, full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins, where allperfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven! How he adored that Edenforever closed against him, whence he had voluntarily and madly emerged!How he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having brought Cosetteback into the world, poor hero of sacrifice, seized and hurled to theearth by his very self-devotion! How he said to himself, &ldquo;What have Idone?&rdquo;</p><p>However, nothing of all this was perceptible to Cosette. No ill-temper, noharshness. His face was always serene and kind. Jean Valjean&rsquo;s mannerswere more tender and more paternal than ever. If anything could havebetrayed his lack of joy, it was his increased suavity.</p><p>On her side, Cosette languished. She suffered from the absence of Mariusas she had rejoiced in his presence, peculiarly, without exactly beingconscious of it. When Jean Valjean ceased to take her on their customarystrolls, a feminine instinct murmured confusedly, at the bottom of herheart, that she must not seem to set store on the Luxembourg garden, andthat if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her, her fatherwould take her thither once more. But days, weeks, months, elapsed. JeanValjean had tacitly accepted Cosette&rsquo;s tacit consent. She regretted it. Itwas too late. So Marius had disappeared; all was over. The day on whichshe returned to the Luxembourg, Marius was no longer there. What was to bedone? Should she ever find him again? She felt an anguish at her heart,which nothing relieved, and which augmented every day; she no longer knewwhether it was winter or summer, whether it was raining or shining,whether the birds were singing, whether it was the season for dahlias ordaisies, whether the Luxembourg was more charming than the Tuileries,whether the linen which the laundress brought home was starched too muchor not enough, whether Toussaint had done &ldquo;her marketing&rdquo; well or ill; andshe remained dejected, absorbed, attentive to but a single thought, hereyes vague and staring as when one gazes by night at a black andfathomless spot where an apparition has vanished.</p><p>However, she did not allow Jean Valjean to perceive anything of this,except her pallor.</p><p>She still wore her sweet face for him.</p><p>This pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble Jean Valjean. Sometimeshe asked her:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo;</p><p>She replied: &ldquo;There is nothing the matter with me.&rdquo;</p><p>And after a silence, when she divined that he was sad also, she would add:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And you, father&mdash;is there anything wrong with you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With me? Nothing,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>These two beings who had loved each other so exclusively, and with sotouching an affection, and who had lived so long for each other nowsuffered side by side, each on the other&rsquo;s account; without acknowledgingit to each other, without anger towards each other, and with a smile.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0240" id="link2HCH0240"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE CHAIN-GANG</h3><p>Jean Valjean was the more unhappy of the two. Youth, even in its sorrows,always possesses its own peculiar radiance.</p><p>At times, Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile. It isthe property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear. Hehad an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was escaping from him. Hewould have liked to resist, to retain her, to arouse her enthusiasm bysome external and brilliant matter. These ideas, puerile, as we have justsaid, and at the same time senile, conveyed to him, by their verychildishness, a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on theimaginations of young girls. He once chanced to see a general onhorseback, in full uniform, pass along the street, Comte Coutard, thecommandant of Paris. He envied that gilded man; what happiness it wouldbe, he said to himself, if he could put on that suit which was anincontestable thing; and if Cosette could behold him thus, she would bedazzled, and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of theTuileries, the guard would present arms to him, and that would suffice forCosette, and would dispel her idea of looking at young men.</p><p>An unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections.</p><p>In the isolated life which they led, and since they had come to dwell inthe Rue Plumet, they had contracted one habit. They sometimes took apleasure trip to see the sun rise, a mild species of enjoyment whichbefits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it.</p><p>For those who love solitude, a walk in the early morning is equivalent toa stroll by night, with the cheerfulness of nature added. The streets aredeserted and the birds are singing. Cosette, a bird herself, liked to riseearly. These matutinal excursions were planned on the preceding evening.He proposed, and she agreed. It was arranged like a plot, they set outbefore daybreak, and these trips were so many small delights for Cosette.These innocent eccentricities please young people.</p><p>Jean Valjean&rsquo;s inclination led him, as we have seen, to the leastfrequented spots, to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. There thenexisted, in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris, a sort of poor meadows,which were almost confounded with the city, where grew in summer sicklygrain, and which, in autumn, after the harvest had been gathered,presented the appearance, not of having been reaped, but peeled. JeanValjean loved to haunt these fields. Cosette was not bored there. It meantsolitude to him and liberty to her. There, she became a little girl oncemore, she could run and almost play; she took off her hat, laid it on JeanValjean&rsquo;s knees, and gathered bunches of flowers. She gazed at thebutterflies on the flowers, but did not catch them; gentleness andtenderness are born with love, and the young girl who cherishes within herbreast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly.She wove garlands of poppies, which she placed on her head, and which,crossed and penetrated with sunlight, glowing until they flamed, formedfor her rosy face a crown of burning embers.</p><p>Even after their life had grown sad, they kept up their custom of earlystrolls.</p><p>One morning in October, therefore, tempted by the serene perfection of theautumn of 1831, they set out, and found themselves at break of day nearthe Barrière du Maine. It was not dawn, it was daybreak; a delightful andstern moment. A few constellations here and there in the deep, pale azure,the earth all black, the heavens all white, a quiver amid the blades ofgrass, everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight. A lark, which seemedmingled with the stars, was carolling at a prodigious height, and onewould have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed immensity. In theEast, the Val-de-Grâce projected its dark mass on the clear horizon withthe sharpness of steel; Venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising behind thatdome and had the air of a soul making its escape from a gloomy edifice.</p><p>All was peace and silence; there was no one on the road; a few straylaborers, of whom they caught barely a glimpse, were on their way to theirwork along the side-paths.</p><p>Jean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited at thegate of a timber-yard. His face was turned towards the highway, his backtowards the light; he had forgotten the sun which was on the point ofrising; he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which themind becomes concentrated, which imprison even the eye, and which areequivalent to four walls. There are meditations which may be calledvertical; when one is at the bottom of them, time is required to return toearth. Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these reveries. He wasthinking of Cosette, of the happiness that was possible if nothing camebetween him and her, of the light with which she filled his life, a lightwhich was but the emanation of her soul. He was almost happy in hisreverie. Cosette, who was standing beside him, was gazing at the clouds asthey turned rosy.</p><p>All at once Cosette exclaimed: &ldquo;Father, I should think some one was comingyonder.&rdquo; Jean Valjean raised his eyes.</p><p>Cosette was right. The causeway which leads to the ancient Barrière duMaine is a prolongation, as the reader knows, of the Rue de Sèvres, and iscut at right angles by the inner boulevard. At the elbow of the causewayand the boulevard, at the spot where it branches, they heard a noise whichit was difficult to account for at that hour, and a sort of confused pilemade its appearance. Some shapeless thing which was coming from theboulevard was turning into the road.</p><p>It grew larger, it seemed to move in an orderly manner, though it wasbristling and quivering; it seemed to be a vehicle, but its load could notbe distinctly made out. There were horses, wheels, shouts; whips werecracking. By degrees the outlines became fixed, although bathed inshadows. It was a vehicle, in fact, which had just turned from theboulevard into the highway, and which was directing its course towards thebarrier near which sat Jean Valjean; a second, of the same aspect,followed, then a third, then a fourth; seven chariots made theirappearance in succession, the heads of the horses touching the rear of thewagon in front. Figures were moving on these vehicles, flashes werevisible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there, aclanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains, and asthis something advanced, the sound of voices waxed louder, and it turnedinto a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams.</p><p>As it drew nearer, it assumed a form, and was outlined behind the treeswith the pallid hue of an apparition; the mass grew white; the day, whichwas slowly dawning, cast a wan light on this swarming heap which was atonce both sepulchral and living, the heads of the figures turned into thefaces of corpses, and this is what it proved to be:&mdash;</p><p>Seven wagons were driving in a file along the road. The first six weresingularly constructed. They resembled coopers&rsquo; drays; they consisted oflong ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rearextremities. Each dray, or rather let us say, each ladder, was attached tofour horses harnessed tandem. On these ladders strange clusters of menwere being drawn. In the faint light, these men were to be divined ratherthan seen. Twenty-four on each vehicle, twelve on a side, back to back,facing the passers-by, their legs dangling in the air,&mdash;this was themanner in which these men were travelling, and behind their backs they hadsomething which clanked, and which was a chain, and on their neckssomething which shone, and which was an iron collar. Each man had hiscollar, but the chain was for all; so that if these four and twenty menhad occasion to alight from the dray and walk, they were seized with asort of inexorable unity, and were obliged to wind over the ground withthe chain for a backbone, somewhat after the fashion of millepeds. In theback and front of each vehicle, two men armed with muskets stood erect,each holding one end of the chain under his foot. The iron necklets weresquare. The seventh vehicle, a huge rack-sided baggage wagon, without ahood, had four wheels and six horses, and carried a sonorous pile of ironboilers, cast-iron pots, braziers, and chains, among which were mingledseveral men who were pinioned and stretched at full length, and who seemedto be ill. This wagon, all lattice-work, was garnished with dilapidatedhurdles which appeared to have served for former punishments. Thesevehicles kept to the middle of the road. On each side marched a doublehedge of guards of infamous aspect, wearing three-cornered hats, like thesoldiers under the Directory, shabby, covered with spots and holes,muffled in uniforms of veterans and the trousers of undertakers&rsquo; men, halfgray, half blue, which were almost hanging in rags, with red epaulets,yellow shoulder belts, short sabres, muskets, and cudgels; they were aspecies of soldier-blackguards. These myrmidons seemed composed of theabjectness of the beggar and the authority of the executioner. The one whoappeared to be their chief held a postilion&rsquo;s whip in his hand. All thesedetails, blurred by the dimness of dawn, became more and more clearlyoutlined as the light increased. At the head and in the rear of the convoyrode mounted gendarmes, serious and with sword in fist.</p><p>This procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached thebarrier, the last was barely debauching from the boulevard. A throng,sprung, it is impossible to say whence, and formed in a twinkling, as isfrequently the case in Paris, pressed forward from both sides of the roadand looked on. In the neighboring lanes the shouts of people calling toeach other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners hastening up to gazewere audible.</p><p>The men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along insilence. They were livid with the chill of morning. They all wore linentrousers, and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes. The rest oftheir costume was a fantasy of wretchedness. Their accoutrements werehorribly incongruous; nothing is more funereal than the harlequin in rags.Battered felt hats, tarpaulin caps, hideous woollen nightcaps, and, sideby side with a short blouse, a black coat broken at the elbow; many worewomen&rsquo;s headgear, others had baskets on their heads; hairy breasts werevisible, and through the rent in their garments tattooed designs could bedescried; temples of Love, flaming hearts, Cupids; eruptions and unhealthyred blotches could also be seen. Two or three had a straw rope attached tothe cross-bar of the dray, and suspended under them like a stirrup, whichsupported their feet. One of them held in his hand and raised to his mouthsomething which had the appearance of a black stone and which he seemed tobe gnawing; it was bread which he was eating. There were no eyes therewhich were not either dry, dulled, or flaming with an evil light. Theescort troop cursed, the men in chains did not utter a syllable; from timeto time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended onshoulder-blades or skulls; some of these men were yawning; their rags wereterrible; their feet hung down, their shoulders oscillated, their headsclashed together, their fetters clanked, their eyes glared ferociously,their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses; inthe rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter.</p><p>This file of vehicles, whatever its nature was, was mournful. It wasevident that to-morrow, that an hour hence, a pouring rain might descend,that it might be followed by another and another, and that theirdilapidated garments would be drenched, that once soaked, these men wouldnot get dry again, that once chilled, they would not again get warm, thattheir linen trousers would be glued to their bones by the downpour, thatthe water would fill their shoes, that no lashes from the whips would beable to prevent their jaws from chattering, that the chain would continueto bind them by the neck, that their legs would continue to dangle, and itwas impossible not to shudder at the sight of these human beings thusbound and passive beneath the cold clouds of autumn, and delivered over tothe rain, to the blast, to all the furies of the air, like trees andstones.</p><p>Blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick men,who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh wagon, andwho appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled with misery.</p><p>Suddenly, the sun made its appearance; the immense light of the Orientburst forth, and one would have said that it had set fire to all thoseferocious heads. Their tongues were unloosed; a conflagration of grins,oaths, and songs exploded. The broad horizontal sheet of light severed thefile in two parts, illuminating heads and bodies, leaving feet and wheelsin the obscurity. Thoughts made their appearance on these faces; it was aterrible moment; visible demons with their masks removed, fierce soulslaid bare. Though lighted up, this wild throng remained in gloom. Some,who were gay, had in their mouths quills through which they blew verminover the crowd, picking out the women; the dawn accentuated theselamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows; there was not oneof these creatures who was not deformed by reason of wretchedness; and thewhole was so monstrous that one would have said that the sun&rsquo;s brilliancyhad been changed into the glare of the lightning. The wagon-load whichheaded the line had struck up a song, and were shouting at the top oftheir voices with a haggard joviality, a pot-pourri by Desaugiers, thenfamous, called <i>The Vestal</i>; the trees shivered mournfully; in thecross-lanes, countenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight tothese coarse strains droned by spectres.</p><p>All sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos; here were to befound the facial angles of every sort of beast, old men, youths, baldheads, gray beards, cynical monstrosities, sour resignation, savage grins,senseless attitudes, snouts surmounted by caps, heads like those of younggirls with corkscrew curls on the temples, infantile visages, and byreason of that, horrible thin skeleton faces, to which death alone waslacking. On the first cart was a negro, who had been a slave, in allprobability, and who could make a comparison of his chains. The frightfulleveller from below, shame, had passed over these brows; at that degree ofabasement, the last transformations were suffered by all in theirextremest depths, and ignorance, converted into dulness, was the equal ofintelligence converted into despair. There was no choice possible betweenthese men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the mud. It was evidentthat the person who had had the ordering of that unclean procession hadnot classified them. These beings had been fettered and coupled pell-mell,in alphabetical disorder, probably, and loaded hap-hazard on those carts.Nevertheless, horrors, when grouped together, always end by evolving aresult; all additions of wretched men give a sum total, each chain exhaleda common soul, and each dray-load had its own physiognomy. By the side ofthe one where they were singing, there was one where they were howling; athird where they were begging; one could be seen in which they weregnashing their teeth; another load menaced the spectators, anotherblasphemed God; the last was as silent as the tomb. Dante would havethought that he beheld his seven circles of hell on the march. The marchof the damned to their tortures, performed in sinister wise, not on theformidable and flaming chariot of the Apocalypse, but, what was moremournful than that, on the gibbet cart.</p><p>One of the guards, who had a hook on the end of his cudgel, made apretence from time to time, of stirring up this mass of human filth. Anold woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five years old,and said to him: &ldquo;Rascal, let that be a warning to you!&rdquo;</p><p>As the songs and blasphemies increased, the man who appeared to be thecaptain of the escort cracked his whip, and at that signal a fearful dulland blind flogging, which produced the sound of hail, fell upon the sevendray-loads; many roared and foamed at the mouth; which redoubled thedelight of the street urchins who had hastened up, a swarm of flies onthese wounds.</p><p>Jean Valjean&rsquo;s eyes had assumed a frightful expression. They were nolonger eyes; they were those deep and glassy objects which replace theglance in the case of certain wretched men, which seem unconscious ofreality, and in which flames the reflection of terrors and ofcatastrophes. He was not looking at a spectacle, he was seeing a vision.He tried to rise, to flee, to make his escape; he could not move his feet.Sometimes, the things that you see seize upon you and hold you fast. Heremained nailed to the spot, petrified, stupid, asking himself, athwartconfused and inexpressible anguish, what this sepulchral persecutionsignified, and whence had come that pandemonium which was pursuing him.All at once, he raised his hand to his brow, a gesture habitual to thosewhose memory suddenly returns; he remembered that this was, in fact, theusual itinerary, that it was customary to make this detour in order toavoid all possibility of encountering royalty on the road toFontainebleau, and that, five and thirty years before, he had himselfpassed through that barrier.</p><p>Cosette was no less terrified, but in a different way. She did notunderstand; what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible; at lengthshe cried:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father! What are those men in those carts?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean replied: &ldquo;Convicts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whither are they going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To the galleys.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, the cudgelling, multiplied by a hundred hands, becamezealous, blows with the flat of the sword were mingled with it, it was aperfect storm of whips and clubs; the convicts bent before it, a hideousobedience was evoked by the torture, and all held their peace, dartingglances like chained wolves.</p><p>Cosette trembled in every limb; she resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father, are they still men?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; answered the unhappy man.</p><p>It was the chain-gang, in fact, which had set out before daybreak fromBicêtre, and had taken the road to Mans in order to avoid Fontainebleau,where the King then was. This caused the horrible journey to last three orfour days longer; but torture may surely be prolonged with the object ofsparing the royal personage a sight of it.</p><p>Jean Valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed. Such encounters areshocks, and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thoroughshaking up.</p><p>Nevertheless, Jean Valjean did not observe that, on his way back to theRue de Babylone with Cosette, the latter was plying him with otherquestions on the subject of what they had just seen; perhaps he was toomuch absorbed in his own dejection to notice her words and reply to them.But when Cosette was leaving him in the evening, to betake herself to bed,he heard her say in a low voice, and as though talking to herself: &ldquo;Itseems to me, that if I were to find one of those men in my pathway, oh, myGod, I should die merely from the sight of him close at hand.&rdquo;</p><p>Fortunately, chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day, therewas some official solemnity apropos of I know not what,&mdash;fêtes inParis, a review in the Champ de Mars, jousts on the Seine, theatricalperformances in the Champs-Élysées, fireworks at the Arc de l&rsquo;Étoile,illuminations everywhere. Jean Valjean did violence to his habits, andtook Cosette to see these rejoicings, for the purpose of diverting herfrom the memory of the day before, and of effacing, beneath the smilingtumult of all Paris, the abominable thing which had passed before her. Thereview with which the festival was spiced made the presence of uniformsperfectly natural; Jean Valjean donned his uniform of a national guardwith the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking himself to shelter.However, this trip seemed to attain its object. Cosette, who made it herlaw to please her father, and to whom, moreover, all spectacles were anovelty, accepted this diversion with the light and easy good grace ofyouth, and did not pout too disdainfully at that flutter of enjoymentcalled a public fête; so that Jean Valjean was able to believe that he hadsucceeded, and that no trace of that hideous vision remained.</p><p>Some days later, one morning, when the sun was shining brightly, and theywere both on the steps leading to the garden, another infraction of therules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself, and to thecustom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused Cosette toadopt, Cosette, in a wrapper, was standing erect in that negligent attireof early morning which envelops young girls in an adorable way and whichproduces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star; and, with her headbathed in light, rosy after a good sleep, submitting to the gentle glancesof the tender old man, she was picking a daisy to pieces. Cosette did notknow the delightful legend, <i>I love a little, passionately, etc</i>.&mdash;whowas there who could have taught her? She was handling the flowerinstinctively, innocently, without a suspicion that to pluck a daisy apartis to do the same by a heart. If there were a fourth, and smiling Gracecalled Melancholy, she would have worn the air of that Grace. Jean Valjeanwas fascinated by the contemplation of those tiny fingers on that flower,and forgetful of everything in the radiance emitted by that child. Ared-breast was warbling in the thicket, on one side. White cloudletsfloated across the sky, so gayly, that one would have said that they hadjust been set at liberty. Cosette went on attentively tearing the leavesfrom her flower; she seemed to be thinking about something; but whateverit was, it must be something charming; all at once she turned her headover her shoulder with the delicate languor of a swan, and said to JeanValjean: &ldquo;Father, what are the galleys like?&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0275" id="link2H_4_0275"></a>BOOK FOURTH&mdash;SUCCOR FROM BELOW MAY TURN OUT TO BE SUCCOR FROM ONHIGH</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0241" id="link2HCH0241"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;A WOUND WITHOUT, HEALING WITHIN</h3><p>Thus their life clouded over by degrees.</p><p>But one diversion, which had formerly been a happiness, remained to them,which was to carry bread to those who were hungry, and clothing to thosewho were cold. Cosette often accompanied Jean Valjean on these visits tothe poor, on which they recovered some remnants of their former freeintercourse; and sometimes, when the day had been a good one, and they hadassisted many in distress, and cheered and warmed many little children,Cosette was rather merry in the evening. It was at this epoch that theypaid their visit to the Jondrette den.</p><p>On the day following that visit, Jean Valjean made his appearance in thepavilion in the morning, calm as was his wont, but with a large wound onhis left arm which was much inflamed, and very angry, which resembled aburn, and which he explained in some way or other. This wound resulted inhis being detained in the house for a month with fever. He would not callin a doctor. When Cosette urged him, &ldquo;Call the dog-doctor,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air andsuch angelic happiness at being of use to him, that Jean Valjean felt allhis former joy returning, his fears and anxieties dissipating, and hegazed at Cosette, saying: &ldquo;Oh! what a kindly wound! Oh! what a goodmisfortune!&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette on perceiving that her father was ill, had deserted the pavilionand again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard. Shepassed nearly all her days beside Jean Valjean and read to him the bookswhich he desired. Generally they were books of travel. Jean Valjean wasundergoing a new birth; his happiness was reviving in these ineffablerays; the Luxembourg, the prowling young stranger, Cosette&rsquo;s coldness,&mdash;allthese clouds upon his soul were growing dim. He had reached the pointwhere he said to himself: &ldquo;I imagined all that. I am an old fool.&rdquo;</p><p>His happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of the Thénardiersmade in the Jondrette hovel, unexpected as it was, had, after a fashion,glided over him unnoticed. He had succeeded in making his escape; alltrace of him was lost&mdash;what more did he care for! he only thought ofthose wretched beings to pity them. &ldquo;Here they are in prison, andhenceforth they will be incapacitated for doing any harm,&rdquo; he thought,&ldquo;but what a lamentable family in distress!&rdquo;</p><p>As for the hideous vision of the Barrière du Maine, Cosette had notreferred to it again.</p><p>Sister Sainte-Mechtilde had taught Cosette music in the convent; Cosettehad the voice of a linnet with a soul, and sometimes, in the evening, inthe wounded man&rsquo;s humble abode, she warbled melancholy songs whichdelighted Jean Valjean.</p><p>Spring came; the garden was so delightful at that season of the year, thatJean Valjean said to Cosette:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You never go there; I want you to stroll in it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As you like, father,&rdquo; said Cosette.</p><p>And for the sake of obeying her father, she resumed her walks in thegarden, generally alone, for, as we have mentioned, Jean Valjean, who wasprobably afraid of being seen through the fence, hardly ever went there.</p><p>Jean Valjean&rsquo;s wound had created a diversion.</p><p>When Cosette saw that her father was suffering less, that he wasconvalescing, and that he appeared to be happy, she experienced acontentment which she did not even perceive, so gently and naturally hadit come. Then, it was in the month of March, the days were growing longer,the winter was departing, the winter always bears away with it a portionof our sadness; then came April, that daybreak of summer, fresh as dawnalways is, gay like every childhood; a little inclined to weep at timeslike the new-born being that it is. In that month, nature has charminggleams which pass from the sky, from the trees, from the meadows and theflowers into the heart of man.</p><p>Cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of thatApril joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself. Insensibly, andwithout her suspecting the fact, the blackness departed from her spirit.In spring, sad souls grow light, as light falls into cellars at midday.Cosette was no longer sad. However, though this was so, she did notaccount for it to herself. In the morning, about ten o&rsquo;clock, afterbreakfast, when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the gardenfor a quarter of an hour, and when she was pacing up and down in thesunlight in front of the steps, supporting his left arm for him, she didnot perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was happy.</p><p>Jean Valjean, intoxicated, beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! What a good wound!&rdquo; he repeated in a whisper.</p><p>And he felt grateful to the Thénardiers.</p><p>His wound once healed, he resumed his solitary twilight strolls.</p><p>It is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in that fashionin the uninhabited regions of Paris without meeting with some adventure.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0242" id="link2HCH0242"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;MOTHER PLUTARQUE FINDS NO DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING APHENOMENON</h3><p>One evening, little Gavroche had had nothing to eat; he remembered that hehad not dined on the preceding day either; this was becoming tiresome. Heresolved to make an effort to secure some supper. He strolled out beyondthe Salpêtrière into deserted regions; that is where windfalls are to befound; where there is no one, one always finds something. He reached asettlement which appeared to him to be the village of Austerlitz.</p><p>In one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden hauntedby an old man and an old woman, and in that garden, a passable apple-tree.Beside the apple-tree stood a sort of fruit-house, which was not securelyfastened, and where one might contrive to get an apple. One apple is asupper; one apple is life. That which was Adam&rsquo;s ruin might proveGavroche&rsquo;s salvation. The garden abutted on a solitary, unpaved lane,bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses; the gardenwas separated from it by a hedge.</p><p>Gavroche directed his steps towards this garden; he found the lane, herecognized the apple-tree, he verified the fruit-house, he examined thehedge; a hedge means merely one stride. The day was declining, there wasnot even a cat in the lane, the hour was propitious. Gavroche began theoperation of scaling the hedge, then suddenly paused. Some one was talkingin the garden. Gavroche peeped through one of the breaks in the hedge.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0033" id="linkimage-0033"></a><img src="images/4b4-1-succor-from-below.jpg" alt="Succor from Below" width="100%" /></div><p>A couple of paces distant, at the foot of the hedge on the other side,exactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would have beenmade, there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench, and onthis bench was seated the old man of the garden, while the old woman wasstanding in front of him. The old woman was grumbling. Gavroche, who wasnot very discreet, listened.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Mabeuf!&rdquo; said the old woman.</p><p>&ldquo;Mabeuf!&rdquo; thought Gavroche, &ldquo;that name is a perfect farce.&rdquo;</p><p>The old man who was thus addressed, did not stir. The old woman repeated:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Mabeuf!&rdquo;</p><p>The old man, without raising his eyes from the ground, made up his mind toanswer:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it, Mother Plutarque?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mother Plutarque!&rdquo; thought Gavroche, &ldquo;another farcical name.&rdquo;</p><p>Mother Plutarque began again, and the old man was forced to accept theconversation:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The landlord is not pleased.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We owe three quarters rent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In three months, we shall owe him for four quarters.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He says that he will turn you out to sleep.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The green-grocer insists on being paid. She will no longer leave herfagots. What will you warm yourself with this winter? We shall have nowood.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There is the sun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The butcher refuses to give credit; he will not let us have any moremeat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is quite right. I do not digest meat well. It is too heavy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What shall we have for dinner?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bread.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The baker demands a settlement, and says, &lsquo;no money, no bread.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What will you eat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have apples in the apple-room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, Monsieur, we can&rsquo;t live like that without money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have none.&rdquo;</p><p>The old woman went away, the old man remained alone. He fell into thought.Gavroche became thoughtful also. It was almost dark.</p><p>The first result of Gavroche&rsquo;s meditation was, that instead of scaling thehedge, he crouched down under it. The branches stood apart a little at thefoot of the thicket.</p><p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; exclaimed Gavroche mentally, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a nook!&rdquo; and he curled up init. His back was almost in contact with Father Mabeuf&rsquo;s bench. He couldhear the octogenarian breathe.</p><p>Then, by way of dinner, he tried to sleep.</p><p>It was a cat-nap, with one eye open. While he dozed, Gavroche kept on thewatch.</p><p>The twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth, and the lane formed alivid line between two rows of dark bushes.</p><p>All at once, in this whitish band, two figures made their appearance. Onewas in front, the other some distance in the rear.</p><p>&ldquo;There come two creatures,&rdquo; muttered Gavroche.</p><p>The first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois, who was bent andthoughtful, dressed more than plainly, and who was walking slowly becauseof his age, and strolling about in the open evening air.</p><p>The second was straight, firm, slender. It regulated its pace by that ofthe first; but in the voluntary slowness of its gait, suppleness andagility were discernible. This figure had also something fierce anddisquieting about it, the whole shape was that of what was then called <i>anelegant</i>; the hat was of good shape, the coat black, well cut, probably offine cloth, and well fitted in at the waist. The head was held erect witha sort of robust grace, and beneath the hat the pale profile of a youngman could be made out in the dim light. The profile had a rose in itsmouth. This second form was well known to Gavroche; it was Montparnasse.</p><p>He could have told nothing about the other, except that he was arespectable old man.</p><p>Gavroche immediately began to take observations.</p><p>One of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with theother. Gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events. The bedroomhad turned into a hiding-place at a very opportune moment.</p><p>Montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour, in such a place, betokenedsomething threatening. Gavroche felt his gamin&rsquo;s heart moved withcompassion for the old man.</p><p>What was he to do? Interfere? One weakness coming to the aid of another!It would be merely a laughing matter for Montparnasse. Gavroche did notshut his eyes to the fact that the old man, in the first place, and thechild in the second, would make but two mouthfuls for that redoubtableruffian eighteen years of age.</p><p>While Gavroche was deliberating, the attack took place, abruptly andhideously. The attack of the tiger on the wild ass, the attack of thespider on the fly. Montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose, boundedupon the old man, seized him by the collar, grasped and clung to him, andGavroche with difficulty restrained a scream. A moment later one of thesemen was underneath the other, groaning, struggling, with a knee of marbleupon his breast. Only, it was not just what Gavroche had expected. The onewho lay on the earth was Montparnasse; the one who was on top was the oldman. All this took place a few paces distant from Gavroche.</p><p>The old man had received the shock, had returned it, and that in such aterrible fashion, that in a twinkling, the assailant and the assailed hadexchanged rôles.</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a hearty veteran!&rdquo; thought Gavroche.</p><p>He could not refrain from clapping his hands. But it was applause wasted.It did not reach the combatants, absorbed and deafened as they were, eachby the other, as their breath mingled in the struggle.</p><p>Silence ensued. Montparnasse ceased his struggles. Gavroche indulged inthis aside: &ldquo;Can he be dead!&rdquo;</p><p>The goodman had not uttered a word, nor given vent to a cry. He rose tohis feet, and Gavroche heard him say to Montparnasse:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Get up.&rdquo;</p><p>Montparnasse rose, but the goodman held him fast. Montparnasse&rsquo;s attitudewas the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has been caught bya sheep.</p><p>Gavroche looked on and listened, making an effort to reinforce his eyeswith his ears. He was enjoying himself immensely.</p><p>He was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of aspectator. He was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowed fromthe darkness an indescribably tragic accent. The goodman questioned,Montparnasse replied.</p><p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nineteen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are strong and healthy. Why do you not work?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It bores me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is your trade?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;An idler.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Speak seriously. Can anything be done for you? What would you like tobe?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A thief.&rdquo;</p><p>A pause ensued. The old man seemed absorbed in profound thought. He stoodmotionless, and did not relax his hold on Montparnasse.</p><p>Every moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in thetwitchings of a wild beast caught in a snare. He gave a jerk, tried acrook of the knee, twisted his limbs desperately, and made efforts toescape.</p><p>The old man did not appear to notice it, and held both his arms with onehand, with the sovereign indifference of absolute force.</p><p>The old man&rsquo;s reverie lasted for some time, then, looking steadily atMontparnasse, he addressed to him in a gentle voice, in the midst of thedarkness where they stood, a solemn harangue, of which Gavroche did notlose a single syllable:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My child, you are entering, through indolence, on one of the mostlaborious of lives. Ah! You declare yourself to be an idler! prepare totoil. There is a certain formidable machine, have you seen it? It is therolling-mill. You must be on your guard against it, it is crafty andferocious; if it catches hold of the skirt of your coat, you will be drawnin bodily. That machine is laziness. Stop while there is yet time, andsave yourself! Otherwise, it is all over with you; in a short time youwill be among the gearing. Once entangled, hope for nothing more. Toil,lazybones! there is no more repose for you! The iron hand of implacabletoil has seized you. You do not wish to earn your living, to have a task,to fulfil a duty! It bores you to be like other men? Well! You will bedifferent. Labor is the law; he who rejects it will find ennui historment. You do not wish to be a workingman, you will be a slave. Toillets go of you on one side only to grasp you again on the other. You donot desire to be its friend, you shall be its negro slave. Ah! You wouldhave none of the honest weariness of men, you shall have the sweat of thedamned. Where others sing, you will rattle in your throat. You will seeafar off, from below, other men at work; it will seem to you that they areresting. The laborer, the harvester, the sailor, the blacksmith, willappear to you in glory like the blessed spirits in paradise. What radiancesurrounds the forge! To guide the plough, to bind the sheaves, is joy. Thebark at liberty in the wind, what delight! Do you, lazy idler, delve, dragon, roll, march! Drag your halter. You are a beast of burden in the teamof hell! Ah! To do nothing is your object. Well, not a week, not a day,not an hour shall you have free from oppression. You will be able to liftnothing without anguish. Every minute that passes will make your musclescrack. What is a feather to others will be a rock to you. The simplestthings will become steep acclivities. Life will become monstrous all aboutyou. To go, to come, to breathe, will be just so many terrible labors.Your lungs will produce on you the effect of weighing a hundred pounds.Whether you shall walk here rather than there, will become a problem thatmust be solved. Any one who wants to go out simply gives his door a push,and there he is in the open air. If you wish to go out, you will beobliged to pierce your wall. What does every one who wants to step intothe street do? He goes downstairs; you will tear up your sheets, littleby little you will make of them a rope, then you will climb out of yourwindow, and you will suspend yourself by that thread over an abyss, and itwill be night, amid storm, rain, and the hurricane, and if the rope is tooshort, but one way of descending will remain to you, to fall. To drophap-hazard into the gulf, from an unknown height, on what? On what isbeneath, on the unknown. Or you will crawl up a chimney-flue, at the riskof burning; or you will creep through a sewer-pipe, at the risk ofdrowning; I do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask, ofthe stones which you will have to take up and replace twenty times a day,of the plaster that you will have to hide in your straw pallet. A lockpresents itself; the bourgeois has in his pocket a key made by alocksmith. If you wish to pass out, you will be condemned to execute aterrible work of art; you will take a large sou, you will cut it in twoplates; with what tools? You will have to invent them. That is yourbusiness. Then you will hollow out the interior of these plates, takinggreat care of the outside, and you will make on the edges a thread, sothat they can be adjusted one upon the other like a box and its cover. Thetop and bottom thus screwed together, nothing will be suspected. To theoverseers it will be only a sou; to you it will be a box. What will youput in this box? A small bit of steel. A watch-spring, in which you willhave cut teeth, and which will form a saw. With this saw, as long as apin, and concealed in a sou, you will cut the bolt of the lock, you willsever bolts, the padlock of your chain, and the bar at your window, andthe fetter on your leg. This masterpiece finished, this prodigyaccomplished, all these miracles of art, address, skill, and patienceexecuted, what will be your recompense if it becomes known that you arethe author? The dungeon. There is your future. What precipices areidleness and pleasure! Do you know that to do nothing is a melancholyresolution? To live in idleness on the property of society! to be useless,that is to say, pernicious! This leads straight to the depth ofwretchedness. Woe to the man who desires to be a parasite! He will becomevermin! Ah! So it does not please you to work? Ah! You have but onethought, to drink well, to eat well, to sleep well. You will drink water,you will eat black bread, you will sleep on a plank with a fetter whosecold touch you will feel on your flesh all night long, riveted to yourlimbs. You will break those fetters, you will flee. That is well. You willcrawl on your belly through the brushwood, and you will eat grass like thebeasts of the forest. And you will be recaptured. And then you will passyears in a dungeon, riveted to a wall, groping for your jug that you maydrink, gnawing at a horrible loaf of darkness which dogs would not touch,eating beans that the worms have eaten before you. You will be awood-louse in a cellar. Ah! Have pity on yourself, you miserable youngchild, who were sucking at nurse less than twenty years ago, and who have,no doubt, a mother still alive! I conjure you, listen to me, I entreatyou. You desire fine black cloth, varnished shoes, to have your haircurled and sweet-smelling oils on your locks, to please low women, to behandsome. You will be shaven clean, and you will wear a red blouse andwooden shoes. You want rings on your fingers, you will have an ironnecklet on your neck. If you glance at a woman, you will receive a blow.And you will enter there at the age of twenty. And you will come out atfifty! You will enter young, rosy, fresh, with brilliant eyes, and allyour white teeth, and your handsome, youthful hair; you will come outbroken, bent, wrinkled, toothless, horrible, with white locks! Ah! my poorchild, you are on the wrong road; idleness is counselling you badly; thehardest of all work is thieving. Believe me, do not undertake that painfulprofession of an idle man. It is not comfortable to become a rascal. It isless disagreeable to be an honest man. Now go, and ponder on what I havesaid to you. By the way, what did you want of me? My purse? Here it is.&rdquo;</p><p>And the old man, releasing Montparnasse, put his purse in the latter&rsquo;shand; Montparnasse weighed it for a moment, after which he allowed it toslide gently into the back pocket of his coat, with the same mechanicalprecaution as though he had stolen it.</p><p>All this having been said and done, the goodman turned his back andtranquilly resumed his stroll.</p><p>&ldquo;The blockhead!&rdquo; muttered Montparnasse.</p><p>Who was this goodman? The reader has, no doubt, already divined.</p><p>Montparnasse watched him with amazement, as he disappeared in the dusk.This contemplation was fatal to him.</p><p>While the old man was walking away, Gavroche drew near.</p><p>Gavroche had assured himself, with a sidelong glance, that Father Mabeufwas still sitting on his bench, probably sound asleep. Then the gaminemerged from his thicket, and began to crawl after Montparnasse in thedark, as the latter stood there motionless. In this manner he came up toMontparnasse without being seen or heard, gently insinuated his hand intothe back pocket of that frock-coat of fine black cloth, seized the purse,withdrew his hand, and having recourse once more to his crawling, heslipped away like an adder through the shadows. Montparnasse, who had noreason to be on his guard, and who was engaged in thought for the firsttime in his life, perceived nothing. When Gavroche had once more attainedthe point where Father Mabeuf was, he flung the purse over the hedge, andfled as fast as his legs would carry him.</p><p>The purse fell on Father Mabeuf&rsquo;s foot.

Nature, spring, youth, love for her father, the gayety ofthe birds and flowers, caused something almost resembling forgetfulness tofilter gradually, drop by drop, into that soul, which was so virgin and soyoung. Was the fire wholly extinct there? Or was it merely that layers ofashes had formed? The truth is, that she hardly felt the painful andburning spot any longer.</p><p>One day she suddenly thought of Marius: &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I no longerthink of him.&rdquo;</p><p>That same week, she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers, with awasp-like waist, a delicious uniform, the cheeks of a young girl, a swordunder his arm, waxed moustaches, and a glazed schapka, passing the gate.Moreover, he had light hair, prominent blue eyes, a round face, was vain,insolent and good-looking; quite the reverse of Marius. He had a cigar inhis mouth. Cosette thought that this officer doubtless belonged to theregiment in barracks in the Rue de Babylone.</p><p>On the following day, she saw him pass again. She took note of the hour.</p><p>From that time forth, was it chance? she saw him pass nearly every day.</p><p>The officer&rsquo;s comrades perceived that there was, in that &ldquo;badly kept&rdquo; garden, behind that malicious rococo fence, a very pretty creature, whowas almost always there when the handsome lieutenant,&mdash;who is notunknown to the reader, and whose name was Théodule Gillenormand,&mdash;passedby.</p><p>&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; they said to him, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a little creature there who ismaking eyes at you, look.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have I the time,&rdquo; replied the lancer, &ldquo;to look at all the girls who lookat me?&rdquo;</p><p>This was at the precise moment when Marius was descending heavily towardsagony, and was saying: &ldquo;If I could but see her before I die!&rdquo;&mdash;Hadhis wish been realized, had he beheld Cosette at that moment gazing at thelancer, he would not have been able to utter a word, and he would haveexpired with grief.</p><p>Whose fault was it? No one&rsquo;s.</p><p>Marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves in sorrowand there abide; Cosette was one of those persons who plunge into sorrowand emerge from it again.</p><p>Cosette was, moreover, passing through that dangerous period, the fatalphase of feminine reverie abandoned to itself, in which the isolated heartof a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling, as chancedirects, to the capital of a marble column or to the post of a wine-shop:A rapid and decisive moment, critical for every orphan, be she rich orpoor, for wealth does not prevent a bad choice; misalliances are made invery high circles, real misalliance is that of souls; and as many anunknown young man, without name, without birth, without fortune, is amarble column which bears up a temple of grand sentiments and grand ideas,so such and such a man of the world satisfied and opulent, who haspolished boots and varnished words, if looked at not outside, but inside,a thing which is reserved for his wife, is nothing more than a blockobscurely haunted by violent, unclean, and vinous passions; the post of adrinking-shop.</p><p>What did Cosette&rsquo;s soul contain?

This, asthe reader knows, happened from time to time, at very long intervals. Heremained absent a day or two days at the utmost. Where did he go? No oneknew, not even Cosette. Once only, on the occasion of one of thesedepartures, she had accompanied him in a hackney-coach as far as a littleblind-alley at the corner of which she read: <i>Impasse de la Planchette</i>.There he alighted, and the coach took Cosette back to the Rue de Babylone.It was usually when money was lacking in the house that Jean Valjean tookthese little trips.</p><p>So Jean Valjean was absent. He had said: &ldquo;I shall return in three days.&rdquo;</p><p>That evening, Cosette was alone in the drawing-room. In order to get ridof her ennui, she had opened her piano-organ, and had begun to sing,accompanying herself the while, the chorus from <i>Euryanthe</i>: &ldquo;Hunters astrayin the wood!&rdquo; which is probably the most beautiful thing in all the sphereof music. When she had finished, she remained wrapped in thought.</p><p>All at once, it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps in thegarden.</p><p>It could not be her father, he was absent; it could not be Toussaint, shewas in bed, and it was ten o&rsquo;clock at night.</p><p>She stepped to the shutter of the drawing-room, which was closed, and laidher ear against it.</p><p>It seemed to her that it was the tread of a man, and that he was walkingvery softly.</p><p>She mounted rapidly to the first floor, to her own chamber, opened a smallwicket in her shutter, and peeped into the garden. The moon was at thefull. Everything could be seen as plainly as by day.</p><p>There was no one there.</p><p>She opened the window. The garden was absolutely calm, and all that wasvisible was that the street was deserted as usual.</p><p>Cosette thought that she had been mistaken. She thought that she had hearda noise. It was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and magnificentchorus of Weber, which lays open before the mind terrified depths, whichtrembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest, and in which one hears thecrackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread of the huntsmen ofwhom one catches a glimpse through the twilight.</p><p>She thought no more about it.</p><p>Moreover, Cosette was not very timid by nature. There flowed in her veinssome of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who runs barefoot.It will be remembered that she was more of a lark than a dove. There was afoundation of wildness and bravery in her.</p><p>On the following day, at an earlier hour, towards nightfall, she wasstrolling in the garden. In the midst of the confused thoughts whichoccupied her, she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound similarto that of the preceding evening, as though some one were walking beneaththe trees in the dusk, and not very far from her; but she told herselfthat nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass as the friction oftwo branches which have moved from side to side, and she paid no heed toit. Besides, she could see nothing.</p><p>She emerged from &ldquo;the thicket&rdquo;; she had still to cross a small lawn toregain the steps.</p><p>The moon, which had just risen behind her, cast Cosette&rsquo;s shadow in frontof her upon this lawn, as she came out from the shrubbery.</p><p>Cosette halted in alarm.</p><p>Beside her shadow, the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf anothershadow, which was particularly startling and terrible, a shadow which hada round hat.</p><p>It was the shadow of a man, who must have been standing on the border ofthe clump of shrubbery, a few paces in the rear of Cosette.</p><p>She stood for a moment without the power to speak, or cry, or call, orstir, or turn her head.</p><p>Then she summoned up all her courage, and turned round resolutely.</p><p>There was no one there.</p><p>She glanced on the ground. The figure had disappeared.</p><p>She re-entered the thicket, searched the corners boldly, went as far asthe gate, and found nothing.</p><p>She felt herself absolutely chilled with terror. Was this anotherhallucination? What! Two days in succession! One hallucination might pass,but two hallucinations? The disquieting point about it was, that theshadow had assuredly not been a phantom. Phantoms do not wear round hats.</p><p>On the following day Jean Valjean returned. Cosette told him what shethought she had heard and seen. She wanted to be reassured and to see herfather shrug his shoulders and say to her: &ldquo;You are a little goose.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean grew anxious.</p><p>&ldquo;It cannot be anything,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>He left her under some pretext, and went into the garden, and she saw himexamining the gate with great attention.</p><p>During the night she woke up; this time she was sure, and she distinctlyheard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window.She ran to her little wicket and opened it. In point of fact, there was aman in the garden, with a large club in his hand. Just as she was about toscream, the moon lighted up the man&rsquo;s profile. It was her father. Shereturned to her bed, saying to herself: &ldquo;He is very uneasy!&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in thegarden. Cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter.</p><p>On the third night, the moon was on the wane, and had begun to rise later;at one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, possibly, she heard a loud burst oflaughter and her father&rsquo;s voice calling her:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette!&rdquo;</p><p>She jumped out of bed, threw on her dressing-gown, and opened her window.</p><p>Her father was standing on the grass-plot below.</p><p>&ldquo;I have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;look,there is your shadow with the round hat.&rdquo;</p><p>And he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon, and whichdid indeed, bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a man wearinga round hat. It was the shadow produced by a chimney-pipe of sheet iron,with a hood, which rose above a neighboring roof.</p><p>Cosette joined in his laughter, all her lugubrious suppositions wereallayed, and the next morning, as she was at breakfast with her father,she made merry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of ironchimney-pots.</p><p>Jean Valjean became quite tranquil once more; as for Cosette, she did notpay much attention to the question whether the chimney-pot was really inthe direction of the shadow which she had seen, or thought she had seen,and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the sky.</p><p>She did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney-pot whichis afraid of being caught in the act, and which retires when some onelooks at its shadow, for the shadow had taken the alarm when Cosette hadturned round, and Cosette had thought herself very sure of this. Cosette&rsquo;sserenity was fully restored. The proof appeared to her to be complete, andit quite vanished from her mind, whether there could possibly be any onewalking in the garden during the evening or at night.</p><p>A few days later, however, a fresh incident occurred.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0245" id="link2HCH0245"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;ENRICHED WITH COMMENTARIES BY TOUSSAINT</h3><p>In the garden, near the railing on the street, there was a stone bench,screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke-elms, butwhich could, in case of necessity, be reached by an arm from the outside,past the trees and the gate.</p><p>One evening during that same month of April, Jean Valjean had gone out;Cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown. The breeze wasblowing briskly in the trees, Cosette was meditating; an objectlesssadness was taking possession of her little by little, that invinciblesadness evoked by the evening, and which arises, perhaps, who knows, fromthe mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour.</p><p>Perhaps Fantine was within that shadow.</p><p>Cosette rose, slowly made the tour of the garden, walking on the grassdrenched in dew, and saying to herself, through the species of melancholysomnambulism in which she was plunged: &ldquo;Really, one needs wooden shoes forthe garden at this hour. One takes cold.&rdquo;</p><p>She returned to the bench.</p><p>As she was about to resume her seat there, she observed on the spot whichshe had quitted, a tolerably large stone which had, evidently, not beenthere a moment before.</p><p>Cosette gazed at the stone, asking herself what it meant. All at once theidea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all byitself, that some one had placed it there, that an arm had been thrustthrough the railing, and this idea appeared to alarm her. This time, thefear was genuine; the stone was there. No doubt was possible; she did nottouch it, fled without glancing behind her, took refuge in the house, andimmediately closed with shutter, bolt, and bar the door-like windowopening on the flight of steps. She inquired of Toussaint:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Has my father returned yet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not yet, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p><p>[We have already noted once for all the fact that Toussaint stuttered. Maywe be permitted to dispense with it for the future. The musical notationof an infirmity is repugnant to us.]</p><p>Jean Valjean, a thoughtful man, and given to nocturnal strolls, oftenreturned quite late at night.</p><p>&ldquo;Toussaint,&rdquo; went on Cosette, &ldquo;are you careful to thoroughly barricade theshutters opening on the garden, at least with bars, in the evening, and toput the little iron things in the little rings that close them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! be easy on that score, Miss.&rdquo;</p><p>Toussaint did not fail in her duty, and Cosette was well aware of thefact, but she could not refrain from adding:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It is so solitary here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So far as that is concerned,&rdquo; said Toussaint, &ldquo;it is true. We might beassassinated before we had time to say <i>ouf!</i> And Monsieur does not sleep inthe house, to boot. But fear nothing, Miss, I fasten the shutters up likeprisons. Lone women! That is enough to make one shudder, I believe you!Just imagine, what if you were to see men enter your chamber at night andsay: &lsquo;Hold your tongue!&rsquo; and begin to cut your throat. It&rsquo;s not the dyingso much; you die, for one must die, and that&rsquo;s all right; it&rsquo;s theabomination of feeling those people touch you. And then, their knives;they can&rsquo;t be able to cut well with them! Ah, good gracious!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; said Cosette. &ldquo;Fasten everything thoroughly.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette, terrified by the melodrama improvised by Toussaint, and possibly,also, by the recollection of the apparitions of the past week, whichrecurred to her memory, dared not even say to her: &ldquo;Go and look at thestone which has been placed on the bench!&rdquo; for fear of opening the gardengate and allowing &ldquo;the men&rdquo; to enter. She saw that all the doors andwindows were carefully fastened, made Toussaint go all over the house fromgarret to cellar, locked herself up in her own chamber, bolted her door,looked under her couch, went to bed and slept badly. All night long shesaw that big stone, as large as a mountain and full of caverns.</p><p>At sunrise,&mdash;the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh atall our terrors of the past night, and our laughter is in directproportion to our terror which they have caused,&mdash;at sunrise Cosette,when she woke, viewed her fright as a nightmare, and said to herself:&ldquo;What have I been thinking of? It is like the footsteps that I thought Iheard a week or two ago in the garden at night! It is like the shadow ofthe chimney-pot! Am I becoming a coward?&rdquo; The sun, which was glowingthrough the crevices in her shutters, and turning the damask curtainscrimson, reassured her to such an extent that everything vanished from herthoughts, even the stone.</p><p>&ldquo;There was no more a stone on the bench than there was a man in a roundhat in the garden; I dreamed about the stone, as I did all the rest.&rdquo;</p><p>She dressed herself, descended to the garden, ran to the bench, and brokeout in a cold perspiration. The stone was there.</p><p>But this lasted only for a moment. That which is terror by night iscuriosity by day.</p><p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;come, let us see what it is.&rdquo;</p><p>She lifted the stone, which was tolerably large. Beneath it was somethingwhich resembled a letter. It was a white envelope. Cosette seized it.There was no address on one side, no seal on the other. Yet the envelope,though unsealed, was not empty. Papers could be seen inside.</p><p>Cosette examined it. It was no longer alarm, it was no longer curiosity;it was a beginning of anxiety.</p><p>Cosette drew from the envelope its contents, a little notebook of paper,each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine andrather pretty handwriting, as Cosette thought.</p><p>Cosette looked for a name; there was none. To whom was this addressed? Toher, probably, since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench. Fromwhom did it come? An irresistible fascination took possession of her; shetried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which were trembling in herhand, she gazed at the sky, the street, the acacias all bathed in light,the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof, and then her glancesuddenly fell upon the manuscript, and she said to herself that she mustknow what it contained.</p><p>This is what she read.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0246" id="link2HCH0246"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;A HEART BENEATH A STONE</h3><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0034" id="linkimage-0034"></a><img src="images/4b4-5-cossette-after-letter.jpg" alt="Cosette With Letter" width="100%" /></div><p>The reduction of the universe to a single being, the expansion of a singlebeing even to God, that is love.</p><p>Love is the salutation of the angels to the stars.</p><p>How sad is the soul, when it is sad through love!</p><p>What a void in the absence of the being who, by herself alone fills theworld! Oh! how true it is that the beloved being becomes God. One couldcomprehend that God might be jealous of this had not God the Father of allevidently made creation for the soul, and the soul for love.</p><p>The glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac curtainis sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams.</p><p>God is behind everything, but everything hides God. Things are black,creatures are opaque. To love a being is to render that being transparent.</p><p>Certain thoughts are prayers. There are moments when, whatever theattitude of the body may be, the soul is on its knees.</p><p>Parted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices, whichpossess, however, a reality of their own. They are prevented from seeingeach other, they cannot write to each other; they discover a multitude ofmysterious means to correspond. They send each other the song of thebirds, the perfume of the flowers, the smiles of children, the light ofthe sun, the sighings of the breeze, the rays of stars, all creation. Andwhy not? All the works of God are made to serve love. Love is sufficientlypotent to charge all nature with its messages.</p><p>Oh Spring! Thou art a letter that I write to her.</p><p>The future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds. Love, thatis the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity. In the infinite, theinexhaustible is requisite.</p><p>Love participates of the soul itself. It is of the same nature. Like it,it is the divine spark; like it, it is incorruptible, indivisible,imperishable. It is a point of fire that exists within us, which isimmortal and infinite, which nothing can confine, and which nothing canextinguish. We feel it burning even to the very marrow of our bones, andwe see it beaming in the very depths of heaven.</p><p>Oh Love! Adorations! voluptuousness of two minds which understand eachother, of two hearts which exchange with each other, of two glances whichpenetrate each other! You will come to me, will you not, bliss! strolls bytwos in the solitudes! Blessed and radiant days! I have sometimes dreamedthat from time to time hours detached themselves from the lives of theangels and came here below to traverse the destinies of men.</p><p>God can add nothing to the happiness of those who love, except to givethem endless duration. After a life of love, an eternity of love is, infact, an augmentation; but to increase in intensity even the ineffablefelicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world, is impossible,even to God. God is the plenitude of heaven; love is the plenitude of man.</p><p>You look at a star for two reasons, because it is luminous, and because itis impenetrable. You have beside you a sweeter radiance and a greatermystery, woman.</p><p>All of us, whoever we may be, have our respirable beings. We lack air andwe stifle. Then we die. To die for lack of love is horrible. Suffocationof the soul.</p><p>When love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic unity,the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are concerned; theyare no longer anything more than the two boundaries of the same destiny;they are no longer anything but the two wings of the same spirit. Love,soar.</p><p>On the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she walks,you are lost, you love. But one thing remains for you to do: to think ofher so intently that she is constrained to think of you.</p><p>What love commences can be finished by God alone.</p><p>True love is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost or ahandkerchief found, and eternity is required for its devotion and itshopes. It is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitelylittle.</p><p>If you are a stone, be adamant; if you are a plant, be the sensitiveplant; if you are a man, be love.</p><p>Nothing suffices for love. We have happiness, we desire paradise; wepossess paradise, we desire heaven.</p><p>Oh ye who love each other, all this is contained in love. Understand howto find it there. Love has contemplation as well as heaven, and more thanheaven, it has voluptuousness.</p><p>&ldquo;Does she still come to the Luxembourg?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is the churchwhere she attends mass, is it not?&rdquo; &ldquo;She no longer comes here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Does shestill live in this house?&rdquo; &ldquo;She has moved away.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where has she gone todwell?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She did not say.&rdquo;</p><p>What a melancholy thing not to know the address of one&rsquo;s soul!</p><p>Love has its childishness, other passions have their pettinesses. Shame onthe passions which belittle man! Honor to the one which makes a child ofhim!</p><p>There is one strange thing, do you know it? I dwell in the night. There isa being who carried off my sky when she went away.</p><p>Oh! would that we were lying side by side in the same grave, hand in hand,and from time to time, in the darkness, gently caressing a finger,&mdash;thatwould suffice for my eternity!</p><p>Ye who suffer because ye love, love yet more. To die of love, is to livein it.</p><p>Love. A sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture.There is ecstasy in agony.</p><p>Oh joy of the birds! It is because they have nests that they sing.</p><p>Love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise.</p><p>Deep hearts, sage minds, take life as God has made it; it is a long trial,an incomprehensible preparation for an unknown destiny. This destiny, thetrue one, begins for a man with the first step inside the tomb. Thensomething appears to him, and he begins to distinguish the definitive. Thedefinitive, meditate upon that word. The living perceive the infinite; thedefinitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead. In the meanwhile,love and suffer, hope and contemplate. Woe, alas! to him who shall haveloved only bodies, forms, appearances! Death will deprive him of all. Tryto love souls, you will find them again.</p><p>I encountered in the street, a very poor young man who was in love. Hishat was old, his coat was worn, his elbows were in holes; water trickledthrough his shoes, and the stars through his soul.</p><p>What a grand thing it is to be loved! What a far grander thing it is tolove! The heart becomes heroic, by dint of passion. It is no longercomposed of anything but what is pure; it no longer rests on anything thatis not elevated and great. An unworthy thought can no more germinate init, than a nettle on a glacier. The serene and lofty soul, inaccessible tovulgar passions and emotions, dominating the clouds and the shades of thisworld, its follies, its lies, its hatreds, its vanities, its miseries,inhabits the blue of heaven, and no longer feels anything but profound andsubterranean shocks of destiny, as the crests of mountains feel the shocksof earthquake.</p><p>If there did not exist some one who loved, the sun would become extinct.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0247" id="link2HCH0247"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;COSETTE AFTER THE LETTER</h3><p>As Cosette read, she gradually fell into thought. At the very moment whenshe raised her eyes from the last line of the note-book, the handsomeofficer passed triumphantly in front of the gate,&mdash;it was his hour;Cosette thought him hideous.</p><p>She resumed her contemplation of the book. It was written in the mostcharming of chirography, thought Cosette; in the same hand, but withdivers inks, sometimes very black, again whitish, as when ink has beenadded to the inkstand, and consequently on different days. It was, then, amind which had unfolded itself there, sigh by sigh, irregularly, withoutorder, without choice, without object, hap-hazard. Cosette had never readanything like it. This manuscript, in which she already perceived morelight than obscurity, produced upon her the effect of a half-opensanctuary. Each one of these mysterious lines shone before her eyes andinundated her heart with a strange radiance. The education which she hadreceived had always talked to her of the soul, and never of love, verymuch as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the flame. Thismanuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealed to her all oflove, sorrow, destiny, life, eternity, the beginning, the end. It was asif a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon her a handful of rays oflight. In these few lines she felt a passionate, ardent, generous, honestnature, a sacred will, an immense sorrow, and an immense despair, asuffering heart, an ecstasy fully expanded. What was this manuscript? Aletter. A letter without name, without address, without date, withoutsignature, pressing and disinterested, an enigma composed of truths, amessage of love made to be brought by an angel and read by a virgin, anappointment made beyond the bounds of earth, the love-letter of a phantomto a shade. It was an absent one, tranquil and dejected, who seemed readyto take refuge in death and who sent to the absent love, his lady, thesecret of fate, the key of life, love. This had been written with one footin the grave and one finger in heaven. These lines, which had fallen oneby one on the paper, were what might be called drops of soul.</p><p>Now, from whom could these pages come? Who could have penned them?</p><p>Cosette did not hesitate a moment. One man only.</p><p>He!</p><p>Day had dawned once more in her spirit; all had reappeared. She felt anunheard-of joy, and a profound anguish. It was he! he who had written! hewas there! it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing! Whileshe was forgetful of him, he had found her again! But had she forgottenhim? No, never! She was foolish to have thought so for a single moment.She had always loved him, always adored him. The fire had been smothered,and had smouldered for a time, but she saw all plainly now; it had butmade headway, and now it had burst forth afresh, and had inflamed herwhole being. This note-book was like a spark which had fallen from thatother soul into hers. She felt the conflagration starting up once more.</p><p>She imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript: &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;how perfectly I recognize all that! That is what I had alreadyread in his eyes.&rdquo; As she was finishing it for the third time, LieutenantThéodule passed the gate once more, and rattled his spurs upon thepavement. Cosette was forced to raise her eyes. She thought him insipid,silly, stupid, useless, foppish, displeasing, impertinent, and extremelyugly. The officer thought it his duty to smile at her.</p><p>She turned away as in shame and indignation. She would gladly have thrownsomething at his head.</p><p>She fled, re-entered the house, and shut herself up in her chamber toperuse the manuscript once more, to learn it by heart, and to dream. Whenshe had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in her bosom.</p><p>All was over, Cosette had fallen back into deep, seraphic love. The abyssof Eden had yawned once more.</p><p>All day long, Cosette remained in a sort of bewilderment. She scarcelythought, her ideas were in the state of a tangled skein in her brain, shecould not manage to conjecture anything, she hoped through a tremor, what?vague things. She dared make herself no promises, and she did not wish torefuse herself anything. Flashes of pallor passed over her countenance,and shivers ran through her frame. It seemed to her, at intervals, thatshe was entering the land of chimæras; she said to herself: &ldquo;Is thisreality?&rdquo; Then she felt of the dear paper within her bosom under her gown,she pressed it to her heart, she felt its angles against her flesh; and ifJean Valjean had seen her at the moment, he would have shuddered in thepresence of that luminous and unknown joy, which overflowed from beneathher eyelids.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;it is certainly he!

Shearranged her hair in the most becoming manner, and she put on a dresswhose bodice had received one snip of the scissors too much, and which,through this slope, permitted a view of the beginning of her throat, andwas, as young girls say, &ldquo;a trifle indecent.&rdquo; It was not in the leastindecent, but it was prettier than usual. She made her toilet thus withoutknowing why she did so.</p><p>Did she mean to go out? No.</p><p>Was she expecting a visitor? No.</p><p>At dusk, she went down to the garden. Toussaint was busy in her kitchen,which opened on the back yard.</p><p>She began to stroll about under the trees, thrusting aside the branchesfrom time to time with her hand, because there were some which hung verylow.</p><p>In this manner she reached the bench.</p><p>The stone was still there.</p><p>She sat down, and gently laid her white hand on this stone as though shewished to caress and thank it.</p><p>All at once, she experienced that indefinable impression which oneundergoes when there is some one standing behind one, even when she doesnot see the person.</p><p>She turned her head and rose to her feet.</p><p>It was he.</p><p>His head was bare. He appeared to have grown thin and pale. His blackclothes were hardly discernible. The twilight threw a wan light on hisfine brow, and covered his eyes in shadows. Beneath a veil of incomparablesweetness, he had something about him that suggested death and night. Hisface was illuminated by the light of the dying day, and by the thought ofa soul that is taking flight.</p><p>He seemed to be not yet a ghost, and he was no longer a man.</p><p>He had flung away his hat in the thicket, a few paces distant.</p><p>Cosette, though ready to swoon, uttered no cry. She retreated slowly, forshe felt herself attracted. He did not stir. By virtue of somethingineffable and melancholy which enveloped him, she felt the look in hiseyes which she could not see.</p><p>Cosette, in her retreat, encountered a tree and leaned against it. Had itnot been for this tree, she would have fallen.</p><p>Then she heard his voice, that voice which she had really never heard,barely rising above the rustle of the leaves, and murmuring:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardon me, here I am. My heart is full. I could not live on as I wasliving, and I have come. Have you read what I placed there on the bench?Do you recognize me at all? Have no fear of me. It is a long time, youremember the day, since you looked at me at the Luxembourg, near theGladiator. And the day when you passed before me? It was on the 16th ofJune and the 2d of July. It is nearly a year ago. I have not seen you fora long time. I inquired of the woman who let the chairs, and she told methat she no longer saw you. You lived in the Rue de l&rsquo;Ouest, on the thirdfloor, in the front apartments of a new house,&mdash;you see that I know!I followed you. What else was there for me to do? And then youdisappeared. I thought I saw you pass once, while I was reading thenewspapers under the arcade of the Odéon. I ran after you. But no. It wasa person who had a bonnet like yours. At night I came hither. Do not beafraid, no one sees me. I come to gaze upon your windows near at hand. Iwalk very softly, so that you may not hear, for you might be alarmed. Theother evening I was behind you, you turned round, I fled. Once, I heardyou singing. I was happy. Did it affect you because I heard you singingthrough the shutters? That could not hurt you. No, it is not so? You see,you are my angel! Let me come sometimes; I think that I am going to die.If you only knew! I adore you. Forgive me, I speak to you, but I do notknow what I am saying; I may have displeased you; have I displeased you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! my mother!&rdquo; said she.</p><p>And she sank down as though on the point of death.</p><p>He grasped her, she fell, he took her in his arms, he pressed her close,without knowing what he was doing. He supported her, though he wastottering himself. It was as though his brain were full of smoke;lightnings darted between his lips; his ideas vanished; it seemed to himthat he was accomplishing some religious act, and that he was committing aprofanation. Moreover, he had not the least passion for this lovely womanwhose force he felt against his breast. He was beside himself with love.</p><p>She took his hand and laid it on her heart. He felt the paper there, hestammered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You love me, then?&rdquo;</p><p>She replied in a voice so low that it was no longer anything more than abarely audible breath:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Hush! Thou knowest it!&rdquo;</p><p>And she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb and intoxicatedyoung man.</p><p>He fell upon the bench, and she beside him. They had no words more. Thestars were beginning to gleam. How did it come to pass that their lipsmet? How comes it to pass that the birds sing, that snow melts, that therose unfolds, that May expands, that the dawn grows white behind the blacktrees on the shivering crest of the hills?</p><p>A kiss, and that was all.</p><p>Both started, and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes.</p><p>They felt neither the cool night, nor the cold stone, nor the damp earth,nor the wet grass; they looked at each other, and their hearts were fullof thoughts. They had clasped hands unconsciously.</p><p>She did not ask him, she did not even wonder, how he had entered there,and how he had made his way into the garden. It seemed so simple to herthat he should be there!</p><p>From time to time, Marius&rsquo; knee touched Cosette&rsquo;s knee, and both shivered.</p><p>At intervals, Cosette stammered a word. Her soul fluttered on her lipslike a drop of dew on a flower.</p><p>Little by little they began to talk to each other. Effusion followedsilence, which is fulness. The night was serene and splendid overhead.These two beings, pure as spirits, told each other everything, theirdreams, their intoxications, their ecstasies, their chimæras, theirweaknesses, how they had adored each other from afar, how they had longedfor each other, their despair when they had ceased to see each other. Theyconfided to each other in an ideal intimacy, which nothing could augment,their most secret and most mysterious thoughts. They related to eachother, with candid faith in their illusions, all that love, youth, and theremains of childhood which still lingered about them, suggested to theirminds. Their two hearts poured themselves out into each other in suchwise, that at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it was the young manwho had the young girl&rsquo;s soul, and the young girl who had the young man&rsquo;ssoul. Each became permeated with the other, they were enchanted with eachother, they dazzled each other.</p><p>When they had finished, when they had told each other everything, she laidher head on his shoulder and asked him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Marius,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And yours?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Cosette.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0286" id="link2H_4_0286"></a>BOOK SIXTH&mdash;LITTLE GAVROCHE</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0249" id="link2HCH0249"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE MALICIOUS PLAYFULNESS OF THE WIND</h3><p>Since 1823, when the tavern of Montfermeil was on the way to shipwreck andwas being gradually engulfed, not in the abyss of a bankruptcy, but in thecesspool of petty debts, the Thénardier pair had had two other children;both males. That made five; two girls and three boys.</p><p>Madame Thénardier had got rid of the last two, while they were still youngand very small, with remarkable luck.</p><p><i>Got rid of</i> is the word. There was but a mere fragment of nature in thatwoman. A phenomenon, by the way, of which there is more than one exampleextant. Like the Maréchale de La Mothe-Houdancourt, the Thénardier was amother to her daughters only. There her maternity ended. Her hatred of thehuman race began with her own sons. In the direction of her sons her evildisposition was uncompromising, and her heart had a lugubrious wall inthat quarter. As the reader has seen, she detested the eldest; she cursedthe other two. Why? Because. The most terrible of motives, the mostunanswerable of retorts&mdash;Because. &ldquo;I have no need of a litter ofsqualling brats,&rdquo; said this mother.</p><p>Let us explain how the Thénardiers had succeeded in getting rid of theirlast two children; and even in drawing profit from the operation.</p><p>The woman Magnon, who was mentioned a few pages further back, was the sameone who had succeeded in making old Gillenormand support the two childrenwhich she had had. She lived on the Quai des Célestins, at the corner ofthis ancient street of the Petit-Musc which afforded her the opportunityof changing her evil repute into good odor. The reader will remember thegreat epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districts of the Seine inParis thirty-five years ago, and of which science took advantage to makeexperiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy of inhalations of alum, sobeneficially replaced at the present day by the external tincture ofiodine. During this epidemic, the Magnon lost both her boys, who werestill very young, one in the morning, the other in the evening of the sameday. This was a blow. These children were precious to their mother; theyrepresented eighty francs a month. These eighty francs were punctuallypaid in the name of M. Gillenormand, by collector of his rents, M. Barge,a retired tip-staff, in the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile. The children dead, theincome was at an end. The Magnon sought an expedient. In that darkfree-masonry of evil of which she formed a part, everything is known, allsecrets are kept, and all lend mutual aid. Magnon needed two children; theThénardiers had two. The same sex, the same age. A good arrangement forthe one, a good investment for the other. The little Thénardiers becamelittle Magnons. Magnon quitted the Quai des Célestins and went to live inthe Rue Clocheperce. In Paris, the identity which binds an individual tohimself is broken between one street and another.</p><p>The registry office being in no way warned, raised no objections, and thesubstitution was effected in the most simple manner in the world. Only,the Thénardier exacted for this loan of her children, ten francs a month,which Magnon promised to pay, and which she actually did pay. It isunnecessary to add that M. Gillenormand continued to perform his compact.He came to see the children every six months. He did not perceive thechange. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; Magnon said to him, &ldquo;how much they resemble you!&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier, to whom avatars were easy, seized this occasion to becomeJondrette. His two daughters and Gavroche had hardly had time to discoverthat they had two little brothers. When a certain degree of misery isreached, one is overpowered with a sort of spectral indifference, and oneregards human beings as though they were spectres. Your nearest relationsare often no more for you than vague shadowy forms, barely outlinedagainst a nebulous background of life and easily confounded again with theinvisible.</p><p>On the evening of the day when she had handed over her two little ones toMagnon, with express intention of renouncing them forever, the Thénardierhad felt, or had appeared to feel, a scruple. She said to her husband:&ldquo;But this is abandoning our children!&rdquo; Thénardier, masterful andphlegmatic, cauterized the scruple with this saying: &ldquo;Jean JacquesRousseau did even better!&rdquo; From scruples, the mother proceeded touneasiness: &ldquo;But what if the police were to annoy us? Tell me, MonsieurThénardier, is what we have done permissible?&rdquo; Thénardier replied:&ldquo;Everything is permissible. No one will see anything but true blue in it.Besides, no one has any interest in looking closely after children whohave not a sou.&rdquo;</p><p>Magnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime. She wascareful about her toilet. She shared her lodgings, which were furnished inan affected and wretched style, with a clever gallicized English thief.This English woman, who had become a naturalized Parisienne, recommendedby very wealthy relations, intimately connected with the medals in theLibrary and Mademoiselle Mar&rsquo;s diamonds, became celebrated later on injudicial accounts. She was called <i>Mamselle Miss</i>.</p><p>The two little creatures who had fallen to Magnon had no reason tocomplain of their lot. Recommended by the eighty francs, they were wellcared for, as is everything from which profit is derived; they wereneither badly clothed, nor badly fed; they were treated almost like&ldquo;little gentlemen,&rdquo;&mdash;better by their false mother than by their realone. Magnon played the lady, and talked no thieves&rsquo; slang in theirpresence.</p><p>Thus passed several years. Thénardier augured well from the fact. One day,he chanced to say to Magnon as she handed him his monthly stipend of tenfrancs: &ldquo;The father must give them some education.&rdquo;</p><p>All at once, these two poor children, who had up to that time beenprotected tolerably well, even by their evil fate, were abruptly hurledinto life and forced to begin it for themselves.</p><p>A wholesale arrest of malefactors, like that in the Jondrette garret,necessarily complicated by investigations and subsequent incarcerations,is a veritable disaster for that hideous and occult counter-society whichpursues its existence beneath public society; an adventure of thisdescription entails all sorts of catastrophes in that sombre world. TheThénardier catastrophe involved the catastrophe of Magnon.</p><p>One day, a short time after Magnon had handed to Éponine the note relatingto the Rue Plumet, a sudden raid was made by the police in the RueClocheperce; Magnon was seized, as was also Mamselle Miss; and all theinhabitants of the house, which was of a suspicious character, weregathered into the net. While this was going on, the two little boys wereplaying in the back yard, and saw nothing of the raid. When they tried toenter the house again, they found the door fastened and the house empty. Acobbler opposite called them to him, and delivered to them a paper which&ldquo;their mother&rdquo; had left for them. On this paper there was an address: <i>M.Barge, collector of rents, Rue du Roi-de-Sicile, No</i>. 8. The proprietor ofthe stall said to them: &ldquo;You cannot live here any longer. Go there. It isnearby. The first street on the left. Ask your way from this paper.&rdquo;</p><p>The children set out, the elder leading the younger, and holding in hishand the paper which was to guide them. It was cold, and his benumbedlittle fingers could not close very firmly, and they did not keep a verygood hold on the paper. At the corner of the Rue Clocheperce, a gust ofwind tore it from him, and as night was falling, the child was not able tofind it again.</p><p>They began to wander aimlessly through the streets.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0250" id="link2HCH0250"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;IN WHICH LITTLE GAVROCHE EXTRACTS PROFIT FROM NAPOLEONTHE GREAT</h3><p>Spring in Paris is often traversed by harsh and piercing breezes which donot precisely chill but freeze one; these north winds which sadden themost beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs of cold airwhich enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly fitting door orwindow. It seems as though the gloomy door of winter had remained ajar,and as though the wind were pouring through it. In the spring of 1832, theepoch when the first great epidemic of this century broke out in Europe,these north gales were more harsh and piercing than ever. It was a dooreven more glacial than that of winter which was ajar. It was the door ofthe sepulchre. In these winds one felt the breath of the cholera.</p><p>From a meteorological point of view, these cold winds possessed thispeculiarity, that they did not preclude a strong electric tension.Frequent storms, accompanied by thunder and lightning, burst forth at thisepoch.</p><p>One evening, when these gales were blowing rudely, to such a degree thatJanuary seemed to have returned and that the bourgeois had resumed theircloaks, Little Gavroche, who was always shivering gayly under his rags,was standing as though in ecstasy before a wig-maker&rsquo;s shop in thevicinity of the Orme-Saint-Gervais. He was adorned with a woman&rsquo;s woollenshawl, picked up no one knows where, and which he had converted into aneck comforter. Little Gavroche appeared to be engaged in intentadmiration of a wax bride, in a low-necked dress, and crowned withorange-flowers, who was revolving in the window, and displaying her smileto passers-by, between two argand lamps; but in reality, he was taking anobservation of the shop, in order to discover whether he could not &ldquo;prig&rdquo; from the shop-front a cake of soap, which he would then proceed to sellfor a sou to a &ldquo;hair-dresser&rdquo; in the suburbs. He had often managed tobreakfast off of such a roll. He called his species of work, for which hepossessed special aptitude, &ldquo;shaving barbers.&rdquo;</p><p>While contemplating the bride, and eyeing the cake of soap, he mutteredbetween his teeth: &ldquo;Tuesday. It was not Tuesday. Was it Tuesday? Perhapsit was Tuesday. Yes, it was Tuesday.&rdquo;</p><p>No one has ever discovered to what this monologue referred.</p><p>Yes, perchance, this monologue had some connection with the last occasionon which he had dined, three days before, for it was now Friday.</p><p>The barber in his shop, which was warmed by a good stove, was shaving acustomer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy, thatfreezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in hispockets, but whose mind was evidently unsheathed.</p><p>While Gavroche was scrutinizing the shop-window and the cakes of windsorsoap, two children of unequal stature, very neatly dressed, and stillsmaller than himself, one apparently about seven years of age, the otherfive, timidly turned the handle and entered the shop, with a request forsomething or other, alms possibly, in a plaintive murmur which resembled agroan rather than a prayer. They both spoke at once, and their words wereunintelligible because sobs broke the voice of the younger, and the teethof the elder were chattering with cold. The barber wheeled round with afurious look, and without abandoning his razor, thrust back the elder withhis left hand and the younger with his knee, and slammed his door, saying:&ldquo;The idea of coming in and freezing everybody for nothing!&rdquo;</p><p>The two children resumed their march in tears. In the meantime, a cloudhad risen; it had begun to rain.</p><p>Little Gavroche ran after them and accosted them:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, brats?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know where we are to sleep,&rdquo; replied the elder.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; said Gavroche. &ldquo;A great matter, truly. The idea of bawlingabout that. They must be greenies!&rdquo;</p><p>And adopting, in addition to his superiority, which was rather bantering,an accent of tender authority and gentle patronage:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Come along with me, young &rsquo;uns!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the elder.</p><p>And the two children followed him as they would have followed anarchbishop. They had stopped crying.</p><p>Gavroche led them up the Rue Saint-Antoine in the direction of theBastille.</p><p>As Gavroche walked along, he cast an indignant backward glance at thebarber&rsquo;s shop.</p><p>&ldquo;That fellow has no heart, the whiting,&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-35" name="linknoteref-35" id="linknoteref-35">35</a> he muttered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s anEnglishman.&rdquo;</p><p>A woman who caught sight of these three marching in a file, with Gavrocheat their head, burst into noisy laughter. This laugh was wanting inrespect towards the group.</p><p>&ldquo;Good day, Mamselle Omnibus,&rdquo; said Gavroche to her.</p><p>An instant later, the wig-maker occurred to his mind once more, and headded:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am making a mistake in the beast; he&rsquo;s not a whiting, he&rsquo;s a serpent.Barber, I&rsquo;ll go and fetch a locksmith, and I&rsquo;ll have a bell hung to yourtail.&rdquo;</p><p>This wig-maker had rendered him aggressive. As he strode over a gutter, heapostrophized a bearded portress who was worthy to meet Faust on theBrocken, and who had a broom in her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so you are going out with your horse?&rdquo;</p><p>And thereupon, he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian.</p><p>&ldquo;You scamp!&rdquo; shouted the furious pedestrian.</p><p>Gavroche elevated his nose above his shawl.</p><p>&ldquo;Is Monsieur complaining?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of you!&rdquo; ejaculated the man.</p><p>&ldquo;The office is closed,&rdquo; said Gavroche, &ldquo;I do not receive any morecomplaints.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meanwhile, as he went on up the street, he perceived a beggar-girl,thirteen or fourteen years old, and clad in so short a gown that her kneeswere visible, lying thoroughly chilled under a porte-cochère. The littlegirl was getting to be too old for such a thing. Growth does play thesetricks. The petticoat becomes short at the moment when nudity becomesindecent.</p><p>&ldquo;Poor girl!&rdquo; said Gavroche. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t even trousers. Hold on, takethis.&rdquo;</p><p>And unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck, heflung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar-girl, where thescarf became a shawl once more.</p><p>The child stared at him in astonishment, and received the shawl insilence. When a certain stage of distress has been reached in his misery,the poor man no longer groans over evil, no longer returns thanks forgood.</p><p>That done: &ldquo;Brrr!&rdquo; said Gavroche, who was shivering more than SaintMartin, for the latter retained one-half of his cloak.</p><p>At this <i>brrr!</i> the downpour of rain, redoubled in its spite, becamefurious. The wicked skies punish good deeds.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, come now!&rdquo; exclaimed Gavroche, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the meaning of this? It&rsquo;sre-raining! Good Heavens, if it goes on like this, I shall stop mysubscription.&rdquo;</p><p>And he set out on the march once more.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he resumed, casting a glance at the beggar-girl, as shecoiled up under the shawl, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s got a famous peel.&rdquo;</p><p>And looking up at the clouds he exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Caught!&rdquo;</p><p>The two children followed close on his heels.</p><p>As they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices, which indicate abaker&rsquo;s shop, for bread is put behind bars like gold, Gavroche turnedround:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, by the way, brats, have we dined?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the elder, &ldquo;we have had nothing to eat since thismorning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you have neither father nor mother?&rdquo; resumed Gavroche majestically.</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse us, sir, we have a papa and a mamma, but we don&rsquo;t know where theyare.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sometimes that&rsquo;s better than knowing where they are,&rdquo; said Gavroche, whowas a thinker.</p><p>&ldquo;We have been wandering about these two hours,&rdquo; continued the elder, &ldquo;wehave hunted for things at the corners of the streets, but we have foundnothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; ejaculated Gavroche, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the dogs who eat everything.&rdquo;</p><p>He went on, after a pause:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! we have lost our authors. We don&rsquo;t know what we have done with them.This should not be, gamins. It&rsquo;s stupid to let old people stray off likethat. Come now! we must have a snooze all the same.&rdquo;</p><p>However, he asked them no questions. What was more simple than that theyshould have no dwelling place!</p><p>The elder of the two children, who had almost entirely recovered theprompt heedlessness of childhood, uttered this exclamation:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer, all the same. Mamma told us that she would take us to get ablessed spray on Palm Sunday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bosh,&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>&ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; resumed the elder, &ldquo;is a lady who lives with Mamselle Miss.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tanflûte!&rdquo; retorted Gavroche.</p><p>Meanwhile he had halted, and for the last two minutes he had been feelingand fumbling in all sorts of nooks which his rags contained.</p><p>At last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied,but which was triumphant, in reality.</p><p>&ldquo;Let us be calm, young &rsquo;uns. Here&rsquo;s supper for three.&rdquo;</p><p>And from one of his pockets he drew forth a sou.</p><p>Without allowing the two urchins time for amazement, he pushed both ofthem before him into the baker&rsquo;s shop, and flung his sou on the counter,crying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Boy! five centimes&rsquo; worth of bread.&rdquo;</p><p>The baker, who was the proprietor in person, took up a loaf and a knife.</p><p>&ldquo;In three pieces, my boy!&rdquo; went on Gavroche.</p><p>And he added with dignity:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There are three of us.&rdquo;</p><p>And seeing that the baker, after scrutinizing the three customers, hadtaken down a black loaf, he thrust his finger far up his nose with aninhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the greatFrederick&rsquo;s snuff on the tip of his thumb, and hurled this indignantapostrophe full in the baker&rsquo;s face:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Keksekça?&rdquo;</p><p>Those of our readers who might be tempted to espy in this interpellationof Gavroche&rsquo;s to the baker a Russian or a Polish word, or one of thosesavage cries which the Yoways and the Botocudos hurl at each other frombank to bank of a river, athwart the solitudes, are warned that it is aword which they [our readers] utter every day, and which takes the placeof the phrase: &ldquo;Qu&rsquo;est-ce que c&rsquo;est que cela?&rdquo; The baker understoodperfectly, and replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Well! It&rsquo;s bread, and very good bread of the second quality.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You mean <i>larton brutal</i> [black bread]!&rdquo; retorted Gavroche, calmly andcoldly disdainful. &ldquo;White bread, boy! white bread [<i>larton savonné</i>]! I&rsquo;mstanding treat.&rdquo;</p><p>The baker could not repress a smile, and as he cut the white bread hesurveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked Gavroche.</p><p>&ldquo;Come, now, baker&rsquo;s boy!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what are you taking our measure likethat for?&rdquo;</p><p>All three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure.</p><p>When the bread was cut, the baker threw the sou into his drawer, andGavroche said to the two children:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Grub away.&rdquo;</p><p>The little boys stared at him in surprise.</p><p>Gavroche began to laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! hullo, that&rsquo;s so! they don&rsquo;t understand yet, they&rsquo;re too small.&rdquo;</p><p>And he repeated:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Eat away.&rdquo;</p><p>At the same time, he held out a piece of bread to each of them.</p><p>And thinking that the elder, who seemed to him the more worthy of hisconversation, deserved some special encouragement and ought to be relievedfrom all hesitation to satisfy his appetite, he added, as he handed himthe largest share:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ram that into your muzzle.&rdquo;</p><p>One piece was smaller than the others; he kept this for himself.</p><p>The poor children, including Gavroche, were famished. As they tore theirbread apart in big mouthfuls, they blocked up the shop of the baker, who,now that they had paid their money, looked angrily at them.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into the street again,&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>They set off once more in the direction of the Bastille.</p><p>From time to time, as they passed the lighted shop-windows, the smallesthalted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was suspended from hisneck by a cord.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, he is a very green &rsquo;un,&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>Then, becoming thoughtful, he muttered between his teeth:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;All the same, if I had charge of the babes I&rsquo;d lock &rsquo;em up better thanthat.&rdquo;</p><p>Just as they were finishing their morsel of bread, and had reached theangle of that gloomy Rue des Ballets, at the other end of which the lowand threatening wicket of La Force was visible:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Hullo, is that you, Gavroche?&rdquo; said some one.</p><p>&ldquo;Hullo, is that you, Montparnasse?&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>A man had just accosted the street urchin, and the man was no other thanMontparnasse in disguise, with blue spectacles, but recognizable toGavroche.</p><p>&ldquo;The bow-wows!&rdquo; went on Gavroche, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got a hide the color of alinseed plaster, and blue specs like a doctor. You&rsquo;re putting on style,‘pon my word!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; ejaculated Montparnasse, &ldquo;not so loud.&rdquo;</p><p>And he drew Gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops.</p><p>The two little ones followed mechanically, holding each other by the hand.</p><p>When they were ensconced under the arch of a porte-cochère, sheltered fromthe rain and from all eyes:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know where I&rsquo;m going?&rdquo; demanded Montparnasse.</p><p>&ldquo;To the Abbey of Ascend-with-Regret,&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-36" name="linknoteref-36" id="linknoteref-36">36</a> replied Gavroche.</p><p>&ldquo;Joker!&rdquo;</p><p>And Montparnasse went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find Babet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Gavroche, &ldquo;so her name is Babet.&rdquo;</p><p>Montparnasse lowered his voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Not she, he.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Babet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Babet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought he was buckled.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He has undone the buckle,&rdquo; replied Montparnasse.</p><p>And he rapidly related to the gamin how, on the morning of that very day,Babet, having been transferred to La Conciergerie, had made his escape, byturning to the left instead of to the right in &ldquo;the police office.&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche expressed his admiration for this skill.</p><p>&ldquo;What a dentist!&rdquo; he cried.</p><p>Montparnasse added a few details as to Babet&rsquo;s flight, and ended with:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s not all.&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche, as he listened, had seized a cane that Montparnasse held in hishand, and mechanically pulled at the upper part, and the blade of a daggermade its appearance.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, pushing the dagger back in haste, &ldquo;you have broughtalong your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois.&rdquo;</p><p>Montparnasse winked.</p><p>&ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo; resumed Gavroche, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;re going to have a bout with thebobbies?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; replied Montparnasse with an indifferent air. &ldquo;It&rsquo;salways a good thing to have a pin about one.&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche persisted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you up to to-night?&rdquo;</p><p>Again Montparnasse took a grave tone, and said, mouthing every syllable:&ldquo;Things.&rdquo;</p><p>And abruptly changing the conversation:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;By the way!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Something happened t&rsquo;other day. Fancy. I meet a bourgeois. He makes me apresent of a sermon and his purse. I put it in my pocket. A minute later,I feel in my pocket. There&rsquo;s nothing there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Except the sermon,&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>&ldquo;But you,&rdquo; went on Montparnasse, &ldquo;where are you bound for now?&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche pointed to his two protégés, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put these infants to bed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Whereabouts is the bed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At my house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your house?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;At my house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you have a lodging?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And where is your lodging?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the elephant,&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>Montparnasse, though not naturally inclined to astonishment, could notrestrain an exclamation.</p><p>&ldquo;In the elephant!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, yes, in the elephant!&rdquo; retorted Gavroche. &ldquo;Kekçaa?&rdquo;</p><p>This is another word of the language which no one writes, and which everyone speaks.</p><p>Kekçaa signifies: <i>Qu’est que c&rsquo;est que cela a? </i> [What&rsquo;s the matter withthat?]</p><p>The urchin&rsquo;s profound remark recalled Montparnasse to calmness and goodsense. He appeared to return to better sentiments with regard toGavroche&rsquo;s lodging.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;yes, the elephant. Is it comfortable there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Gavroche. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really bully there. There ain&rsquo;t any draughts,as there are under the bridges.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How do you get in?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I get in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So there is a hole?&rdquo; demanded Montparnasse.</p><p>&ldquo;Parbleu! I should say so. But you mustn&rsquo;t tell. It&rsquo;s between the forelegs. The bobbies haven&rsquo;t seen it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you climb up? Yes, I understand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A turn of the hand, cric, crac, and it&rsquo;s all over, no one there.&rdquo;</p><p>After a pause, Gavroche added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall have a ladder for these children.&rdquo;</p><p>Montparnasse burst out laughing:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Where the devil did you pick up those young &rsquo;uns?&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche replied with great simplicity:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;They are some brats that a wig-maker made me a present of.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, Montparnasse had fallen to thinking:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You recognized me very readily,&rdquo; he muttered.</p><p>He took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more than twoquills wrapped in cotton, and thrust one up each of his nostrils. Thisgave him a different nose.</p><p>&ldquo;That changes you,&rdquo; remarked Gavroche, &ldquo;you are less homely so, you oughtto keep them on all the time.&rdquo;</p><p>Montparnasse was a handsome fellow, but Gavroche was a tease.</p><p>&ldquo;Seriously,&rdquo; demanded Montparnasse, &ldquo;how do you like me so?&rdquo;</p><p>The sound of his voice was different also. In a twinkling, Montparnassehad become unrecognizable.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Do play Porrichinelle for us!&rdquo; exclaimed Gavroche.</p><p>The two children, who had not been listening up to this point, beingoccupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses, drew nearat this name, and stared at Montparnasse with dawning joy and admiration.</p><p>Unfortunately, Montparnasse was troubled.</p><p>He laid his hand on Gavroche&rsquo;s shoulder, and said to him, emphasizing hiswords: &ldquo;Listen to what I tell you, boy! if I were on the square with mydog, my knife, and my wife, and if you were to squander ten sous on me, Iwouldn&rsquo;t refuse to work, but this isn&rsquo;t Shrove Tuesday.&rdquo;</p><p>This odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin. He wheeled roundhastily, darted his little sparkling eyes about him with profoundattention, and perceived a police sergeant standing with his back to thema few paces off. Gavroche allowed an: &ldquo;Ah! good!&rdquo; to escape him, butimmediately suppressed it, and shaking Montparnasse&rsquo;s hand:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, good evening,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going off to my elephant with mybrats. Supposing that you should need me some night, you can come and huntme up there. I lodge on the entresol. There is no porter. You will inquirefor Monsieur Gavroche.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Montparnasse.</p><p>And they parted, Montparnasse betaking himself in the direction of theGrève, and Gavroche towards the Bastille. The little one of five, draggedalong by his brother who was dragged by Gavroche, turned his head backseveral times to watch &ldquo;Porrichinelle&rdquo; as he went.</p><p>The ambiguous phrase by means of which Montparnasse had warned Gavroche ofthe presence of the policeman, contained no other talisman than theassonance <i>dig</i> repeated five or six times in different forms. Thissyllable, <i>dig</i>, uttered alone or artistically mingled with the words of aphrase, means: &ldquo;Take care, we can no longer talk freely.&rdquo; There wasbesides, in Montparnasse&rsquo;s sentence, a literary beauty which was lost uponGavroche, that is <i>mon dogue, ma dague et ma digue</i>, a slang expression ofthe Temple, which signifies my dog, my knife, and my wife, greatly invogue among clowns and the red-tails in the great century when Molièrewrote and Callot drew.</p><p>Twenty years ago, there was still to be seen in the southwest corner ofthe Place de la Bastille, near the basin of the canal, excavated in theancient ditch of the fortress-prison, a singular monument, which hasalready been effaced from the memories of Parisians, and which deserved toleave some trace, for it was the idea of a &ldquo;member of the Institute, theGeneral-in-chief of the army of Egypt.&rdquo;</p><p>We say monument, although it was only a rough model. But this modelitself, a marvellous sketch, the grandiose skeleton of an idea ofNapoleon&rsquo;s, which successive gusts of wind have carried away and thrown,on each occasion, still further from us, had become historical and hadacquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its provisionalaspect. It was an elephant forty feet high, constructed of timber andmasonry, bearing on its back a tower which resembled a house, formerlypainted green by some dauber, and now painted black by heaven, the wind,and time. In this deserted and unprotected corner of the place, the broadbrow of the colossus, his trunk, his tusks, his tower, his enormouscrupper, his four feet, like columns produced, at night, under the starryheavens, a surprising and terrible form. It was a sort of symbol ofpopular force. It was sombre, mysterious, and immense. It was some mighty,visible phantom, one knew not what, standing erect beside the invisiblespectre of the Bastille.</p><p>Few strangers visited this edifice, no passer-by looked at it. It wasfalling into ruins; every season the plaster which detached itself fromits sides formed hideous wounds upon it. &ldquo;The ædiles,&rdquo; as the expressionran in elegant dialect, had forgotten it ever since 1814. There it stoodin its corner, melancholy, sick, crumbling, surrounded by a rottenpalisade, soiled continually by drunken coachmen; cracks meandered athwartits belly, a lath projected from its tail, tall grass flourished betweenits legs; and, as the level of the place had been rising all around it fora space of thirty years, by that slow and continuous movement whichinsensibly elevates the soil of large towns, it stood in a hollow, and itlooked as though the ground were giving way beneath it. It was unclean,despised, repulsive, and superb, ugly in the eyes of the bourgeois,melancholy in the eyes of the thinker. There was something about it of thedirt which is on the point of being swept out, and something of themajesty which is on the point of being decapitated. As we have said, atnight, its aspect changed. Night is the real element of everything that isdark. As soon as twilight descended, the old elephant became transfigured;he assumed a tranquil and redoubtable appearance in the formidableserenity of the shadows. Being of the past, he belonged to night; andobscurity was in keeping with his grandeur.</p><p>This rough, squat, heavy, hard, austere, almost misshapen, but assuredlymajestic monument, stamped with a sort of magnificent and savage gravity,has disappeared, and left to reign in peace, a sort of gigantic stove,ornamented with its pipe, which has replaced the sombre fortress with itsnine towers, very much as the bourgeoisie replaces the feudal classes. Itis quite natural that a stove should be the symbol of an epoch in which apot contains power. This epoch will pass away, people have already begunto understand that, if there can be force in a boiler, there can be noforce except in the brain; in other words, that which leads and drags onthe world, is not locomotives, but ideas. Harness locomotives to ideas,&mdash;thatis well done; but do not mistake the horse for the rider.</p><p>At all events, to return to the Place de la Bastille, the architect ofthis elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster; thearchitect of the stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing out ofbronze.</p><p>This stove-pipe, which has been baptized by a sonorous name, and calledthe column of July, this monument of a revolution that miscarried, wasstill enveloped in 1832, in an immense shirt of woodwork, which we regret,for our part, and by a vast plank enclosure, which completed the task ofisolating the elephant.</p><p>It was towards this corner of the place, dimly lighted by the reflectionof a distant street lamp, that the gamin guided his two &ldquo;brats.&rdquo;</p><p>The reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here and to remind himthat we are dealing with simple reality, and that twenty years ago, thetribunals were called upon to judge, under the charge of vagabondage, andmutilation of a public monument, a child who had been caught asleep inthis very elephant of the Bastille. This fact noted, we proceed.</p><p>On arriving in the vicinity of the colossus, Gavroche comprehended theeffect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely small,and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared, infants.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he entered through a gap in the fence into the elephant&rsquo;s enclosureand helped the young ones to clamber through the breach. The two children,somewhat frightened, followed Gavroche without uttering a word, andconfided themselves to this little Providence in rags which had given thembread and had promised them a shelter.</p><p>There, extended along the fence, lay a ladder which by day served thelaborers in the neighboring timber-yard. Gavroche raised it withremarkable vigor, and placed it against one of the elephant&rsquo;s forelegs.Near the point where the ladder ended, a sort of black hole in the bellyof the colossus could be distinguished.</p><p>Gavroche pointed out the ladder and the hole to his guests, and said tothem:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Climb up and go in.&rdquo;</p><p>The two little boys exchanged terrified glances.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid, brats!&rdquo; exclaimed Gavroche.</p><p>And he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You shall see!&rdquo;</p><p>He clasped the rough leg of the elephant, and in a twinkling, withoutdeigning to make use of the ladder, he had reached the aperture. Heentered it as an adder slips through a crevice, and disappeared within,and an instant later, the two children saw his head, which looked pale,appear vaguely, on the edge of the shadowy hole, like a wan and whitishspectre.</p><p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;climb up, young &rsquo;uns! You&rsquo;ll see how snug it ishere! Come up, you!&rdquo; he said to the elder, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend you a hand.&rdquo;</p><p>The little fellows nudged each other, the gamin frightened and inspiredthem with confidence at one and the same time, and then, it was rainingvery hard. The elder one undertook the risk. The younger, on seeing hisbrother climbing up, and himself left alone between the paws of this hugebeast, felt greatly inclined to cry, but he did not dare.</p><p>The elder lad climbed, with uncertain steps, up the rungs of the ladder;Gavroche, in the meanwhile, encouraging him with exclamations like afencing-master to his pupils, or a muleteer to his mules.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid!&mdash;That&rsquo;s it!&mdash;Come on!&mdash;Put your feetthere!&mdash;Give us your hand here!&mdash;Boldly!&rdquo;</p><p>And when the child was within reach, he seized him suddenly and vigorouslyby the arm, and pulled him towards him.</p><p>&ldquo;Nabbed!&rdquo; said he.</p><p>The brat had passed through the crack.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Gavroche, &ldquo;wait for me. Be so good as to take a seat,Monsieur.&rdquo;</p><p>And making his way out of the hole as he had entered it, he slipped downthe elephant&rsquo;s leg with the agility of a monkey, landed on his feet in thegrass, grasped the child of five round the body, and planted him fairly inthe middle of the ladder, then he began to climb up behind him, shoutingto the elder:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to boost him, do you tug.&rdquo;</p><p>And in another instant, the small lad was pushed, dragged, pulled, thrust,stuffed into the hole, before he had time to recover himself, andGavroche, entering behind him, and repulsing the ladder with a kick whichsent it flat on the grass, began to clap his hands and to cry:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Here we are! Long live General Lafayette!&rdquo;</p><p>This explosion over, he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Now, young &rsquo;uns, you are in my house.&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche was at home, in fact.</p><p>Oh, unforeseen utility of the useless! Charity of great things! Goodnessof giants! This huge monument, which had embodied an idea of theEmperor&rsquo;s, had become the box of a street urchin. The brat had beenaccepted and sheltered by the colossus. The bourgeois decked out in theirSunday finery who passed the elephant of the Bastille, were fond of sayingas they scanned it disdainfully with their prominent eyes: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s thegood of that?&rdquo; It served to save from the cold, the frost, the hail, andrain, to shelter from the winds of winter, to preserve from slumber in themud which produces fever, and from slumber in the snow which producesdeath, a little being who had no father, no mother, no bread, no clothes,no refuge. It served to receive the innocent whom society repulsed. Itserved to diminish public crime. It was a lair open to one against whomall doors were shut. It seemed as though the miserable old mastodon,invaded by vermin and oblivion, covered with warts, with mould, andulcers, tottering, worm-eaten, abandoned, condemned, a sort of mendicantcolossus, asking alms in vain with a benevolent look in the midst of thecrossroads, had taken pity on that other mendicant, the poor pygmy, whoroamed without shoes to his feet, without a roof over his head, blowing onhis fingers, clad in rags, fed on rejected scraps. That was what theelephant of the Bastille was good for. This idea of Napoleon, disdained bymen, had been taken back by God. That which had been merely illustrious,had become august. In order to realize his thought, the Emperor shouldhave had porphyry, brass, iron, gold, marble; the old collection ofplanks, beams and plaster sufficed for God. The Emperor had had the dreamof a genius; in that Titanic elephant, armed, prodigious, with trunkuplifted, bearing its tower and scattering on all sides its merry andvivifying waters, he wished to incarnate the people. God had done agrander thing with it, he had lodged a child there.</p><p>The hole through which Gavroche had entered was a breach which was hardlyvisible from the outside, being concealed, as we have stated, beneath theelephant&rsquo;s belly, and so narrow that it was only cats and homelesschildren who could pass through it.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin,&rdquo; said Gavroche, &ldquo;by telling the porter that we are not athome.&rdquo;</p><p>And plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is wellacquainted with his apartments, he took a plank and stopped up theaperture.</p><p>Again Gavroche plunged into the obscurity. The children heard thecrackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle. The chemicalmatch was not yet in existence; at that epoch the Fumade steel representedprogress.</p><p>A sudden light made them blink; Gavroche had just managed to ignite one ofthose bits of cord dipped in resin which are called <i>cellar rats</i>. The<i>cellar rat</i>, which emitted more smoke than light, rendered the interior ofthe elephant confusedly visible.</p><p>Gavroche&rsquo;s two guests glanced about them, and the sensation which theyexperienced was something like that which one would feel if shut up in thegreat tun of Heidelberg, or, better still, like what Jonah must have feltin the biblical belly of the whale. An entire and gigantic skeletonappeared enveloping them. Above, a long brown beam, whence started atregular distances, massive, arching ribs, represented the vertebral columnwith its sides, stalactites of plaster depended from them like entrails,and vast spiders&rsquo; webs stretching from side to side, formed dirtydiaphragms. Here and there, in the corners, were visible large blackishspots which had the appearance of being alive, and which changed placesrapidly with an abrupt and frightened movement.</p><p>Fragments which had fallen from the elephant&rsquo;s back into his belly hadfilled up the cavity, so that it was possible to walk upon it as on afloor.</p><p>The smaller child nestled up against his brother, and whispered to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s black.&rdquo;</p><p>This remark drew an exclamation from Gavroche. The petrified air of thetwo brats rendered some shock necessary.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you are gabbling about there?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Are youscoffing at me? Are you turning up your noses? Do you want the Tuileries?Are you brutes? Come, say! I warn you that I don&rsquo;t belong to the regimentof simpletons. Ah, come now, are you brats from the Pope&rsquo;s establishment?&rdquo;</p><p>A little roughness is good in cases of fear. It is reassuring. The twochildren drew close to Gavroche.</p><p>Gavroche, paternally touched by this confidence, passed from grave togentle, and addressing the smaller:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Stupid,&rdquo; said he, accenting the insulting word, with a caressingintonation, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s outside that it is black. Outside it&rsquo;s raining, here itdoes not rain; outside it&rsquo;s cold, here there&rsquo;s not an atom of wind;outside there are heaps of people, here there&rsquo;s no one; outside thereain&rsquo;t even the moon, here there&rsquo;s my candle, confound it!&rdquo;</p><p>The two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror; butGavroche allowed them no more time for contemplation.</p><p>&ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>And he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call theend of the room.</p><p>There stood his bed.</p><p>Gavroche&rsquo;s bed was complete; that is to say, it had a mattress, a blanket,and an alcove with curtains.</p><p>The mattress was a straw mat, the blanket a rather large strip of graywoollen stuff, very warm and almost new. This is what the alcove consistedof:&mdash;</p><p>Three rather long poles, thrust into and consolidated, with the rubbishwhich formed the floor, that is to say, the belly of the elephant, two infront and one behind, and united by a rope at their summits, so as to forma pyramidal bundle. This cluster supported a trellis-work of brass wirewhich was simply placed upon it, but artistically applied, and held byfastenings of iron wire, so that it enveloped all three holes. A row ofvery heavy stones kept this network down to the floor so that nothingcould pass under it. This grating was nothing else than a piece of thebrass screens with which aviaries are covered in menageries. Gavroche&rsquo;sbed stood as in a cage, behind this net. The whole resembled an Esquimauxtent.</p><p>This trellis-work took the place of curtains.</p><p>Gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front, andthe two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart.</p><p>&ldquo;Down on all fours, brats!&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>He made his guests enter the cage with great precaution, then he crawledin after them, pulled the stones together, and closed the opening hermeticallyagain.</p><p>All three had stretched out on the mat. Gavroche still had the <i>cellar rat</i>in his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;go to sleep! I&rsquo;m going to suppress the candelabra.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; the elder of the brothers asked Gavroche, pointing to thenetting, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; answered Gavroche gravely, &ldquo;is for the rats. Go to sleep!&rdquo;</p><p>Nevertheless, he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for thebenefit of these young creatures, and he continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thing from the Jardin des Plantes. It&rsquo;s used for fierce animals.There&rsquo;s a whole shopful of them there. All you&rsquo;ve got to do is to climbover a wall, crawl through a window, and pass through a door. You can getas much as you want.&rdquo;</p><p>As he spoke, he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold of theblanket, and the little one murmured:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! how good that is! It&rsquo;s warm!&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s from the Jardin des Plantes, too,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I took that from themonkeys.&rdquo;</p><p>And, pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying, a verythick and admirably made mat, he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That belonged to the giraffe.&rdquo;</p><p>After a pause he went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The beasts had all these things. I took them away from them. It didn&rsquo;ttrouble them. I told them: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s for the elephant.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>He paused, and then resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You crawl over the walls and you don&rsquo;t care a straw for the government.So there now!&rdquo;</p><p>The two children gazed with timid and stupefied respect on this intrepidand ingenious being, a vagabond like themselves, isolated like themselves,frail like themselves, who had something admirable and all-powerful abouthim, who seemed supernatural to them, and whose physiognomy was composedof all the grimaces of an old mountebank, mingled with the most ingenuousand charming smiles.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; ventured the elder timidly, &ldquo;you are not afraid of the police,then?&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche contented himself with replying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Brat! Nobody says &lsquo;police,&rsquo; they say &lsquo;bobbies.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The smaller had his eyes wide open, but he said nothing. As he was on theedge of the mat, the elder being in the middle, Gavroche tucked theblanket round him as a mother might have done, and heightened the matunder his head with old rags, in such a way as to form a pillow for thechild. Then he turned to the elder:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey! We&rsquo;re jolly comfortable here, ain&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; replied the elder, gazing at Gavroche with the expression of asaved angel.</p><p>The two poor little children who had been soaked through, began to growwarm once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, by the way,&rdquo; continued Gavroche, &ldquo;what were you bawling about?&rdquo;</p><p>And pointing out the little one to his brother:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;A mite like that, I&rsquo;ve nothing to say about, but the idea of a big fellowlike you crying! It&rsquo;s idiotic; you looked like a calf.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gracious,&rdquo; replied the child, &ldquo;we have no lodging.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bother!&rdquo; retorted Gavroche, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;lodgings,&rsquo; you say &lsquo;crib.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And then, we were afraid of being alone like that at night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;night,&rsquo; you say &lsquo;darkmans.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the child.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; went on Gavroche, &ldquo;you must never bawl again over anything. I&rsquo;lltake care of you. You shall see what fun we&rsquo;ll have. In summer, we&rsquo;ll goto the Glacière with Navet, one of my pals, we&rsquo;ll bathe in the Gare, we&rsquo;llrun stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at Austerlitz,&mdash;thatmakes the laundresses raging. They scream, they get mad, and if you onlyknew how ridiculous they are! We&rsquo;ll go and see the man-skeleton. And thenI&rsquo;ll take you to the play. I&rsquo;ll take you to see Frédérick Lemaître. I havetickets, I know some of the actors, I even played in a piece once. Therewere a lot of us fellers, and we ran under a cloth, and that made the sea.I&rsquo;ll get you an engagement at my theatre. We&rsquo;ll go to see the savages.They ain&rsquo;t real, those savages ain&rsquo;t. They wear pink tights that go all inwrinkles, and you can see where their elbows have been darned with white.Then, we&rsquo;ll go to the Opera. We&rsquo;ll get in with the hired applauders. TheOpera claque is well managed. I wouldn&rsquo;t associate with the claque on theboulevard. At the Opera, just fancy! some of them pay twenty sous, butthey&rsquo;re ninnies. They&rsquo;re called dishclouts. And then we&rsquo;ll go to see theguillotine work. I&rsquo;ll show you the executioner. He lives in the Rue desMarais. Monsieur Sanson. He has a letter-box at his door. Ah! we&rsquo;ll havefamous fun!&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment a drop of wax fell on Gavroche&rsquo;s finger, and recalled himto the realities of life.</p><p>&ldquo;The deuce!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the wick giving out. Attention! I can&rsquo;tspend more than a sou a month on my lighting. When a body goes to bed, hemust sleep. We haven&rsquo;t the time to read M. Paul de Kock&rsquo;s romances. Andbesides, the light might pass through the cracks of the porte-cochère, andall the bobbies need to do is to see it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; remarked the elder timidly,&mdash;he alone dared talk toGavroche, and reply to him, &ldquo;a spark might fall in the straw, and we mustlook out and not burn the house down.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;burn the house down,&rsquo;&rdquo; remarked Gavroche, &ldquo;they say‘blaze the crib.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The storm increased in violence, and the heavy downpour beat upon the backof the colossus amid claps of thunder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re taken in, rain!&rdquo; saidGavroche. &ldquo;It amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of thehouse. Winter is a stupid; it wastes its merchandise, it loses its labor,it can&rsquo;t wet us, and that makes it kick up a row, old water-carrier thatit is.&rdquo;</p><p>This allusion to the thunder, all the consequences of which Gavroche, inhis character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century, accepted, wasfollowed by a broad flash of lightning, so dazzling that a hint of itentered the belly of the elephant through the crack. Almost at the sameinstant, the thunder rumbled with great fury. The two little creaturesuttered a shriek, and started up so eagerly that the network came nearbeing displaced, but Gavroche turned his bold face to them, and tookadvantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Calm down, children. Don&rsquo;t topple over the edifice. That&rsquo;s fine,first-class thunder; all right. That&rsquo;s no slouch of a streak of lightning.Bravo for the good God! Deuce take it! It&rsquo;s almost as good as it is at theAmbigu.&rdquo;</p><p>That said, he restored order in the netting, pushed the two childrengently down on the bed, pressed their knees, in order to stretch them outat full length, and exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Since the good God is lighting his candle, I can blow out mine. Now,babes, now, my young humans, you must shut your peepers. It&rsquo;s very bad notto sleep. It&rsquo;ll make you swallow the strainer, or, as they say, infashionable society, stink in the gullet. Wrap yourself up well in thehide! I&rsquo;m going to put out the light. Are you ready?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured the elder, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right. I seem to have feathers undermy head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;head,&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Gavroche, &ldquo;they say &lsquo;nut&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>The two children nestled close to each other, Gavroche finished arrangingthem on the mat, drew the blanket up to their very ears, then repeated,for the third time, his injunction in the hieratical tongue:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Shut your peepers!&rdquo;</p><p>And he snuffed out his tiny light.</p><p>Hardly had the light been extinguished, when a peculiar trembling began toaffect the netting under which the three children lay.</p><p>It consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallicsound, as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire. This wasaccompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries.</p><p>The little five-year-old boy, on hearing this hubbub overhead, and chilledwith terror, jogged his brother&rsquo;s elbow; but the elder brother had alreadyshut his peepers, as Gavroche had ordered. Then the little one, who couldno longer control his terror, questioned Gavroche, but in a very low tone,and with bated breath:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; said Gavroche, who had just closed his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the rats,&rdquo; replied Gavroche.</p><p>And he laid his head down on the mat again.</p><p>The rats, in fact, who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of theelephant, and who were the living black spots which we have alreadymentioned, had been held in awe by the flame of the candle, so long as ithad been lighted; but as soon as the cavern, which was the same as theircity, had returned to darkness, scenting what the good story-tellerPerrault calls &ldquo;fresh meat,&rdquo; they had hurled themselves in throngs onGavroche&rsquo;s tent, had climbed to the top of it, and had begun to bite themeshes as though seeking to pierce this new-fangled trap.</p><p>Still the little one could not sleep.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo; he began again.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>&ldquo;What are rats?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are mice.&rdquo;</p><p>This explanation reassured the child a little. He had seen white mice inthe course of his life, and he was not afraid of them. Nevertheless, helifted up his voice once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; said Gavroche again.</p><p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have a cat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I did have one,&rdquo; replied Gavroche, &ldquo;I brought one here, but they ateher.&rdquo;</p><p>This second explanation undid the work of the first, and the little fellowbegan to tremble again.</p><p>The dialogue between him and Gavroche began again for the fourth time:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who was it that was eaten?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The cat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And who ate the cat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The rats.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The mice?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, the rats.&rdquo;</p><p>The child, in consternation, dismayed at the thought of mice which atecats, pursued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir, would those mice eat us?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t they just!&rdquo; ejaculated Gavroche.</p><p>The child&rsquo;s terror had reached its climax. But Gavroche added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. They can&rsquo;t get in. And besides, I&rsquo;m here! Here, catchhold of my hand. Hold your tongue and shut your peepers!&rdquo;</p><p>At the same time Gavroche grasped the little fellow&rsquo;s hand across hisbrother. The child pressed the hand close to him, and felt reassured.Courage and strength have these mysterious ways of communicatingthemselves. Silence reigned round them once more, the sound of theirvoices had frightened off the rats; at the expiration of a few minutes,they came raging back, but in vain, the three little fellows were fastasleep and heard nothing more.</p><p>The hours of the night fled away. Darkness covered the vast Place de laBastille. A wintry gale, which mingled with the rain, blew in gusts, thepatrol searched all the doorways, alleys, enclosures, and obscure nooks,and in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silence beforethe elephant; the monster, erect, motionless, staring open-eyed into theshadows, had the appearance of dreaming happily over his good deed; andsheltered from heaven and from men the three poor sleeping children.</p><p>In order to understand what is about to follow, the reader must remember,that, at that epoch, the Bastille guard-house was situated at the otherend of the square, and that what took place in the vicinity of theelephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel.</p><p>Towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn, a manturned from the Rue Saint-Antoine at a run, made the circuit of theenclosure of the column of July, and glided between the palings until hewas underneath the belly of the elephant. If any light had illuminatedthat man, it might have been divined from the thorough manner in which hewas soaked that he had passed the night in the rain. Arrived beneath theelephant, he uttered a peculiar cry, which did not belong to any humantongue, and which a paroquet alone could have imitated. Twice he repeatedthis cry, of whose orthography the following barely conveys an idea:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Kirikikiou!&rdquo;</p><p>At the second cry, a clear, young, merry voice responded from the belly ofthe elephant:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p><p>Almost immediately, the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside, andgave passage to a child who descended the elephant&rsquo;s leg, and fell brisklynear the man. It was Gavroche. The man was Montparnasse.</p><p>As for his cry of <i>Kirikikiou</i>,&mdash;that was, doubtless, what the childhad meant, when he said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You will ask for Monsieur Gavroche.&rdquo;</p><p>On hearing it, he had waked with a start, had crawled out of his &ldquo;alcove,&rdquo; pushing apart the netting a little, and carefully drawing it togetheragain, then he had opened the trap, and descended.</p><p>The man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom:Montparnasse confined himself to the remark:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;We need you. Come, lend us a hand.&rdquo;</p><p>The lad asked for no further enlightenment.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>And both took their way towards the Rue Saint-Antoine, whence Montparnassehad emerged, winding rapidly through the long file of market-gardeners&rsquo;carts which descend towards the markets at that hour.</p><p>The market-gardeners, crouching, half-asleep, in their wagons, amid thesalads and vegetables, enveloped to their very eyes in their mufflers onaccount of the beating rain, did not even glance at these strangepedestrians.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0251" id="link2HCH0251"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT</h3><p>This is what had taken place that same night at the La Force:&mdash;</p><p>An escape had been planned between Babet, Brujon, Guelemer, andThénardier, although Thénardier was in close confinement. Babet hadarranged the matter for his own benefit, on the same day, as the readerhas seen from Montparnasse&rsquo;s account to Gavroche. Montparnasse was to helpthem from outside.</p><p>Brujon, after having passed a month in the punishment cell, had had time,in the first place, to weave a rope, in the second, to mature a plan. Informer times, those severe places where the discipline of the prisondelivers the convict into his own hands, were composed of four stonewalls, a stone ceiling, a flagged pavement, a camp bed, a grated window,and a door lined with iron, and were called <i>dungeons</i>; but the dungeon wasjudged to be too terrible; nowadays they are composed of an iron door, agrated window, a camp bed, a flagged pavement, four stone walls, and astone ceiling, and are called <i>chambers of punishment</i>. A little lightpenetrates towards midday. The inconvenient point about these chamberswhich, as the reader sees, are not dungeons, is that they allow thepersons who should be at work to think.</p><p>So Brujon meditated, and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with arope. As he had the name of being very dangerous in the Charlemagnecourtyard, he was placed in the New Building. The first thing he found inthe New Building was Guelemer, the second was a nail; Guelemer, that is tosay, crime; a nail, that is to say, liberty. Brujon, of whom it is hightime that the reader should have a complete idea, was, with an appearanceof delicate health and a profoundly premeditated languor, a polished,intelligent sprig, and a thief, who had a caressing glance, and anatrocious smile. His glance resulted from his will, and his smile from hisnature. His first studies in his art had been directed to roofs. He hadmade great progress in the industry of the men who tear off lead, whoplunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the process called <i>doublepickings</i>.</p><p>The circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarlyfavorable for an attempt at escape, was that the roofers were re-layingand re-jointing, at that very moment, a portion of the slates on theprison. The Saint-Bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated fromthe Charlemagne and the Saint-Louis courts. Up above there werescaffoldings and ladders; in other words, bridges and stairs in thedirection of liberty.</p><p>The New Building, which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be seenanywhere in the world, was the weak point in the prison. The walls wereeaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the authorities had been obligedto line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood, becausestones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on the prisonersin their beds. In spite of this antiquity, the authorities committed theerror of confining in the New Building the most troublesome prisoners, ofplacing there &ldquo;the hard cases,&rdquo; as they say in prison parlance.</p><p>The New Building contained four dormitories, one above the other, and atop story which was called the Bel-Air (Fine-Air). A large chimney-flue,probably from some ancient kitchen of the Dukes de la Force, started fromthe ground floor, traversed all four stories, cut the dormitories, where itfigured as a flattened pillar, into two portions, and finally pierced theroof.</p><p>Guelemer and Brujon were in the same dormitory. They had been placed, byway of precaution, on the lower story. Chance ordained that the heads oftheir beds should rest against the chimney.</p><p>Thénardier was directly over their heads in the top story known asFine-Air. The pedestrian who halts on the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine,after passing the barracks of the firemen, in front of the porte-cochèreof the bathing establishment, beholds a yard full of flowers and shrubs inwooden boxes, at the extremity of which spreads out a little white rotundawith two wings, brightened up with green shutters, the bucolic dream ofJean Jacques.</p><p>Not more than ten years ago, there rose above that rotunda an enormousblack, hideous, bare wall by which it was backed up.</p><p>This was the outer wall of La Force.</p><p>This wall, beside that rotunda, was Milton viewed through Berquin.</p><p>Lofty as it was, this wall was overtopped by a still blacker roof, whichcould be seen beyond. This was the roof of the New Building. There onecould descry four dormer-windows, guarded with bars; they were the windowsof the Fine-Air.</p><p>A chimney pierced the roof; this was the chimney which traversed thedormitories.</p><p>The Bel-Air, that top story of the New Building, was a sort of large hall,with a Mansard roof, guarded with triple gratings and double doors ofsheet iron, which were studded with enormous bolts. When one entered fromthe north end, one had on one&rsquo;s left the four dormer-windows, on one&rsquo;sright, facing the windows, at regular intervals, four square, tolerablyvast cages, separated by narrow passages, built of masonry to about theheight of the elbow, and the rest, up to the roof, of iron bars.</p><p>Thénardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages sincethe night of the 3d of February. No one was ever able to discover how, andby what connivance, he succeeded in procuring, and secreting a bottle ofwine, invented, so it is said, by Desrues, with which a narcotic is mixed,and which the band of the <i>Endormeurs</i>, or <i>Sleep-compellers</i>, renderedfamous.</p><p>There are, in many prisons, treacherous employees, half-jailers,half-thieves, who assist in escapes, who sell to the police an unfaithfulservice, and who turn a penny whenever they can.</p><p>On that same night, then, when Little Gavroche picked up the two lostchildren, Brujon and Guelemer, who knew that Babet, who had escaped thatmorning, was waiting for them in the street as well as Montparnasse, rosesoftly, and with the nail which Brujon had found, began to pierce thechimney against which their beds stood. The rubbish fell on Brujon&rsquo;s bed,so that they were not heard. Showers mingled with thunder shook the doorson their hinges, and created in the prison a terrible and opportuneuproar. Those of the prisoners who woke, pretended to fall asleep again,and left Guelemer and Brujon to their own devices. Brujon was adroit;Guelemer was vigorous. Before any sound had reached the watcher, who wassleeping in the grated cell which opened into the dormitory, the wall hadbeen pierced, the chimney scaled, the iron grating which barred the upperorifice of the flue forced, and the two redoubtable ruffians were on theroof. The wind and rain redoubled, the roof was slippery.</p><p>&ldquo;What a good night to leg it!&rdquo; said Brujon.</p><p>An abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them from thesurrounding wall. At the bottom of this abyss, they could see the musketof a sentinel gleaming through the gloom. They fastened one end of therope which Brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the iron barswhich they had just wrenched off, flung the other over the outer wall,crossed the abyss at one bound, clung to the coping of the wall, gotastride of it, let themselves slip, one after the other, along the rope,upon a little roof which touches the bath-house, pulled their rope afterthem, jumped down into the courtyard of the bath-house, traversed it,pushed open the porter&rsquo;s wicket, beside which hung his rope, pulled this,opened the porte-cochère, and found themselves in the street.</p><p>Three-quarters of an hour had not elapsed since they had risen in bed inthe dark, nail in hand, and their project in their heads.</p><p>A few moments later they had joined Babet and Montparnasse, who wereprowling about the neighborhood.</p><p>They had broken their rope in pulling it after them, and a bit of itremained attached to the chimney on the roof. They had sustained no otherdamage, however, than that of scratching nearly all the skin off theirhands.</p><p>That night, Thénardier was warned, without any one being able to explainhow, and was not asleep.</p><p>Towards one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the night being very dark, he saw twoshadows pass along the roof, in the rain and squalls, in front of thedormer-window which was opposite his cage. One halted at the window, longenough to dart in a glance. This was Brujon.</p><p>Thénardier recognized him, and understood. This was enough.</p><p>Thénardier, rated as a burglar, and detained as a measure of precautionunder the charge of organizing a nocturnal ambush, with armed force, waskept in sight. The sentry, who was relieved every two hours, marched upand down in front of his cage with loaded musket. The Fine-Air was lightedby a skylight. The prisoner had on his feet fetters weighing fifty pounds.Every day, at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, a jailer, escorted by twodogs,&mdash;this was still in vogue at that time,&mdash;entered his cage,deposited beside his bed a loaf of black bread weighing two pounds, a jugof water, a bowl filled with rather thin bouillon, in which swam a fewMayagan beans, inspected his irons and tapped the bars. This man and hisdogs made two visits during the night.</p><p>Thénardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt which heused to spike his bread into a crack in the wall, &ldquo;in order to preserve itfrom the rats,&rdquo; as he said. As Thénardier was kept in sight, no objectionhad been made to this spike. Still, it was remembered afterwards, that oneof the jailers had said: &ldquo;It would be better to let him have only a woodenspike.&rdquo;</p><p>At two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the sentinel, who was an old soldier, wasrelieved, and replaced by a conscript. A few moments later, the man withthe dogs paid his visit, and went off without noticing anything, except,possibly, the excessive youth and &ldquo;the rustic air&rdquo; of the &ldquo;raw recruit.&rdquo; Two hours afterwards, at four o&rsquo;clock, when they came to relieve theconscript, he was found asleep on the floor, lying like a log nearThénardier&rsquo;s cage. As for Thénardier, he was no longer there. There was ahole in the ceiling of his cage, and, above it, another hole in the roof.One of the planks of his bed had been wrenched off, and probably carriedaway with him, as it was not found. They also seized in his cell ahalf-empty bottle which contained the remains of the stupefying wine withwhich the soldier had been drugged. The soldier&rsquo;s bayonet had disappeared.</p><p>At the moment when this discovery was made, it was assumed that Thénardierwas out of reach. The truth is, that he was no longer in the New Building,but that he was still in great danger.</p><p>Thénardier, on reaching the roof of the New Building, had found theremains of Brujon&rsquo;s rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap of thechimney, but, as this broken fragment was much too short, he had not beenable to escape by the outer wall, as Brujon and Guelemer had done.</p><p>When one turns from the Rue des Ballets into the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile, onealmost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin. There stood on that spot,in the last century, a house of which only the back wall now remains, aregular wall of masonry, which rises to the height of the third storybetween the adjoining buildings. This ruin can be recognized by two largesquare windows which are still to be seen there; the middle one, thatnearest the right gable, is barred with a worm-eaten beam adjusted like aprop. Through these windows there was formerly visible a lofty andlugubrious wall, which was a fragment of the outer wall of La Force.</p><p>The empty space on the street left by the demolished house is half-filledby a fence of rotten boards, shored up by five stone posts. In this recesslies concealed a little shanty which leans against the portion of the ruinwhich has remained standing. The fence has a gate, which, a few years ago,was fastened only by a latch.</p><p>It was the crest of this ruin that Thénardier had succeeded in reaching, alittle after one o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p><p>How had he got there? That is what no one has ever been able to explain orunderstand. The lightning must, at the same time, have hindered and helpedhim. Had he made use of the ladders and scaffoldings of the slaters to getfrom roof to roof, from enclosure to enclosure, from compartment tocompartment, to the buildings of the Charlemagne court, then to thebuildings of the Saint-Louis court, to the outer wall, and thence to thehut on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But in that itinerary there existedbreaks which seemed to render it an impossibility. Had he placed the plankfrom his bed like a bridge from the roof of the Fine-Air to the outerwall, and crawled flat, on his belly on the coping of the outer wall thewhole distance round the prison as far as the hut? But the outer wall ofLa Force formed a crenellated and unequal line; it mounted and descended,it dropped at the firemen&rsquo;s barracks, it rose towards the bath-house, itwas cut in twain by buildings, it was not even of the same height on theHotel Lamoignon as on the Rue Pavée; everywhere occurred falls and rightangles; and then, the sentinels must have espied the dark form of thefugitive; hence, the route taken by Thénardier still remains ratherinexplicable. In two manners, flight was impossible. Had Thénardier,spurred on by that thirst for liberty which changes precipices intoditches, iron bars into wattles of osier, a legless man into an athlete, agouty man into a bird, stupidity into instinct, instinct intointelligence, and intelligence into genius, had Thénardier invented athird mode? No one has ever found out.</p><p>The marvels of escape cannot always be accounted for. The man who makeshis escape, we repeat, is inspired; there is something of the star and ofthe lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight; the effort towardsdeliverance is no less surprising than the flight towards the sublime, andone says of the escaped thief: &ldquo;How did he contrive to scale that wall?&rdquo; in the same way that one says of Corneille: &ldquo;Where did he find <i>the meansof dying?</i>&rdquo;</p><p>At all events, dripping with perspiration, drenched with rain, with hisclothes hanging in ribbons, his hands flayed, his elbows bleeding, hisknees torn, Thénardier had reached what children, in their figurativelanguage, call <i>the edge</i> of the wall of the ruin, there he had stretchedhimself out at full length, and there his strength had failed him. A steepescarpment three stories high separated him from the pavement of thestreet.</p><p>The rope which he had was too short.</p><p>There he waited, pale, exhausted, desperate with all the despair which hehad undergone, still hidden by the night, but telling himself that the daywas on the point of dawning, alarmed at the idea of hearing theneighboring clock of Saint-Paul strike four within a few minutes, an hourwhen the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be found asleepunder the pierced roof, staring in horror at a terrible depth, at thelight of the street lanterns, the wet, black pavement, that pavementlonged for yet frightful, which meant death, and which meant liberty.</p><p>He asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded, ifthey had heard him, and if they would come to his assistance. He listened.With the exception of the patrol, no one had passed through the streetsince he had been there. Nearly the whole of the descent of themarket-gardeners from Montreuil, from Charonne, from Vincennes, and fromBercy to the markets was accomplished through the Rue Saint-Antoine.</p><p>Four o&rsquo;clock struck. Thénardier shuddered. A few moments later, thatterrified and confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escapebroke forth in the prison. The sound of doors opening and shutting, thecreaking of gratings on their hinges, a tumult in the guard-house, thehoarse shouts of the turnkeys, the shock of musket-butts on the pavementof the courts, reached his ears. Lights ascended and descended past thegrated windows of the dormitories, a torch ran along the ridge-pole of thetop story of the New Building, the firemen belonging in the barracks onthe right had been summoned. Their helmets, which the torch lighted up inthe rain, went and came along the roofs. At the same time, Thénardierperceived in the direction of the Bastille a wan whiteness lighting up theedge of the sky in doleful wise.</p><p>He was on top of a wall ten inches wide, stretched out under the heavyrains, with two gulfs to right and left, unable to stir, subject to thegiddiness of a possible fall, and to the horror of a certain arrest, andhis thoughts, like the pendulum of a clock, swung from one of these ideasto the other: &ldquo;Dead if I fall, caught if I stay.&rdquo; In the midst of thisanguish, he suddenly saw, the street being still dark, a man who wasgliding along the walls and coming from the Rue Pavée, halt in the recessabove which Thénardier was, as it were, suspended. Here this man wasjoined by a second, who walked with the same caution, then by a third,then by a fourth. When these men were re-united, one of them lifted thelatch of the gate in the fence, and all four entered the enclosure inwhich the shanty stood. They halted directly under Thénardier. These menhad evidently chosen this vacant space in order that they might consultwithout being seen by the passers-by or by the sentinel who guards thewicket of La Force a few paces distant. It must be added, that the rainkept this sentinel blocked in his box. Thénardier, not being able todistinguish their visages, lent an ear to their words with the desperateattention of a wretch who feels himself lost.</p><p>Thénardier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash before his eyes,&mdash;thesemen conversed in slang.</p><p>The first said in a low but distinct voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cut. What are we up to here?&rdquo;</p><p>The second replied: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining hard enough to put out the very devil&rsquo;sfire. And the bobbies will be along instanter. There&rsquo;s a soldier on guardyonder. We shall get nabbed here.&rdquo;</p><p>These two words, <i>icigo</i> and <i>icicaille</i>, both of which mean <i>ici</i>, and whichbelong, the first to the slang of the barriers, the second to the slang ofthe Temple, were flashes of light for Thénardier. By the <i>icigo</i> herecognized Brujon, who was a prowler of the barriers, by the <i>icicaille</i> heknew Babet, who, among his other trades, had been an old-clothes broker atthe Temple.</p><p>The antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except in theTemple, and Babet was really the only person who spoke it in all itspurity. Had it not been for the <i>icicaille</i>, Thénardier would not haverecognized him, for he had entirely changed his voice.</p><p>In the meanwhile, the third man had intervened.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hurry yet, let&rsquo;s wait a bit. How do we know that he doesn&rsquo;tstand in need of us?&rdquo;</p><p>By this, which was nothing but French, Thénardier recognized Montparnasse,who made it a point in his elegance to understand all slangs and to speaknone of them.</p><p>As for the fourth, he held his peace, but his huge shoulders betrayed him.Thénardier did not hesitate. It was Guelemer.</p><p>Brujon replied almost impetuously but still in a low tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you jabbering about? The tavern-keeper hasn&rsquo;t managed to cut hisstick. He don&rsquo;t tumble to the racket, that he don&rsquo;t! You have to be apretty knowing cove to tear up your shirt, cut up your sheet to make arope, punch holes in doors, get up false papers, make false keys, fileyour irons, hang out your cord, hide yourself, and disguise yourself! Theold fellow hasn&rsquo;t managed to play it, he doesn&rsquo;t understand how to workthe business.&rdquo;</p><p>Babet added, still in that classical slang which was spoken by Poulaillerand Cartouche, and which is to the bold, new, highly colored and riskyargot used by Brujon what the language of Racine is to the language ofAndré Chenier:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Your tavern-keeper must have been nabbed in the act. You have to beknowing. He&rsquo;s only a greenhorn. He must have let himself be taken in by abobby, perhaps even by a sheep who played it on him as his pal. Listen,Montparnasse, do you hear those shouts in the prison? You have seen allthose lights. He&rsquo;s recaptured, there! He&rsquo;ll get off with twenty years. Iain&rsquo;t afraid, I ain&rsquo;t a coward, but there ain&rsquo;t anything more to do, orotherwise they&rsquo;d lead us a dance. Don&rsquo;t get mad, come with us, let&rsquo;s godrink a bottle of old wine together.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t desert one&rsquo;s friends in a scrape,&rdquo; grumbled Montparnasse.</p><p>&ldquo;I tell you he&rsquo;s nabbed!&rdquo; retorted Brujon. &ldquo;At the present moment, theinn-keeper ain&rsquo;t worth a ha&rsquo;penny. We can&rsquo;t do nothing for him. Let&rsquo;s beoff. Every minute I think a bobby has got me in his fist.&rdquo;</p><p>Montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance; the fact is,that these four men, with the fidelity of ruffians who never abandon eachother, had prowled all night long about La Force, great as was theirperil, in the hope of seeing Thénardier make his appearance on the top ofsome wall. But the night, which was really growing too fine,&mdash;for thedownpour was such as to render all the streets deserted,&mdash;the coldwhich was overpowering them, their soaked garments, their hole-riddenshoes, the alarming noise which had just burst forth in the prison, thehours which had elapsed, the patrol which they had encountered, the hopewhich was vanishing, all urged them to beat a retreat. Montparnassehimself, who was, perhaps, almost Thénardier&rsquo;s son-in-law, yielded. Amoment more, and they would be gone. Thénardier was panting on his walllike the shipwrecked sufferers of the <i>Méduse</i> on their raft when theybeheld the vessel which had appeared in sight vanish on the horizon.</p><p>He dared not call to them; a cry might be heard and ruin everything. Anidea occurred to him, a last idea, a flash of inspiration; he drew fromhis pocket the end of Brujon&rsquo;s rope, which he had detached from thechimney of the New Building, and flung it into the space enclosed by thefence.</p><p>This rope fell at their feet.</p><p>&ldquo;A widow,&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-37" name="linknoteref-37" id="linknoteref-37">37</a>said Babet.</p><p>&ldquo;My tortouse!&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-38" name="linknoteref-38" id="linknoteref-38">38</a>said Brujon.</p><p>&ldquo;The tavern-keeper is there,&rdquo; said Montparnasse.</p><p>They raised their eyes. Thénardier thrust out his head a very little.</p><p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; said Montparnasse, &ldquo;have you the other end of the rope, Brujon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Knot the two pieces together, we&rsquo;ll fling him the rope, he can fasten itto the wall, and he&rsquo;ll have enough of it to get down with.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier ran the risk, and spoke:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am paralyzed with cold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll warm you up.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t budge.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let yourself slide, we&rsquo;ll catch you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My hands are benumbed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Only fasten the rope to the wall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then one of us must climb up,&rdquo; said Montparnasse.</p><p>&ldquo;Three stories!&rdquo; ejaculated Brujon.</p><p>An ancient plaster flue, which had served for a stove that had been usedin the shanty in former times, ran along the wall and mounted almost tothe very spot where they could see Thénardier. This flue, then muchdamaged and full of cracks, has since fallen, but the marks of it arestill visible.</p><p>It was very narrow.</p><p>&ldquo;One might get up by the help of that,&rdquo; said Montparnasse.</p><p>&ldquo;By that flue?&rdquo; exclaimed Babet, &ldquo;a grown-up cove, never! it would take abrat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A brat must be got,&rdquo; resumed Brujon.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are we to find a young &rsquo;un?&rdquo; said Guelemer.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Montparnasse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the very article.&rdquo;</p><p>He opened the gate of the fence very softly, made sure that no one waspassing along the street, stepped out cautiously, shut the gate behindhim, and set off at a run in the direction of the Bastille.</p><p>Seven or eight minutes elapsed, eight thousand centuries to Thénardier;Babet, Brujon, and Guelemer did not open their lips; at last the gateopened once more, and Montparnasse appeared, breathless, and followed byGavroche. The rain still rendered the street completely deserted.</p><p>Little Gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of theseruffians with a tranquil air. The water was dripping from his hair.Guelemer addressed him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you a man, young &rsquo;un?&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche shrugged his shoulders, and replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;A young &rsquo;un like me&rsquo;s a man, and men like you are babes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The brat&rsquo;s tongue&rsquo;s well hung!&rdquo; exclaimed Babet.</p><p>&ldquo;The Paris brat ain&rsquo;t made of straw,&rdquo; added Brujon.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked Gavroche.</p><p>Montparnasse answered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Climb up that flue.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With this rope,&rdquo; said Babet.</p><p>&ldquo;And fasten it,&rdquo; continued Brujon.</p><p>&ldquo;To the top of the wall,&rdquo; went on Babet.</p><p>&ldquo;To the cross-bar of the window,&rdquo; added Brujon.</p><p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Guelemer.</p><p>The gamin examined the rope, the flue, the wall, the windows, and madethat indescribable and disdainful noise with his lips which signifies:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that all!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man up there whom you are to save,&rdquo; resumed Montparnasse.</p><p>&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; began Brujon again.</p><p>&ldquo;Greenhorn!&rdquo; replied the lad, as though the question appeared a mostunprecedented one to him.</p><p>And he took off his shoes.</p><p>Guelemer seized Gavroche by one arm, set him on the roof of the shanty,whose worm-eaten planks bent beneath the urchin&rsquo;s weight, and handed himthe rope which Brujon had knotted together during Montparnasse&rsquo;s absence.The gamin directed his steps towards the flue, which it was easy to enter,thanks to a large crack which touched the roof. At the moment when he wason the point of ascending, Thénardier, who saw life and safetyapproaching, bent over the edge of the wall; the first light of dawnstruck white upon his brow dripping with sweat, upon his lividcheek-bones, his sharp and savage nose, his bristling gray beard, andGavroche recognized him.</p><p>&ldquo;Hullo! it&rsquo;s my father! Oh, that won&rsquo;t hinder.&rdquo;</p><p>And taking the rope in his teeth, he resolutely began the ascent.</p><p>He reached the summit of the hut, bestrode the old wall as though it hadbeen a horse, and knotted the rope firmly to the upper cross-bar of thewindow.</p><p>A moment later, Thénardier was in the street.</p><p>As soon as he touched the pavement, as soon as he found himself out ofdanger, he was no longer either weary, or chilled or trembling; theterrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke, all thatstrange and ferocious mind awoke once more, and stood erect and free,ready to march onward.</p><p>These were this man&rsquo;s first words:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Now, whom are we to eat?&rdquo;</p><p>It is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent remark,which signifies both to kill, to assassinate, and to plunder. <i>To eat</i>, truesense: <i>to devour</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get well into a corner,&rdquo; said Brujon. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s settle it in threewords, and part at once. There was an affair that promised well in the RuePlumet, a deserted street, an isolated house, an old rotten gate on agarden, and lone women.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well! why not?&rdquo; demanded Thénardier.</p><p>&ldquo;Your girl, Éponine, went to see about the matter,&rdquo; replied Babet.</p><p>&ldquo;And she brought a biscuit to Magnon,&rdquo; added Guelemer. &ldquo;Nothing to be madethere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s no fool,&rdquo; said Thénardier. &ldquo;Still, it must be seen to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Brujon, &ldquo;it must be looked up.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meanwhile, none of the men seemed to see Gavroche, who, during thiscolloquy, had seated himself on one of the fence-posts; he waited a fewmoments, thinking that perhaps his father would turn towards him, then heput on his shoes again, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is that all? You don&rsquo;t want any more, my men? Now you&rsquo;re out of yourscrape. I&rsquo;m off. I must go and get my brats out of bed.&rdquo;</p><p>And off he went.</p><p>The five men emerged, one after another, from the enclosure.</p><p>When Gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the Rue des Ballets, Babettook Thénardier aside.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you take a good look at that young &rsquo;un?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;What young &rsquo;un?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The one who climbed the wall and carried you the rope.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not particularly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know, but it strikes me that it was your son.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Thénardier, &ldquo;do you think so?&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0290" id="link2H_4_0290"></a>BOOK SEVENTH&mdash;SLANG</h3><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0035" id="linkimage-0035"></a><img src="images/4b7-1-slang.jpg" alt="Slang" width="100%" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0252" id="link2HCH0252"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;ORIGIN</h3><p><i>Pigritia</i> is a terrible word.</p><p>It engenders a whole world, <i>la pègre</i>, for which read <i>theft</i>, and a hell, <i>lapègrenne</i>, for which read <i>hunger</i>.</p><p>Thus, idleness is the mother.</p><p>She has a son, theft, and a daughter, hunger.</p><p>Where are we at this moment? In the land of slang.</p><p>What is slang? It is at one and the same time, a nation and a dialect; itis theft in its two kinds; people and language.</p><p>When, four and thirty years ago, the narrator of this grave and sombrehistory introduced into a work written with the same aim as this<ahref="#linknote-39" name="linknoteref-39" id="linknoteref-39">39</a> athief who talked argot, there arose amazement and clamor.&mdash;&ldquo;What!How! Argot! Why, argot is horrible! It is the language of prisons,galleys, convicts, of everything that is most abominable in society!&rdquo; etc., etc.</p><p>We have never understood this sort of objections.</p><p>Since that time, two powerful romancers, one of whom is a profoundobserver of the human heart, the other an intrepid friend of the people,Balzac and Eugène Sue, having represented their ruffians as talking theirnatural language, as the author of <i>The Last Day of a Condemned Man</i> did in1828, the same objections have been raised. People repeated: &ldquo;What doauthors mean by that revolting dialect? Slang is odious! Slang makes oneshudder!&rdquo;</p><p>Who denies that? Of course it does.</p><p>When it is a question of probing a wound, a gulf, a society, since whenhas it been considered wrong to go too far? to go to the bottom? We havealways thought that it was sometimes a courageous act, and, at least, asimple and useful deed, worthy of the sympathetic attention which dutyaccepted and fulfilled merits. Why should one not explore everything, andstudy everything? Why should one halt on the way? The halt is a matterdepending on the sounding-line, and not on the leadsman.</p><p>Certainly, too, it is neither an attractive nor an easy task to undertakean investigation into the lowest depths of the social order, where terrafirma comes to an end and where mud begins, to rummage in those vague,murky waves, to follow up, to seize and to fling, still quivering, uponthe pavement that abject dialect which is dripping with filth when thusbrought to the light, that pustulous vocabulary each word of which seemsan unclean ring from a monster of the mire and the shadows. Nothing ismore lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity, in the broadlight of thought, of the horrible swarming of slang. It seems, in fact, tobe a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has just been tornfrom its cesspool. One thinks one beholds a frightful, living, andbristling thicket which quivers, rustles, wavers, returns to shadow,threatens and glares. One word resembles a claw, another an extinguishedand bleeding eye, such and such a phrase seems to move like the claw of acrab. All this is alive with the hideous vitality of things which havebeen organized out of disorganization.</p><p>Now, when has horror ever excluded study? Since when has malady banishedmedicine? Can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper, thebat, the scorpion, the centipede, the tarantula, and one who would castthem back into their darkness, saying: &ldquo;Oh! how ugly that is!&rdquo; The thinkerwho should turn aside from slang would resemble a surgeon who should averthis face from an ulcer or a wart. He would be like a philologist refusingto examine a fact in language, a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize afact in humanity. For, it must be stated to those who are ignorant of thecase, that argot is both a literary phenomenon and a social result. Whatis slang, properly speaking? It is the language of wretchedness.</p><p>We may be stopped; the fact may be put to us in general terms, which isone way of attenuating it; we may be told, that all trades, professions,it may be added, all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all formsof intelligence, have their own slang. The merchant who says: &ldquo;Montpelliernot active, Marseilles fine quality,&rdquo; the broker on &rsquo;change who says:&ldquo;Assets at end of current month,&rdquo; the gambler who says: <i>&ldquo;Tiers et tout,refait de pique,&rdquo;</i> the sheriff of the Norman Isles who says: &ldquo;The holder infee reverting to his landed estate cannot claim the fruits of that estateduring the hereditary seizure of the real estate by the mortgagor,&rdquo; theplaywright who says: &ldquo;The piece was hissed,&rdquo; the comedian who says: &ldquo;I&rsquo;vemade a hit,&rdquo; the philosopher who says: &ldquo;Phenomenal triplicity,&rdquo; thehuntsman who says: <i>&ldquo;Voileci allais, Voileci fuyant,&rdquo;</i> the phrenologist whosays: &ldquo;Amativeness, combativeness, secretiveness,&rdquo; the infantry soldierwho says: &ldquo;My shooting-iron,&rdquo; the cavalry-man who says: &ldquo;My turkey-cock,&rdquo; the fencing-master who says: &ldquo;Tierce, quarte, break,&rdquo; the printer whosays: &ldquo;My shooting-stick and galley,&rdquo;&mdash;all, printer, fencing-master,cavalry dragoon, infantry-man, phrenologist, huntsman, philosopher,comedian, playwright, sheriff, gambler, stock-broker, and merchant, speakslang. The painter who says: &ldquo;My grinder,&rdquo; the notary who says: &ldquo;MySkip-the-Gutter,&rdquo; the hairdresser who says: &ldquo;My mealyback,&rdquo; the cobblerwho says: &ldquo;My cub,&rdquo; talks slang. Strictly speaking, if one absolutelyinsists on the point, all the different fashions of saying the right andthe left, the sailor&rsquo;s <i>port</i> and <i>starboard</i>, the scene-shifter&rsquo;s <i>court-side</i>,and <i>garden-side</i>, the beadle&rsquo;s <i>Gospel-side</i> and <i>Epistle-side</i>, are slang.There is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the <i>précieuses</i>. TheHotel Rambouillet nearly adjoins the Cour des Miracles. There is a slangof duchesses, witness this phrase contained in a love-letter from a verygreat lady and a very pretty woman of the Restoration: &ldquo;You will find inthis gossip a fultitude of reasons why I should libertize.&rdquo;<ahref="#linknote-40" name="linknoteref-40" id="linknoteref-40">40</a>Diplomatic ciphers are slang; the pontifical chancellery by using 26 forRome, <i>grkztntgzyal</i> for despatch, and <i>abfxustgrnogrkzu tu XI</i>. for the Ducde Modena, speaks slang. The physicians of the Middle Ages who, forcarrot, radish, and turnip, said <i>Opoponach, perfroschinum, reptitalmus,dracatholicum, angelorum, postmegorum</i>, talked slang. Thesugar-manufacturer who says: &ldquo;Loaf, clarified, lumps, bastard, common,burnt,&rdquo;&mdash;this honest manufacturer talks slang. A certain school ofcriticism twenty years ago, which used to say: &ldquo;Half of the works ofShakespeare consists of plays upon words and puns,&rdquo;&mdash;talked slang.The poet, and the artist who, with profound understanding, would designateM. de Montmorency as &ldquo;a bourgeois,&rdquo; if he were not a judge of verses andstatues, speak slang. The classic Academician who calls flowers &ldquo;Flora,&rdquo; fruits, &ldquo;Pomona,&rdquo; the sea, &ldquo;Neptune,&rdquo; love, &ldquo;fires,&rdquo; beauty, &ldquo;charms,&rdquo; ahorse, &ldquo;a courser,&rdquo; the white or tricolored cockade, &ldquo;the rose ofBellona,&rdquo; the three-cornered hat, &ldquo;Mars&rsquo; triangle,&rdquo;&mdash;that classicalAcademician talks slang. Algebra, medicine, botany, have each their slang.The tongue which is employed on board ship, that wonderful language of thesea, which is so complete and so picturesque, which was spoken by JeanBart, Duquesne, Suffren, and Duperré, which mingles with the whistling ofthe rigging, the sound of the speaking-trumpets, the shock of theboarding-irons, the roll of the sea, the wind, the gale, the cannon, iswholly a heroic and dazzling slang, which is to the fierce slang of thethieves what the lion is to the jackal.</p><p>No doubt. But say what we will, this manner of understanding the word<i>slang</i> is an extension which every one will not admit. For our part, wereserve to the word its ancient and precise, circumscribed and determinedsignificance, and we restrict slang to slang. The veritable slang and theslang that is pre-eminently slang, if the two words can be coupled thus,the slang immemorial which was a kingdom, is nothing else, we repeat, thanthe homely, uneasy, crafty, treacherous, venomous, cruel, equivocal, vile,profound, fatal tongue of wretchedness. There exists, at the extremity ofall abasement and all misfortunes, a last misery which revolts and makesup its mind to enter into conflict with the whole mass of fortunate factsand reigning rights; a fearful conflict, where, now cunning, now violent,unhealthy and ferocious at one and the same time, it attacks the socialorder with pin-pricks through vice, and with club-blows through crime. Tomeet the needs of this conflict, wretchedness has invented a language ofcombat, which is slang.</p><p>To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf, wereit but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would,otherwise, be lost, that is to say, one of the elements, good or bad, ofwhich civilization is composed, or by which it is complicated, to extendthe records of social observation; is to serve civilization itself. Thisservice Plautus rendered, consciously or unconsciously, by making twoCarthaginian soldiers talk Phœnician; that service Molière rendered, bymaking so many of his characters talk Levantine and all sorts of dialects.Here objections spring up afresh. Phœnician, very good! Levantine, quiteright! Even dialect, let that pass! They are tongues which have belongedto nations or provinces; but slang! What is the use of preserving slang?What is the good of assisting slang &ldquo;to survive&rdquo;?</p><p>To this we reply in one word, only. Assuredly, if the tongue which anation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest, the language whichhas been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study.</p><p>It is the language which has been spoken, in France, for example, for morethan four centuries, not only by a misery, but by every possible humanmisery.</p><p>And then, we insist upon it, the study of social deformities andinfirmities, and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy, isnot a business in which choice is permitted. The historian of manners andideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events. Thelatter has the surface of civilization, the conflicts of crowns, thebirths of princes, the marriages of kings, battles, assemblages, greatpublic men, revolutions in the daylight, everything on the exterior; theother historian has the interior, the depths, the people who toil, suffer,wait, the oppressed woman, the agonizing child, the secret war between manand man, obscure ferocities, prejudices, plotted iniquities, thesubterranean, the indistinct tremors of multitudes, the die-of-hunger, thecounter-blows of the law, the secret evolution of souls, the go-bare-foot,the bare-armed, the disinherited, the orphans, the unhappy, and theinfamous, all the forms which roam through the darkness. He must descendwith his heart full of charity, and severity at the same time, as abrother and as a judge, to those impenetrable casemates where crawl,pell-mell, those who bleed and those who deal the blow, those who weep andthose who curse, those who fast and those who devour, those who endureevil and those who inflict it. Have these historians of hearts and soulsduties at all inferior to the historians of external facts? Does any onethink that Alighieri has any fewer things to say than Machiavelli? Is theunder side of civilization any less important than the upper side merelybecause it is deeper and more sombre? Do we really know the mountain wellwhen we are not acquainted with the cavern?</p><p>Let us say, moreover, parenthetically, that from a few words of whatprecedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes ofhistorians which does not exist in our mind. No one is a good historian ofthe patent, visible, striking, and public life of peoples, if he is not,at the same time, in a certain measure, the historian of their deep andhidden life; and no one is a good historian of the interior unless heunderstands how, at need, to be the historian of the exterior also. Thehistory of manners and ideas permeates the history of events, and this istrue reciprocally. They constitute two different orders of facts whichcorrespond to each other, which are always interlaced, and which oftenbring forth results. All the lineaments which providence traces on thesurface of a nation have their parallels, sombre but distinct, in theirdepths, and all convulsions of the depths produce ebullitions on thesurface. True history being a mixture of all things, the true historianmingles in everything.</p><p>Man is not a circle with a single centre; he is an ellipse with a doublefocus. Facts form one of these, and ideas the other.</p><p>Slang is nothing but a dressing-room where the tongue having some badaction to perform, disguises itself. There it clothes itself inword-masks, in metaphor-rags. In this guise it becomes horrible.</p><p>One finds it difficult to recognize. Is it really the French tongue, thegreat human tongue? Behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retortupon crime, and prepared for all the employments of the repertory of evil.It no longer walks, it hobbles; it limps on the crutch of the Court ofMiracles, a crutch metamorphosable into a club; it is called vagrancy;every sort of spectre, its dressers, have painted its face, it crawls andrears, the double gait of the reptile. Henceforth, it is apt at all rôles,it is made suspicious by the counterfeiter, covered with verdigris by theforger, blacked by the soot of the incendiary; and the murderer appliesits rouge.</p><p>When one listens, by the side of honest men, at the portals of society,one overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside. Onedistinguishes questions and replies. One perceives, without understandingit, a hideous murmur, sounding almost like human accents, but more nearlyresembling a howl than an articulate word. It is slang. The words aremisshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantastic bestiality. Onethinks one hears hydras talking.</p><p>It is unintelligible in the dark. It gnashes and whispers, completing thegloom with mystery. It is black in misfortune, it is blacker still incrime; these two blacknesses amalgamated, compose slang. Obscurity in theatmosphere, obscurity in acts, obscurity in voices. Terrible, toad-liketongue which goes and comes, leaps, crawls, slobbers, and stirs about inmonstrous wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain and night, ofhunger, of vice, of falsehood, of injustice, of nudity, of suffocation,and of winter, the high noonday of the miserable.</p><p>Let us have compassion on the chastised. Alas! Who are we ourselves? Whoam I who now address you? Who are you who are listening to me? And are youvery sure that we have done nothing before we were born? The earth is notdevoid of resemblance to a jail. Who knows whether man is not a recapturedoffender against divine justice? Look closely at life. It is so made, thateverywhere we feel the sense of punishment.</p><p>Are you what is called a happy man? Well! you are sad every day. Each dayhas its own great grief or its little care. Yesterday you were tremblingfor a health that is dear to you, to-day you fear for your own; to-morrowit will be anxiety about money, the day after to-morrow the diatribe of aslanderer, the day after that, the misfortune of some friend; then theprevailing weather, then something that has been broken or lost, then apleasure with which your conscience and your vertebral column reproachyou; again, the course of public affairs. This without reckoning in thepains of the heart. And so it goes on. One cloud is dispelled, anotherforms. There is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous andsunny. And you belong to that small class who are happy! As for the restof mankind, stagnating night rests upon them.</p><p>Thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase: the fortunate and theunfortunate. In this world, evidently the vestibule of another, there areno fortunate.</p><p>The real human division is this: the luminous and the shady. To diminishthe number of the shady, to augment the number of the luminous,&mdash;thatis the object. That is why we cry: Education! science! To teach reading,means to light the fire; every syllable spelled out sparkles.</p><p>However, he who says light does not, necessarily, say joy. People sufferin the light; excess burns. The flame is the enemy of the wing. To burnwithout ceasing to fly,&mdash;therein lies the marvel of genius.</p><p>When you shall have learned to know, and to love, you will still suffer.The day is born in tears. The luminous weep, if only over those indarkness.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0253" id="link2HCH0253"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;ROOTS</h3><p>Slang is the tongue of those who sit in darkness.</p><p>Thought is moved in its most sombre depths, social philosophy is bidden toits most poignant meditations, in the presence of that enigmatic dialectat once so blighted and rebellious. Therein lies chastisement madevisible. Every syllable has an air of being marked. The words of thevulgar tongue appear therein wrinkled and shrivelled, as it were, beneaththe hot iron of the executioner. Some seem to be still smoking. Such andsuch a phrase produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of a thiefbranded with the fleur-de-lys, which has suddenly been laid bare. Ideasalmost refuse to be expressed in these substantives which are fugitivesfrom justice. Metaphor is sometimes so shameless, that one feels that ithas worn the iron neck-fetter.</p><p>Moreover, in spite of all this, and because of all this, this strangedialect has by rights, its own compartment in that great impartial case ofpigeon-holes where there is room for the rusty farthing as well as for thegold medal, and which is called literature. Slang, whether the publicadmit the fact or not has its syntax and its poetry. It is a language.Yes, by the deformity of certain terms, we recognize the fact that it waschewed by Mandrin, and by the splendor of certain metonymies, we feel thatVillon spoke it.</p><p>That exquisite and celebrated verse&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Mais où sont les neiges d&rsquo;antan?<br/><br/>But where are the snows of years gone by?</p><p>is a verse of slang. <i>Antan&mdash;ante annum</i>&mdash;is a word of Thunesslang, which signified the past year, and by extension, <i>formerly</i>.Thirty-five years ago, at the epoch of the departure of the greatchain-gang, there could be read in one of the cells at Bicêtre, this maximengraved with a nail on the wall by a king of Thunes condemned to thegalleys: <i>Les dabs d&rsquo;antan trimaient siempre pour la pierre du Coësre</i>. Thismeans <i>Kings in days gone by always went and had themselves anointed</i>. Inthe opinion of that king, anointment meant the galleys.</p><p>The word <i>décarade</i>, which expresses the departure of heavy vehicles at agallop, is attributed to Villon, and it is worthy of him. This word, whichstrikes fire with all four of its feet, sums up in a masterly onomatopœiathe whole of La Fontaine&rsquo;s admirable verse:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Six forts chevaux tiraient un coche.<br/><br/>Six stout horses drew a coach.</p><p>From a purely literary point of view, few studies would prove more curiousand fruitful than the study of slang. It is a whole language within alanguage, a sort of sickly excrescence, an unhealthy graft which hasproduced a vegetation, a parasite which has its roots in the old Gallictrunk, and whose sinister foliage crawls all over one side of thelanguage. This is what may be called the first, the vulgar aspect ofslang. But, for those who study the tongue as it should be studied, thatis to say, as geologists study the earth, slang appears like a veritablealluvial deposit. According as one digs a longer or shorter distance intoit, one finds in slang, below the old popular French, Provençal, Spanish,Italian, Levantine, that language of the Mediterranean ports, English andGerman, the Romance language in its three varieties, French, Italian, andRomance Romance, Latin, and finally Basque and Celtic. A profound andunique formation. A subterranean edifice erected in common by all themiserable. Each accursed race has deposited its layer, each suffering hasdropped its stone there, each heart has contributed its pebble. A throngof evil, base, or irritated souls, who have traversed life and havevanished into eternity, linger there almost entirely visible still beneaththe form of some monstrous word.</p><p>Do you want Spanish? The old Gothic slang abounded in it. Here is <i>boffete</i>,a box on the ear, which is derived from <i>bofeton; vantane</i>, window (later on<i>vanterne</i>), which comes from <i>vantana; gat</i>, cat, which comes from <i>gato;acite</i>, oil, which comes from <i>aceyte</i>. Do you want Italian? Here is <i>spade</i>,sword, which comes from <i>spada; carvel</i>, boat, which comes from <i>caravella</i>.Do you want English? Here is <i>bichot</i>, which comes from <i>bishop; raille</i>, spy,which comes from <i>rascal, rascalion; pilche</i>, a case, which comes from<i>pilcher</i>, a sheath. Do you want German? Here is the <i>caleur</i>, the waiter,<i>kellner</i>; the <i>hers</i>, the master, <i>herzog</i> (duke). Do you want Latin? Here is<i>frangir</i>, to break, <i>frangere; affurer</i>, to steal, <i>fur; cadene</i>, chain,<i>catena</i>. There is one word which crops up in every language of thecontinent, with a sort of mysterious power and authority. It is the word<i>magnus</i>; the Scotchman makes of it his <i>mac</i>, which designates the chief ofthe clan; Mac-Farlane, Mac-Callumore, the great Farlane, the greatCallumore<a href="#linknote-41" name="linknoteref-41" id="linknoteref-41">41</a>;slang turns it into <i>meck</i> and later <i>le meg</i>, that is to say, God. Would youlike Basque? Here is <i>gahisto</i>, the devil, which comes from <i>gaïztoa</i>, evil;<i>sorgabon</i>, good night, which comes from <i>gabon</i>, good evening. Do you wantCeltic? Here is <i>blavin</i>, a handkerchief, which comes from <i>blavet</i>, gushingwater; <i>ménesse</i>, a woman (in a bad sense), which comes from <i>meinec</i>, full ofstones; <i>barant</i>, brook, from <i>baranton</i>, fountain; <i>goffeur</i>, locksmith, from<i>goff</i>, blacksmith; <i>guedouze</i>, death, which comes from <i>guenn-du</i>, black-white.Finally, would you like history? Slang calls crowns <i>les maltèses</i>, asouvenir of the coin in circulation on the galleys of Malta.</p><p>In addition to the philological origins just indicated, slang possessesother and still more natural roots, which spring, so to speak, from themind of man itself.</p><p>In the first place, the direct creation of words. Therein lies the mysteryof tongues. To paint with words, which contains figures one knows not howor why, is the primitive foundation of all human languages, what may becalled their granite.</p><p>Slang abounds in words of this description, immediate words, words createdinstantaneously no one knows either where or by whom, without etymology,without analogies, without derivatives, solitary, barbarous, sometimeshideous words, which at times possess a singular power of expression andwhich live. The executioner, <i>le taule</i>; the forest, <i>le sabri</i>; fear, flight,<i>taf</i>; the lackey, <i>le larbin</i>; the mineral, the prefect, the minister,<i>pharos</i>; the devil, <i>le rabouin</i>. Nothing is stranger than these words whichboth mask and reveal. Some, <i>le rabouin</i>, for example, are at the same timegrotesque and terrible, and produce on you the effect of a cyclopeangrimace.</p><p>In the second place, metaphor. The peculiarity of a language which isdesirous of saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich in figures.Metaphor is an enigma, wherein the thief who is plotting a stroke, theprisoner who is arranging an escape, take refuge. No idiom is moremetaphorical than slang: <i>dévisser le coco</i> (to unscrew the nut), to twistthe neck; <i>tortiller</i> (to wriggle), to eat; <i>être gerbé</i>, to be tried; <i>a rat</i>,a bread thief; <i>il lansquine</i>, it rains, a striking, ancient figure whichpartly bears its date about it, which assimilates long oblique lines ofrain, with the dense and slanting pikes of the lancers, and whichcompresses into a single word the popular expression: it rains halberds.Sometimes, in proportion as slang progresses from the first epoch to thesecond, words pass from the primitive and savage sense to the metaphoricalsense. The devil ceases to be <i>le rabouin</i>, and becomes <i>le boulanger</i> (thebaker), who puts the bread into the oven. This is more witty, but lessgrand, something like Racine after Corneille, like Euripides afterÆschylus. Certain slang phrases which participate in the two epochs andhave at once the barbaric character and the metaphorical characterresemble phantasmagories. <i>Les sorgueuers vont solliciter des gails à lalune</i>&mdash;the prowlers are going to steal horses by night,&mdash;thispasses before the mind like a group of spectres. One knows not what onesees.</p><p>In the third place, the expedient. Slang lives on the language. It uses itin accordance with its fancy, it dips into it hap-hazard, and it oftenconfines itself, when occasion arises, to alter it in a gross and summaryfashion. Occasionally, with the ordinary words thus deformed andcomplicated with words of pure slang, picturesque phrases are formed, inwhich there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding elements, thedirect creation and the metaphor: <i>le cab jaspine, je marronne que laroulotte de Pantin trime dans le sabri</i>, the dog is barking, I suspect thatthe diligence for Paris is passing through the woods. <i>Le dab est sinve, ladabuge est merloussière, la fée est bative</i>, the bourgeois is stupid, thebourgeoise is cunning, the daughter is pretty. Generally, to throwlisteners off the track, slang confines itself to adding to all the wordsof the language without distinction, an ignoble tail, a termination in<i>aille</i>, in <i>orgue</i>, in <i>iergue</i>, or in <i>uche</i>. Thus: <i>Vousiergue trouvaillebonorgue ce gigotmuche?</i> Do you think that leg of mutton good? A phraseaddressed by Cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out whether the sumoffered for his escape suited him.</p><p>The termination in <i>mar</i> has been added recently.</p><p>Slang, being the dialect of corruption, quickly becomes corrupted itself.Besides this, as it is always seeking concealment, as soon as it feelsthat it is understood, it changes its form. Contrary to what happens withevery other vegetation, every ray of light which falls upon it killswhatever it touches. Thus slang is in constant process of decompositionand recomposition; an obscure and rapid work which never pauses. It passesover more ground in ten years than a language in ten centuries. Thus <i>lelarton</i> (bread) becomes <i>le lartif; le gail</i> (horse) becomes <i>le gaye; lafertanche</i> (straw) becomes <i>la fertille; le momignard</i> (brat), <i>le momacque;les fiques</i> (duds), <i>frusques; la chique</i> (the church), <i>l&rsquo;égrugeoir; lecolabre</i> (neck), <i>le colas</i>. The devil is at first, <i>gahisto</i>, then <i>le rabouin</i>,then <i>the baker</i>; the priest is a <i>ratichon</i>, then the boar (<i>le sanglier</i>); thedagger is <i>le vingt-deux</i> (twenty-two), then <i>le surin</i>, then <i>le lingre</i>; thepolice are <i>railles</i>, then <i>roussins</i>, then <i>rousses</i>, then <i>marchands de lacets</i>(dealers in stay-laces), then <i>coquers</i>, then <i>cognes</i>; the executioner is <i>letaule</i>, then <i>Charlot, l&rsquo;atigeur</i>, then <i>le becquillard</i>. In the seventeenthcentury, to fight was &ldquo;to give each other snuff&rdquo;; in the nineteenth it is&ldquo;to chew each other&rsquo;s throats.&rdquo; There have been twenty different phrasesbetween these two extremes. Cartouche&rsquo;s talk would have been Hebrew toLacenaire. All the words of this language are perpetually engaged inflight like the men who utter them.</p><p>Still, from time to time, and in consequence of this very movement, theancient slang crops up again and becomes new once more. It has itsheadquarters where it maintains its sway. The Temple preserved the slangof the seventeenth century; Bicêtre, when it was a prison, preserved theslang of Thunes. There one could hear the termination in <i>anche</i> of the oldThuneurs. <i>Boyanches-tu</i> (bois-tu), do you drink? But perpetual movementremains its law, nevertheless.</p><p>If the philosopher succeeds in fixing, for a moment, for purposes ofobservation, this language which is incessantly evaporating, he falls intodoleful and useful meditation. No study is more efficacious and morefecund in instruction. There is not a metaphor, not an analogy, in slang,which does not contain a lesson. Among these men, to beat means to feign;one beats a malady; ruse is their strength.</p><p>For them, the idea of the man is not separated from the idea of darkness.The night is called <i>la sorgue</i>; man, <i>l&rsquo;orgue</i>. Man is a derivative of thenight.</p><p>They have taken up the practice of considering society in the light of anatmosphere which kills them, of a fatal force, and they speak of theirliberty as one would speak of his health. A man under arrest is a <i>sickman</i>; one who is condemned is a <i>dead man</i>.</p><p>The most terrible thing for the prisoner within the four walls in which heis buried, is a sort of glacial chastity, and he calls the dungeon the<i>castus</i>. In that funereal place, life outside always presents itself underits most smiling aspect. The prisoner has irons on his feet; you think,perhaps, that his thought is that it is with the feet that one walks? No;he is thinking that it is with the feet that one dances; so, when he hassucceeded in severing his fetters, his first idea is that now he candance, and he calls the saw the <i>bastringue</i> (public-house ball).&mdash;Aname is a centre; profound assimilation.&mdash;The ruffian has two heads,one of which reasons out his actions and leads him all his life long, andthe other which he has upon his shoulders on the day of his death; hecalls the head which counsels him in crime <i>la sorbonne</i>, and the head whichexpiates it <i>la tronche</i>.&mdash;When a man has no longer anything but ragsupon his body and vices in his heart, when he has arrived at that doublemoral and material degradation which the word blackguard characterizes inits two acceptations, he is ripe for crime; he is like a well-whettedknife; he has two cutting edges, his distress and his malice; so slangdoes not say a blackguard, it says <i>un réguisé</i>.&mdash;What are the galleys?A brazier of damnation, a hell. The convict calls himself a <i>fagot</i>.&mdash;Andfinally, what name do malefactors give to their prison? The <i>college</i>. Awhole penitentiary system can be evolved from that word.</p><p>Does the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of thegalleys, those refrains called in the special vocabulary <i>lirlonfa</i>, havehad their birth?</p><p>Let him listen to what follows:&mdash;</p><p>There existed at the Châtelet in Paris a large and long cellar. Thiscellar was eight feet below the level of the Seine. It had neither windowsnor air-holes, its only aperture was the door; men could enter there, aircould not. This vault had for ceiling a vault of stone, and for floor teninches of mud. It was flagged; but the pavement had rotted and crackedunder the oozing of the water. Eight feet above the floor, a long andmassive beam traversed this subterranean excavation from side to side;from this beam hung, at short distances apart, chains three feet long, andat the end of these chains there were rings for the neck. In this vault,men who had been condemned to the galleys were incarcerated until the dayof their departure for Toulon. They were thrust under this beam, whereeach one found his fetters swinging in the darkness and waiting for him.</p><p>The chains, those pendant arms, and the necklets, those open hands, caughtthe unhappy wretches by the throat. They were rivetted and left there. Asthe chain was too short, they could not lie down. They remained motionlessin that cavern, in that night, beneath that beam, almost hanging, forcedto unheard-of efforts to reach their bread, jug, or their vault overhead,mud even to mid-leg, filth flowing to their very calves, broken asunderwith fatigue, with thighs and knees giving way, clinging fast to the chainwith their hands in order to obtain some rest, unable to sleep except whenstanding erect, and awakened every moment by the strangling of the collar;some woke no more. In order to eat, they pushed the bread, which was flungto them in the mud, along their leg with their heel until it reached theirhand.</p><p>How long did they remain thus? One month, two months, six monthssometimes; one stayed a year. It was the antechamber of the galleys. Menwere put there for stealing a hare from the king. In this sepulchre-hell,what did they do? What man can do in a sepulchre, they went through theagonies of death, and what can man do in hell, they sang; for song lingerswhere there is no longer any hope. In the waters of Malta, when a galleywas approaching, the song could be heard before the sound of the oars.Poor Survincent, the poacher, who had gone through the prison-cellar ofthe Châtelet, said: &ldquo;It was the rhymes that kept me up.&rdquo; Uselessness ofpoetry. What is the good of rhyme?</p><p>It is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had their birth. Itis from the dungeon of the Grand-Châtelet of Paris that comes themelancholy refrain of the Montgomery galley: <i>&ldquo;Timaloumisaine,timaloumison.&rdquo;</i> The majority of these songs are melancholy;some are gay; one is tender:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Icicaille est la theatre<br/>Du petit dardant.<br/><br/>Here is the theatre<br/>Of the little archer (Cupid).</p><p>Do what you will, you cannot annihilate that eternal relic in the heart ofman, love.</p><p>In this world of dismal deeds, people keep their secrets. The secret isthe thing above all others. The secret, in the eyes of these wretches, isunity which serves as a base of union. To betray a secret is to tear fromeach member of this fierce community something of his own personality. Toinform against, in the energetic slang dialect, is called: &ldquo;to eat thebit.&rdquo; As though the informer drew to himself a little of the substance ofall and nourished himself on a bit of each one&rsquo;s flesh.</p><p>What does it signify to receive a box on the ear? Commonplace metaphor replies:&ldquo;It is to see thirty-six candles.&rdquo; Here slang intervenes and takesit up: Candle, <i>camoufle</i>. Thereupon, the ordinary tongue gives<i>camouflet</i><a href="#linknote-42" name="linknoteref-42" id="linknoteref-42">42</a>as the synonym for <i>soufflet</i>. Thus, by a sort of infiltration from belowupwards, with the aid of metaphor, that incalculable, trajectory slang mountsfrom the cavern to the Academy; and Poulailler saying: &ldquo;I light my<i>camoufle</i>,&rdquo; causes Voltaire to write: &ldquo;Langleviel LaBeaumelle deserves a hundred <i>camouflets</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>Researches in slang mean discoveries at every step. Study andinvestigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point ofintersection of regular society with society which is accursed.</p><p>The thief also has his food for cannon, stealable matter, you, I, whoeverpasses by; <i>le pantre</i>. (<i>Pan</i>, everybody.)</p><p>Slang is language turned convict.</p><p>That the thinking principle of man be thrust down ever so low, that it canbe dragged and pinioned there by obscure tyrannies of fatality, that itcan be bound by no one knows what fetters in that abyss, is sufficient tocreate consternation.</p><p>Oh, poor thought of miserable wretches!</p><p>Alas! will no one come to the succor of the human soul in that darkness?Is it her destiny there to await forever the mind, the liberator, theimmense rider of Pegasi and hippogriffs, the combatant of heroes of thedawn who shall descend from the azure between two wings, the radiantknight of the future? Will she forever summon in vain to her assistancethe lance of light of the ideal? Is she condemned to hear the fearfulapproach of Evil through the density of the gulf, and to catch glimpses,nearer and nearer at hand, beneath the hideous water of that dragon&rsquo;shead, that maw streaked with foam, and that writhing undulation of claws,swellings, and rings? Must it remain there, without a gleam of light,without hope, given over to that terrible approach, vaguely scented out bythe monster, shuddering, dishevelled, wringing its arms, forever chainedto the rock of night, a sombre Andromeda white and naked amid the shadows!</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0254" id="link2HCH0254"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;SLANG WHICH WEEPS AND SLANG WHICH LAUGHS</h3><p>As the reader perceives, slang in its entirety, slang of four hundredyears ago, like the slang of to-day, is permeated with that sombre,symbolical spirit which gives to all words a mien which is now mournful,now menacing. One feels in it the wild and ancient sadness of thosevagrants of the Court of Miracles who played at cards with packs of theirown, some of which have come down to us. The eight of clubs, for instance,represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous trefoil leaves, a sort offantastic personification of the forest. At the foot of this tree a firewas burning, over which three hares were roasting a huntsman on a spit,and behind him, on another fire, hung a steaming pot, whence emerged thehead of a dog. Nothing can be more melancholy than these reprisals inpainting, by a pack of cards, in the presence of stakes for the roastingof smugglers and of the cauldron for the boiling of counterfeiters. Thediverse forms assumed by thought in the realm of slang, even song, evenraillery, even menace, all partook of this powerless and dejectedcharacter. All the songs, the melodies of some of which have beencollected, were humble and lamentable to the point of evoking tears. The<i>pègre</i> is always the poor <i>pègre</i>, and he is always the hare in hiding, thefugitive mouse, the flying bird. He hardly complains, he contents himselfwith sighing; one of his moans has come down to us: &ldquo;I do not understandhow God, the father of men, can torture his children and his grandchildrenand hear them cry, without himself suffering torture.&rdquo;<ahref="#linknote-43" name="linknoteref-43" id="linknoteref-43">43</a> Thewretch, whenever he has time to think, makes himself small before the low,and frail in the presence of society; he lies down flat on his face, heentreats, he appeals to the side of compassion; we feel that he isconscious of his guilt.</p><p>Towards the middle of the last century a change took place, prison songsand thieves&rsquo; ritournelles assumed, so to speak, an insolent and jovialmien. The plaintive <i>maluré</i> was replaced by the <i>larifla</i>. We find in theeighteenth century, in nearly all the songs of the galleys and prisons, adiabolical and enigmatical gayety. We hear this strident and liltingrefrain which we should say had been lighted up by a phosphorescent gleam,and which seems to have been flung into the forest by a will-o&rsquo;-the-wispplaying the fife:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Miralabi suslababo<br/>Mirliton ribonribette<br/>Surlababi mirlababo<br/>Mirliton ribonribo.</p><p>This was sung in a cellar or in a nook of the forest while cutting a man&rsquo;sthroat.</p><p>A serious symptom. In the eighteenth century, the ancient melancholy ofthe dejected classes vanishes. They began to laugh. They rally the <i>grandmeg</i> and the <i>grand dab</i>. Given Louis XV. they call the King of France &ldquo;leMarquis de Pantin.&rdquo; And behold, they are almost gay. A sort of gleamproceeds from these miserable wretches, as though their consciences werenot heavy within them any more. These lamentable tribes of darkness haveno longer merely the desperate audacity of actions, they possess theheedless audacity of mind. A sign that they are losing the sense of theircriminality, and that they feel, even among thinkers and dreamers, someindefinable support which the latter themselves know not of. A sign thattheft and pillage are beginning to filter into doctrines and sophisms, insuch a way as to lose somewhat of their ugliness, while communicating muchof it to sophisms and doctrines. A sign, in short, of some outbreak whichis prodigious and near unless some diversion shall arise.</p><p>Let us pause a moment. Whom are we accusing here? Is it the eighteenthcentury? Is it philosophy? Certainly not. The work of the eighteenthcentury is healthy and good and wholesome. The encyclopedists, Diderot attheir head; the physiocrates, Turgot at their head; the philosophers,Voltaire at their head; the Utopians, Rousseau at their head,&mdash;theseare four sacred legions. Humanity&rsquo;s immense advance towards the light isdue to them. They are the four vanguards of the human race, marchingtowards the four cardinal points of progress. Diderot towards thebeautiful, Turgot towards the useful, Voltaire towards the true, Rousseautowards the just. But by the side of and above the philosophers, therewere the sophists, a venomous vegetation mingled with a healthy growth,hemlock in the virgin forest. While the executioner was burning the greatbooks of the liberators of the century on the grand staircase of thecourt-house, writers now forgotten were publishing, with the King&rsquo;ssanction, no one knows what strangely disorganizing writings, which wereeagerly read by the unfortunate. Some of these publications, odd to say,which were patronized by a prince, are to be found in the Secret Library.These facts, significant but unknown, were imperceptible on the surface.Sometimes, in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger. It is obscurebecause it is underhand. Of all these writers, the one who probably thenexcavated in the masses the most unhealthy gallery was Restif de LaBretonne.</p><p>This work, peculiar to the whole of Europe, effected more ravages inGermany than anywhere else. In Germany, during a given period, summed upby Schiller in his famous drama <i>The Robbers</i>, theft and pillage rose up inprotest against property and labor, assimilated certain specious and falseelementary ideas, which, though just in appearance, were absurd inreality, enveloped themselves in these ideas, disappeared within them,after a fashion, assumed an abstract name, passed into the state oftheory, and in that shape circulated among the laborious, suffering, andhonest masses, unknown even to the imprudent chemists who had prepared themixture, unknown even to the masses who accepted it. Whenever a fact ofthis sort presents itself, the case is grave. Suffering engenders wrath;and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall asleep, which isthe same thing as shutting one&rsquo;s eyes, the hatred of the unfortunateclasses lights its torch at some aggrieved or ill-made spirit which dreamsin a corner, and sets itself to the scrutiny of society. The scrutiny ofhatred is a terrible thing.</p><p>Hence, if the ill-fortune of the times so wills it, those fearfulcommotions which were formerly called <i>jacqueries</i>, beside which purelypolitical agitations are the merest child&rsquo;s play, which are no longer theconflict of the oppressed and the oppressor, but the revolt of discomfortagainst comfort. Then everything crumbles.</p><p>Jacqueries are earthquakes of the people.</p><p>It is this peril, possibly imminent towards the close of the eighteenthcentury, which the French Revolution, that immense act of probity, cutshort.</p><p>The French Revolution, which is nothing else than the idea armed with thesword, rose erect, and, with the same abrupt movement, closed the door ofill and opened the door of good.</p><p>It put a stop to torture, promulgated the truth, expelled miasma, renderedthe century healthy, crowned the populace.</p><p>It may be said of it that it created man a second time, by giving him asecond soul, the right.</p><p>The nineteenth century has inherited and profited by its work, and to-day,the social catastrophe to which we lately alluded is simply impossible.Blind is he who announces it! Foolish is he who fears it! Revolution isthe vaccine of Jacquerie.</p><p>Thanks to the Revolution, social conditions have changed. Feudal andmonarchical maladies no longer run in our blood. There is no more of theMiddle Ages in our constitution. We no longer live in the days whenterrible swarms within made irruptions, when one heard beneath his feetthe obscure course of a dull rumble, when indescribable elevations frommole-like tunnels appeared on the surface of civilization, where the soilcracked open, where the roofs of caverns yawned, and where one suddenlybeheld monstrous heads emerging from the earth.</p><p>The revolutionary sense is a moral sense. The sentiment of right, oncedeveloped, develops the sentiment of duty. The law of all is liberty,which ends where the liberty of others begins, according to Robespierre&rsquo;sadmirable definition. Since &rsquo;89, the whole people has been dilating into asublime individual; there is not a poor man, who, possessing his right,has not his ray of sun; the die-of-hunger feels within him the honesty ofFrance; the dignity of the citizen is an internal armor; he who is free isscrupulous; he who votes reigns. Hence incorruptibility; hence themiscarriage of unhealthy lusts; hence eyes heroically lowered beforetemptations. The revolutionary wholesomeness is such, that on a day ofdeliverance, a 14th of July, a 10th of August, there is no longer anypopulace. The first cry of the enlightened and increasing throngs is:death to thieves! Progress is an honest man; the ideal and the absolute donot filch pocket-handkerchiefs. By whom were the wagons containing thewealth of the Tuileries escorted in 1848? By the rag-pickers of theFaubourg Saint-Antoine. Rags mounted guard over the treasure. Virtuerendered these tatterdemalions resplendent. In those wagons in chests,hardly closed, and some, even, half-open, amid a hundred dazzling caskets,was that ancient crown of France, studded with diamonds, surmounted by thecarbuncle of royalty, by the Regent diamond, which was worth thirtymillions. Barefooted, they guarded that crown.</p><p>Hence, no more Jacquerie. I regret it for the sake of the skilful. The oldfear has produced its last effects in that quarter; and henceforth it canno longer be employed in politics. The principal spring of the red spectreis broken. Every one knows it now. The scare-crow scares no longer. Thebirds take liberties with the mannikin, foul creatures alight upon it, thebourgeois laugh at it.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0255" id="link2HCH0255"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE TWO DUTIES: TO WATCH AND TO HOPE</h3><p>This being the case, is all social danger dispelled? Certainly not. Thereis no Jacquerie; society may rest assured on that point; blood will nolonger rush to its head. But let society take heed to the manner in whichit breathes. Apoplexy is no longer to be feared, but phthisis is there.Social phthisis is called misery.</p><p>One can perish from being undermined as well as from being struck bylightning.</p><p>Let us not weary of repeating, and sympathetic souls must not forget thatthis is the first of fraternal obligations, and selfish hearts mustunderstand that the first of political necessities consists in thinkingfirst of all of the disinherited and sorrowing throngs, in solacing,airing, enlightening, loving them, in enlarging their horizon to amagnificent extent, in lavishing upon them education in every form, inoffering them the example of labor, never the example of idleness, indiminishing the individual burden by enlarging the notion of the universalaim, in setting a limit to poverty without setting a limit to wealth, increating vast fields of public and popular activity, in having, likeBriareus, a hundred hands to extend in all directions to the oppressed andthe feeble, in employing the collective power for that grand duty ofopening workshops for all arms, schools for all aptitudes, andlaboratories for all degrees of intelligence, in augmenting salaries,diminishing trouble, balancing what should be and what is, that is to say,in proportioning enjoyment to effort and a glut to need; in a word, inevolving from the social apparatus more light and more comfort for thebenefit of those who suffer and those who are ignorant.</p><p>And, let us say it, all this is but the beginning. The true question isthis: labor cannot be a law without being a right.</p><p>We will not insist upon this point; this is not the proper place for that.</p><p>If nature calls itself Providence, society should call itself foresight.</p><p>Intellectual and moral growth is no less indispensable than materialimprovement. To know is a sacrament, to think is the prime necessity,truth is nourishment as well as grain. A reason which fasts from scienceand wisdom grows thin. Let us enter equal complaint against stomachs andminds which do not eat. If there is anything more heart-breaking than abody perishing for lack of bread, it is a soul which is dying from hungerfor the light.</p><p>The whole of progress tends in the direction of solution. Some day weshall be amazed. As the human race mounts upward, the deep layers emergenaturally from the zone of distress. The obliteration of misery will beaccomplished by a simple elevation of level.</p><p>We should do wrong were we to doubt this blessed consummation.</p><p>The past is very strong, it is true, at the present moment. It censures.This rejuvenation of a corpse is surprising. Behold, it is walking andadvancing. It seems a victor; this dead body is a conqueror. He arriveswith his legions, superstitions, with his sword, despotism, with hisbanner, ignorance; a while ago, he won ten battles. He advances, hethreatens, he laughs, he is at our doors. Let us not despair, on our side.Let us sell the field on which Hannibal is encamped.</p><p>What have we to fear, we who believe?</p><p>No such thing as a back-flow of ideas exists any more than there exists areturn of a river on its course.</p><p>But let those who do not desire a future reflect on this matter. When theysay &ldquo;no&rdquo; to progress, it is not the future but themselves that they arecondemning. They are giving themselves a sad malady; they are inoculatingthemselves with the past. There is but one way of rejecting To-morrow, andthat is to die.</p><p>Now, no death, that of the body as late as possible, that of the soulnever,&mdash;this is what we desire.</p><p>Yes, the enigma will utter its word, the sphinx will speak, the problemwill be solved.</p><p>Yes, the people, sketched out by the eighteenth century, will be finishedby the nineteenth. He who doubts this is an idiot! The future blossoming,the near blossoming forth of universal well-being, is a divinely fatalphenomenon.</p><p>Immense combined propulsions direct human affairs and conduct them withina given time to a logical state, that is to say, to a state ofequilibrium; that is to say, to equity. A force composed of earth andheaven results from humanity and governs it; this force is a worker ofmiracles; marvellous issues are no more difficult to it than extraordinaryvicissitudes. Aided by science, which comes from one man, and by theevent, which comes from another, it is not greatly alarmed by thesecontradictions in the attitude of problems, which seem impossibilities tothe vulgar herd. It is no less skilful at causing a solution to springforth from the reconciliation of ideas, than a lesson from thereconciliation of facts, and we may expect anything from that mysteriouspower of progress, which brought the Orient and the Occident face to faceone fine day, in the depths of a sepulchre, and made the imaums conversewith Bonaparte in the interior of the Great Pyramid.</p><p>In the meantime, let there be no halt, no hesitation, no pause in thegrandiose onward march of minds. Social philosophy consists essentially inscience and peace. Its object is, and its result must be, to dissolvewrath by the study of antagonisms. It examines, it scrutinizes, itanalyzes; then it puts together once more, it proceeds by means ofreduction, discarding all hatred.</p><p>More than once, a society has been seen to give way before the wind whichis let loose upon mankind; history is full of the shipwrecks of nationsand empires; manners, customs, laws, religions,&mdash;and some fine daythat unknown force, the hurricane, passes by and bears them all away. Thecivilizations of India, of Chaldea, of Persia, of Syria, of Egypt, havedisappeared one after the other. Why? We know not. What are the causes ofthese disasters? We do not know. Could these societies have been saved?Was it their fault? Did they persist in the fatal vice which destroyedthem? What is the amount of suicide in these terrible deaths of a nationand a race? Questions to which there exists no reply. Darkness enwrapscondemned civilizations. They sprung a leak, then they sank. We havenothing more to say; and it is with a sort of terror that we look on, atthe bottom of that sea which is called the past, behind those colossalwaves, at the shipwreck of those immense vessels, Babylon, Nineveh,Tarsus, Thebes, Rome, beneath the fearful gusts which emerge from all themouths of the shadows. But shadows are there, and light is here. We arenot acquainted with the maladies of these ancient civilizations, we do notknow the infirmities of our own. Everywhere upon it we have the right oflight, we contemplate its beauties, we lay bare its defects. Where it isill, we probe; and the sickness once diagnosed, the study of the causeleads to the discovery of the remedy. Our civilization, the work of twentycenturies, is its law and its prodigy; it is worth the trouble of saving.It will be saved. It is already much to have solaced it; its enlightenmentis yet another point. All the labors of modern social philosophies mustconverge towards this point. The thinker of to-day has a great duty&mdash;toauscultate civilization.</p><p>We repeat, that this auscultation brings encouragement; it is by thispersistence in encouragement that we wish to conclude these pages, anaustere interlude in a mournful drama. Beneath the social mortality, wefeel human imperishableness. The globe does not perish, because it hasthese wounds, craters, eruptions, sulphur pits, here and there, norbecause of a volcano which ejects its pus. The maladies of the people donot kill man.</p><p>And yet, any one who follows the course of social clinics shakes his headat times. The strongest, the tenderest, the most logical have their hoursof weakness.</p><p>Will the future arrive? It seems as though we might almost put thisquestion, when we behold so much terrible darkness. Melancholyface-to-face encounter of selfish and wretched. On the part of theselfish, the prejudices, shadows of costly education, appetite increasingthrough intoxication, a giddiness of prosperity which dulls, a fear ofsuffering which, in some, goes as far as an aversion for the suffering, animplacable satisfaction, the <i>I</i> so swollen that it bars the soul; on theside of the wretched covetousness, envy, hatred of seeing others enjoy,the profound impulses of the human beast towards assuaging its desires,hearts full of mist, sadness, need, fatality, impure and simple ignorance.</p><p>Shall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven? is the luminous point whichwe distinguish there one of those which vanish? The ideal is frightful tobehold, thus lost in the depths, small, isolated, imperceptible,brilliant, but surrounded by those great, black menaces, monstrouslyheaped around it; yet no more in danger than a star in the maw of theclouds.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0295" id="link2H_4_0295"></a>BOOK EIGHTH&mdash;ENCHANTMENTS AND DESOLATIONS</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0256" id="link2HCH0256"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;FULL LIGHT</h3><p>The reader has probably understood that Éponine, having recognized throughthe gate, the inhabitant of that Rue Plumet whither Magnon had sent her,had begun by keeping the ruffians away from the Rue Plumet, and had thenconducted Marius thither, and that, after many days spent in ecstasybefore that gate, Marius, drawn on by that force which draws the iron tothe magnet and a lover towards the stones of which is built the house ofher whom he loves, had finally entered Cosette&rsquo;s garden as Romeo enteredthe garden of Juliet. This had even proved easier for him than for Romeo;Romeo was obliged to scale a wall, Marius had only to use a little forceon one of the bars of the decrepit gate which vacillated in its rustyrecess, after the fashion of old people&rsquo;s teeth. Marius was slender andreadily passed through.</p><p>As there was never any one in the street, and as Marius never entered thegarden except at night, he ran no risk of being seen.</p><p>Beginning with that blessed and holy hour when a kiss betrothed these twosouls, Marius was there every evening. If, at that period of herexistence, Cosette had fallen in love with a man in the least unscrupulousor debauched, she would have been lost; for there are generous natureswhich yield themselves, and Cosette was one of them. One of woman&rsquo;smagnanimities is to yield. Love, at the height where it is absolute, iscomplicated with some indescribably celestial blindness of modesty. Butwhat dangers you run, O noble souls! Often you give the heart, and we takethe body. Your heart remains with you, you gaze upon it in the gloom witha shudder. Love has no middle course; it either ruins or it saves. Allhuman destiny lies in this dilemma. This dilemma, ruin, or safety, is setforth no more inexorably by any fatality than by love. Love is life, if itis not death. Cradle; also coffin. The same sentiment says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the human heart. Of all the things that God has made, the human heartis the one which sheds the most light, alas! and the most darkness.</p><p>God willed that Cosette&rsquo;s love should encounter one of the loves whichsave.</p><p>Throughout the whole of the month of May of that year 1832, there werethere, in every night, in that poor, neglected garden, beneath thatthicket which grew thicker and more fragrant day by day, two beingscomposed of all chastity, all innocence, overflowing with all the felicityof heaven, nearer to the archangels than to mankind, pure, honest,intoxicated, radiant, who shone for each other amid the shadows. It seemedto Cosette that Marius had a crown, and to Marius that Cosette had animbus. They touched each other, they gazed at each other, they claspedeach other&rsquo;s hands, they pressed close to each other; but there was adistance which they did not pass. Not that they respected it; they did notknow of its existence. Marius was conscious of a barrier, Cosette&rsquo;sinnocence; and Cosette of a support, Marius&rsquo; loyalty. The first kiss hadalso been the last. Marius, since that time, had not gone further than totouch Cosette&rsquo;s hand, or her kerchief, or a lock of her hair, with hislips. For him, Cosette was a perfume and not a woman. He inhaled her. Sherefused nothing, and he asked nothing. Cosette was happy, and Marius wassatisfied. They lived in this ecstatic state which can be described as thedazzling of one soul by another soul. It was the ineffable first embraceof two maiden souls in the ideal. Two swans meeting on the Jungfrau.</p><p>At that hour of love, an hour when voluptuousness is absolutely mute,beneath the omnipotence of ecstasy, Marius, the pure and seraphic Marius,would rather have gone to a woman of the town than have raised Cosette&rsquo;srobe to the height of her ankle. Once, in the moonlight, Cosette stoopedto pick up something on the ground, her bodice fell apart and permitted aglimpse of the beginning of her throat. Marius turned away his eyes.</p><p>What took place between these two beings? Nothing. They adored each other.</p><p>At night, when they were there, that garden seemed a living and a sacredspot. All flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense; and theyopened their souls and scattered them over the flowers. The wanton andvigorous vegetation quivered, full of strength and intoxication, aroundthese two innocents, and they uttered words of love which set the trees totrembling.</p><p>What words were these? Breaths. Nothing more. These breaths sufficed totrouble and to touch all nature round about. Magic power which we shouldfind it difficult to understand were we to read in a book theseconversations which are made to be borne away and dispersed like smokewreaths by the breeze beneath the leaves. Take from those murmurs of twolovers that melody which proceeds from the soul and which accompanies themlike a lyre, and what remains is nothing more than a shade; you say:&ldquo;What! is that all!&rdquo; eh! yes, childish prattle, repetitions, laughter atnothing, nonsense, everything that is deepest and most sublime in theworld! The only things which are worth the trouble of saying and hearing!</p><p>The man who has never heard, the man who has never uttered theseabsurdities, these paltry remarks, is an imbecile and a malicious fellow.Cosette said to Marius:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Dost thou know?&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>[In all this and athwart this celestial maidenliness, and without eitherof them being able to say how it had come about, they had begun to calleach other <i>thou</i>.]</p><p>&ldquo;Dost thou know? My name is Euphrasie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Euphrasie? Why, no, thy name is Cosette.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Cosette is a very ugly name that was given to me when I was a littlething. But my real name is Euphrasie. Dost thou like that name&mdash;Euphrasie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes. But Cosette is not ugly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you like it better than Euphrasie?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I like it better too. Truly, it is pretty, Cosette. Call meCosette.&rdquo;</p><p>And the smile that she added made of this dialogue an idyl worthy of agrove situated in heaven. On another occasion she gazed intently at himand exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur, you are handsome, you are good-looking, you are witty, you arenot at all stupid, you are much more learned than I am, but I bid youdefiance with this word: I love you!&rdquo;</p><p>And Marius, in the very heavens, thought he heard a strain sung by a star.</p><p>Or she bestowed on him a gentle tap because he coughed, and she said tohim:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cough, sir; I will not have people cough on my domain without mypermission. It&rsquo;s very naughty to cough and to disturb me. I want you to bewell, because, in the first place, if you were not well, I should be veryunhappy. What should I do then?&rdquo;</p><p>And this was simply divine.</p><p>Once Marius said to Cosette:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Just imagine, I thought at one time that your name was Ursule.&rdquo;</p><p>This made both of them laugh the whole evening.</p><p>In the middle of another conversation, he chanced to exclaim:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! One day, at the Luxembourg, I had a good mind to finish breaking up aveteran!&rdquo; But he stopped short, and went no further. He would have beenobliged to speak to Cosette of her garter, and that was impossible. Thisbordered on a strange theme, the flesh, before which that immense andinnocent love recoiled with a sort of sacred fright.</p><p>Marius pictured life with Cosette to himself like this, without anythingelse; to come every evening to the Rue Plumet, to displace the old andaccommodating bar of the chief-justice&rsquo;s gate, to sit elbow to elbow onthat bench, to gaze through the trees at the scintillation of theon-coming night, to fit a fold of the knee of his trousers into the amplefall of Cosette&rsquo;s gown, to caress her thumb-nail, to call her <i>thou</i>, tosmell of the same flower, one after the other, forever, indefinitely.During this time, clouds passed above their heads. Every time that thewind blows it bears with it more of the dreams of men than of the cloudsof heaven.</p><p>This chaste, almost shy love was not devoid of gallantry, by any means. Topay compliments to the woman whom a man loves is the first method ofbestowing caresses, and he is half audacious who tries it. A compliment issomething like a kiss through a veil. Voluptuousness mingles there withits sweet tiny point, while it hides itself. The heart draws back beforevoluptuousness only to love the more. Marius&rsquo; blandishments, all saturatedwith fancy, were, so to speak, of azure hue. The birds when they fly upyonder, in the direction of the angels, must hear such words. There weremingled with them, nevertheless, life, humanity, all the positiveness ofwhich Marius was capable. It was what is said in the bower, a prelude towhat will be said in the chamber; a lyrical effusion, strophe and sonnetintermingled, pleasing hyperboles of cooing, all the refinements ofadoration arranged in a bouquet and exhaling a celestial perfume, anineffable twitter of heart to heart.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Marius, &ldquo;how beautiful you are! I dare not look at you. Itis all over with me when I contemplate you. You are a grace. I know notwhat is the matter with me. The hem of your gown, when the tip of yourshoe peeps from beneath, upsets me. And then, what an enchanted gleam whenyou open your thought even but a little! You talk astonishingly goodsense. It seems to me at times that you are a dream. Speak, I listen, Iadmire. Oh Cosette! how strange it is and how charming! I am really besidemyself. You are adorable, Mademoiselle. I study your feet with themicroscope and your soul with the telescope.&rdquo;</p><p>And Cosette answered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have been loving a little more all the time that has passed since thismorning.&rdquo;</p><p>Questions and replies took care of themselves in this dialogue, whichalways turned with mutual consent upon love, as the little pith figuresalways turn on their peg.</p><p>Cosette&rsquo;s whole person was ingenuousness, ingenuity, transparency,whiteness, candor, radiance. It might have been said of Cosette that shewas clear. She produced on those who saw her the sensation of April anddawn. There was dew in her eyes. Cosette was a condensation of the aurorallight in the form of a woman.</p><p>It was quite simple that Marius should admire her, since he adored her.But the truth is, that this little school-girl, fresh from the convent,talked with exquisite penetration and uttered, at times, all sorts of trueand delicate sayings. Her prattle was conversation. She never made amistake about anything, and she saw things justly. The woman feels andspeaks with the tender instinct of the heart, which is infallible.</p><p>No one understands so well as a woman, how to say things that are, atonce, both sweet and deep. Sweetness and depth, they are the whole ofwoman; in them lies the whole of heaven.</p><p>In this full felicity, tears welled up to their eyes every instant. Acrushed lady-bug, a feather fallen from a nest, a branch of hawthornbroken, aroused their pity, and their ecstasy, sweetly mingled withmelancholy, seemed to ask nothing better than to weep. The most sovereignsymptom of love is a tenderness that is, at times, almost unbearable.</p><p>And, in addition to this,&mdash;all these contradictions are the lightningplay of love,&mdash;they were fond of laughing, they laughed readily andwith a delicious freedom, and so familiarly that they sometimes presentedthe air of two boys.</p><p>Still, though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity, nature is alwayspresent and will not be forgotten. She is there with her brutal andsublime object; and however great may be the innocence of souls, one feelsin the most modest private interview, the adorable and mysterious shadewhich separates a couple of lovers from a pair of friends.</p><p>They idolized each other.</p><p>The permanent and the immutable are persistent. People live, they smile,they laugh, they make little grimaces with the tips of their lips, theyinterlace their fingers, they call each other <i>thou</i>, and that does notprevent eternity.</p><p>Two lovers hide themselves in the evening, in the twilight, in theinvisible, with the birds, with the roses; they fascinate each other inthe darkness with their hearts which they throw into their eyes, theymurmur, they whisper, and in the meantime, immense librations of theplanets fill the infinite universe.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0257" id="link2HCH0257"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE BEWILDERMENT OF PERFECT HAPPINESS</h3><p>They existed vaguely, frightened at their happiness. They did not noticethe cholera which decimated Paris precisely during that very month. Theyhad confided in each other as far as possible, but this had not extendedmuch further than their names. Marius had told Cosette that he was anorphan, that his name was Marius Pontmercy, that he was a lawyer, that helived by writing things for publishers, that his father had been acolonel, that the latter had been a hero, and that he, Marius, was on badterms with his grandfather who was rich. He had also hinted at being abaron, but this had produced no effect on Cosette. She did not know themeaning of the word. Marius was Marius. On her side, she had confided tohim that she had been brought up at the Petit-Picpus convent, that hermother, like his own, was dead, that her father&rsquo;s name was M.Fauchelevent, that he was very good, that he gave a great deal to thepoor, but that he was poor himself, and that he denied himself everythingthough he denied her nothing.</p><p>Strange to say, in the sort of symphony which Marius had lived since hehad been in the habit of seeing Cosette, the past, even the most recentpast, had become so confused and distant to him, that what Cosette toldhim satisfied him completely. It did not even occur to him to tell herabout the nocturnal adventure in the hovel, about Thénardier, about theburn, and about the strange attitude and singular flight of her father.Marius had momentarily forgotten all this; in the evening he did not evenknow that there had been a morning, what he had done, where he hadbreakfasted, nor who had spoken to him; he had songs in his ears whichrendered him deaf to every other thought; he only existed at the hourswhen he saw Cosette. Then, as he was in heaven, it was quite natural thathe should forget earth. Both bore languidly the indefinable burden ofimmaterial pleasures. Thus lived these somnambulists who are calledlovers.</p><p>Alas! Who is there who has not felt all these things? Why does there comean hour when one emerges from this azure, and why does life go onafterwards?</p><p>Loving almost takes the place of thinking. Love is an ardent forgetfulnessof all the rest. Then ask logic of passion if you will. There is no moreabsolute logical sequence in the human heart than there is a perfectgeometrical figure in the celestial mechanism. For Cosette and Mariusnothing existed except Marius and Cosette. The universe around them hadfallen into a hole. They lived in a golden minute. There was nothingbefore them, nothing behind. It hardly occurred to Marius that Cosette hada father. His brain was dazzled and obliterated. Of what did these loverstalk then? We have seen, of the flowers, and the swallows, the setting sunand the rising moon, and all sorts of important things. They had told eachother everything except everything. The everything of lovers is nothing.But the father, the realities, that lair, the ruffians, that adventure, towhat purpose? And was he very sure that this nightmare had actuallyexisted? They were two, and they adored each other, and beyond that therewas nothing. Nothing else existed. It is probable that this vanishing ofhell in our rear is inherent to the arrival of paradise. Have we behelddemons? Are there any? Have we trembled? Have we suffered? We no longerknow. A rosy cloud hangs over it.</p><p>So these two beings lived in this manner, high aloft, with all thatimprobability which is in nature; neither at the nadir nor at the zenith,between man and seraphim, above the mire, below the ether, in the clouds;hardly flesh and blood, soul and ecstasy from head to foot; already toosublime to walk the earth, still too heavily charged with humanity todisappear in the blue, suspended like atoms which are waiting to beprecipitated; apparently beyond the bounds of destiny; ignorant of thatrut; yesterday, to-day, to-morrow; amazed, rapturous, floating, soaring;at times so light that they could take their flight out into the infinite;almost prepared to soar away to all eternity. They slept wide-awake, thussweetly lulled. Oh! splendid lethargy of the real overwhelmed by theideal.</p><p>Sometimes, beautiful as Cosette was, Marius shut his eyes in her presence.The best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes.</p><p>Marius and Cosette never asked themselves whither this was to lead them.They considered that they had already arrived. It is a strange claim onman&rsquo;s part to wish that love should lead to something.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0258" id="link2HCH0258"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE BEGINNING OF SHADOW</h3><p>Jean Valjean suspected nothing.</p><p>Cosette, who was rather less dreamy than Marius, was gay, and thatsufficed for Jean Valjean&rsquo;s happiness. The thoughts which Cosettecherished, her tender preoccupations, Marius&rsquo; image which filled herheart, took away nothing from the incomparable purity of her beautiful,chaste, and smiling brow. She was at the age when the virgin bears herlove as the angel his lily. So Jean Valjean was at ease. And then, whentwo lovers have come to an understanding, things always go well; the thirdparty who might disturb their love is kept in a state of perfect blindnessby a restricted number of precautions which are always the same in thecase of all lovers. Thus, Cosette never objected to any of Jean Valjean&rsquo;sproposals. Did she want to take a walk? &ldquo;Yes, dear little father.&rdquo; Did shewant to stay at home? Very good. Did he wish to pass the evening withCosette? She was delighted. As he always went to bed at ten o&rsquo;clock,Marius did not come to the garden on such occasions until after that hour,when, from the street, he heard Cosette open the long glass door on theveranda. Of course, no one ever met Marius in the daytime. Jean Valjeannever even dreamed any longer that Marius was in existence. Only once, onemorning, he chanced to say to Cosette: &ldquo;Why, you have whitewash on yourback!&rdquo; On the previous evening, Marius, in a transport, had pushed Cosetteagainst the wall.</p><p>Old Toussaint, who retired early, thought of nothing but her sleep, andwas as ignorant of the whole matter as Jean Valjean.</p><p>Marius never set foot in the house. When he was with Cosette, they hidthemselves in a recess near the steps, in order that they might neither beseen nor heard from the street, and there they sat, frequently contentingthemselves, by way of conversation, with pressing each other&rsquo;s handstwenty times a minute as they gazed at the branches of the trees. At suchtimes, a thunderbolt might have fallen thirty paces from them, and theywould not have noticed it, so deeply was the reverie of the one absorbedand sunk in the reverie of the other.</p><p>Limpid purity. Hours wholly white; almost all alike. This sort of love isa recollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove.</p><p>The whole extent of the garden lay between them and the street. Every timethat Marius entered and left, he carefully adjusted the bar of the gate insuch a manner that no displacement was visible.</p><p>He usually went away about midnight, and returned to Courfeyrac&rsquo;slodgings. Courfeyrac said to Bahorel:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Would you believe it? Marius comes home nowadays at one o&rsquo;clock in themorning.&rdquo;</p><p>Bahorel replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you expect? There&rsquo;s always a petard in a seminary fellow.&rdquo;</p><p>At times, Courfeyrac folded his arms, assumed a serious air, and said toMarius:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You are getting irregular in your habits, young man.&rdquo;</p><p>Courfeyrac, being a practical man, did not take in good part thisreflection of an invisible paradise upon Marius; he was not much in thehabit of concealed passions; it made him impatient, and now and then hecalled upon Marius to come back to reality.</p><p>One morning, he threw him this admonition:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, you produce upon me the effect of being located in themoon, the realm of dreams, the province of illusions, capital,soap-bubble. Come, be a good boy, what&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p><p>But nothing could induce Marius &ldquo;to talk.&rdquo; They might have torn out hisnails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffable name,Cosette, was composed. True love is as luminous as the dawn and as silentas the tomb. Only, Courfeyrac saw this change in Marius, that histaciturnity was of the beaming order.</p><p>During this sweet month of May, Marius and Cosette learned to know theseimmense delights. To dispute and to say <i>you</i> for <i>thou</i>, simply that theymight say <i>thou</i> the better afterwards. To talk at great length with veryminute details, of persons in whom they took not the slightest interest inthe world; another proof that in that ravishing opera called love, thelibretto counts for almost nothing;</p><p>For Marius, to listen to Cosette discussing finery;</p><p>For Cosette, to listen to Marius talk in politics;</p><p>To listen, knee pressed to knee, to the carriages rolling along the Rue deBabylone;</p><p>To gaze upon the same planet in space, or at the same glowworm gleaming inthe grass;</p><p>To hold their peace together; a still greater delight than conversation;</p><p>Etc., etc.</p><p>In the meantime, divers complications were approaching.</p><p>One evening, Marius was on his way to the rendezvous, by way of theBoulevard des Invalides. He habitually walked with drooping head. As hewas on the point of turning the corner of the Rue Plumet, he heard someone quite close to him say:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Good evening, Monsieur Marius.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised his head and recognized Éponine.</p><p>This produced a singular effect upon him. He had not thought of that girla single time since the day when she had conducted him to the Rue Plumet,he had not seen her again, and she had gone completely out of his mind. Hehad no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her, he owed her hishappiness, and yet, it was embarrassing to him to meet her.</p><p>It is an error to think that passion, when it is pure and happy, leads manto a state of perfection; it simply leads him, as we have noted, to astate of oblivion. In this situation, man forgets to be bad, but he alsoforgets to be good. Gratitude, duty, matters essential and important to beremembered, vanish. At any other time, Marius would have behaved quitedifferently to Éponine. Absorbed in Cosette, he had not even clearly putit to himself that this Éponine was named Éponine Thénardier, and that shebore the name inscribed in his father&rsquo;s will, that name, for which, but afew months before, he would have so ardently sacrificed himself. We showMarius as he was. His father himself was fading out of his soul to someextent, under the splendor of his love.</p><p>He replied with some embarrassment:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! so it&rsquo;s you, Éponine?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you call me <i>you?</i> Have I done anything to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered.</p><p>Certainly, he had nothing against her. Far from it. Only, he felt that hecould not do otherwise, now that he used <i>thou</i> to Cosette, than say <i>you</i> toÉponine.</p><p>As he remained silent, she exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Say&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>Then she paused. It seemed as though words failed that creature formerlyso heedless and so bold. She tried to smile and could not. Then sheresumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>Then she paused again, and remained with downcast eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Marius,&rdquo; said she suddenly and abruptly; and away shewent.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0259" id="link2HCH0259"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;A CAB RUNS IN ENGLISH AND BARKS IN SLANG</h3><p>The following day was the 3d of June, 1832, a date which it is necessaryto indicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung on thehorizon of Paris in the state of lightning-charged clouds. Marius, atnightfall, was pursuing the same road as on the preceding evening, withthe same thoughts of delight in his heart, when he caught sight of Éponineapproaching, through the trees of the boulevard. Two days in succession&mdash;thiswas too much. He turned hastily aside, quitted the boulevard, changed hiscourse and went to the Rue Plumet through the Rue Monsieur.</p><p>This caused Éponine to follow him to the Rue Plumet, a thing which she hadnot yet done. Up to that time, she had contented herself with watching himon his passage along the boulevard without ever seeking to encounter him.It was only on the evening before that she had attempted to address him.</p><p>So Éponine followed him, without his suspecting the fact. She saw himdisplace the bar and slip into the garden.</p><p>She approached the railing, felt of the bars one after the other, andreadily recognized the one which Marius had moved.</p><p>She murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;None of that, Lisette!&rdquo;</p><p>She seated herself on the underpinning of the railing, close beside thebar, as though she were guarding it. It was precisely at the point wherethe railing touched the neighboring wall. There was a dim nook there, inwhich Éponine was entirely concealed.</p><p>She remained thus for more than an hour, without stirring and withoutbreathing, a prey to her thoughts.</p><p>Towards ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening, one of the two or three persons whopassed through the Rue Plumet, an old, belated bourgeois who was makinghaste to escape from this deserted spot of evil repute, as he skirted thegarden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall, heard adull and threatening voice saying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no longer surprised that he comes here every evening.&rdquo;</p><p>The passer-by cast a glance around him, saw no one, dared not peer intothe black niche, and was greatly alarmed. He redoubled his pace.</p><p>This passer-by had reason to make haste, for a very few instants later,six men, who were marching separately and at some distance from eachother, along the wall, and who might have been taken for a gray patrol,entered the Rue Plumet.</p><p>The first to arrive at the garden railing halted, and waited for theothers; a second later, all six were reunited.</p><p>These men began to talk in a low voice.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the place,&rdquo; said one of them.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there a <i>cab</i> [dog] in the garden?&rdquo; asked another.</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. In any case, I have fetched a ball that we&rsquo;ll make himeat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you some putty to break the pane with?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The railing is old,&rdquo; interpolated a fifth, who had the voice of aventriloquist.</p><p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said the second who had spoken. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t screechunder the saw, and it won&rsquo;t be hard to cut.&rdquo;</p><p>The sixth, who had not yet opened his lips, now began to inspect the gate,as Éponine had done an hour earlier, grasping each bar in succession, andshaking them cautiously.</p><p>Thus he came to the bar which Marius had loosened. As he was on the pointof grasping this bar, a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness, fell uponhis arm; he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push in the middleof his breast, and a hoarse voice said to him, but not loudly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a dog.&rdquo;</p><p>At the same moment, he perceived a pale girl standing before him.</p><p>The man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings. Hebristled up in hideous wise; nothing is so formidable to behold asferocious beasts who are uneasy; their terrified air evokes terror.</p><p>He recoiled and stammered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What jade is this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your daughter.&rdquo;</p><p>It was, in fact, Éponine, who had addressed Thénardier.</p><p>At the apparition of Éponine, the other five, that is to say, Claquesous,Guelemer, Babet, Brujon, and Montparnasse had noiselessly drawn near,without precipitation, without uttering a word, with the sinister slownesspeculiar to these men of the night.</p><p>Some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands. Guelemerheld one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call <i>fanchons</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, see here, what are you about there? What do you want with us? Are youcrazy?&rdquo; exclaimed Thénardier, as loudly as one can exclaim and still speaklow; &ldquo;what have you come here to hinder our work for?&rdquo;</p><p>Éponine burst out laughing, and threw herself on his neck.</p><p>&ldquo;I am here, little father, because I am here. Isn&rsquo;t a person allowed tosit on the stones nowadays? It&rsquo;s you who ought not to be here. What haveyou come here for, since it&rsquo;s a biscuit? I told Magnon so. There&rsquo;s nothingto be done here. But embrace me, my good little father! It&rsquo;s a long timesince I&rsquo;ve seen you! So you&rsquo;re out?&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier tried to disentangle himself from Éponine&rsquo;s arms, and grumbled:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. You&rsquo;ve embraced me. Yes, I&rsquo;m out. I&rsquo;m not in. Now, get awaywith you.&rdquo;</p><p>But Éponine did not release her hold, and redoubled her caresses.</p><p>&ldquo;But how did you manage it, little pa? You must have been very clever toget out of that. Tell me about it! And my mother? Where is mother? Tell meabout mamma.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s well. I don&rsquo;t know, let me alone, and be off, I tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go, so there now,&rdquo; pouted Éponine like a spoiled child; &ldquo;you sendme off, and it&rsquo;s four months since I saw you, and I&rsquo;ve hardly had time tokiss you.&rdquo;</p><p>And she caught her father round the neck again.</p><p>&ldquo;Come, now, this is stupid!&rdquo; said Babet.</p><p>&ldquo;Make haste!&rdquo; said Guelemer, &ldquo;the cops may pass.&rdquo;</p><p>The ventriloquist&rsquo;s voice repeated his distich:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Nous n&rsquo; sommes pas le jour de l&rsquo;an,<br/>A bécoter papa, maman.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t New Year&rsquo;s day<br/>To peck at pa and ma.&rdquo;</p><p>Éponine turned to the five ruffians.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Monsieur Brujon. Good day, Monsieur Babet. Good day, MonsieurClaquesous. Don&rsquo;t you know me, Monsieur Guelemer? How goes it,Montparnasse?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, they know you!&rdquo; ejaculated Thénardier. &ldquo;But good day, good evening,sheer off! leave us alone!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the hour for foxes, not for chickens,&rdquo; said Montparnasse.</p><p>&ldquo;You see the job we have on hand here,&rdquo; added Babet.</p><p>Éponine caught Montparnasse&rsquo;s hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll cut yourself, I&rsquo;ve a knife open.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My little Montparnasse,&rdquo; responded Éponine very gently, &ldquo;you must haveconfidence in people. I am the daughter of my father, perhaps. MonsieurBabet, Monsieur Guelemer, I&rsquo;m the person who was charged to investigatethis matter.&rdquo;</p><p>It is remarkable that Éponine did not talk slang. That frightful tonguehad become impossible to her since she had known Marius.</p><p>She pressed in her hand, small, bony, and feeble as that of a skeleton,Guelemer&rsquo;s huge, coarse fingers, and continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You know well that I&rsquo;m no fool. Ordinarily, I am believed. I haverendered you service on various occasions. Well, I have made inquiries;you will expose yourselves to no purpose, you see. I swear to you thatthere is nothing in this house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are lone women,&rdquo; said Guelemer.</p><p>&ldquo;No, the persons have moved away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The candles haven&rsquo;t, anyway!&rdquo; ejaculated Babet.</p><p>And he pointed out to Éponine, across the tops of the trees, a light whichwas wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion. It was Toussaint,who had stayed up to spread out some linen to dry.</p><p>Éponine made a final effort.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re very poor folks, and it&rsquo;s a hovel where thereisn&rsquo;t a sou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go to the devil!&rdquo; cried Thénardier. &ldquo;When we&rsquo;ve turned the house upsidedown and put the cellar at the top and the attic below, we&rsquo;ll tell youwhat there is inside, and whether it&rsquo;s francs or sous or half-farthings.&rdquo;</p><p>And he pushed her aside with the intention of entering.</p><p>&ldquo;My good friend, Mr. Montparnasse,&rdquo; said Éponine, &ldquo;I entreat you, you area good fellow, don&rsquo;t enter.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take care, you&rsquo;ll cut yourself,&rdquo; replied Montparnasse.</p><p>Thénardier resumed in his decided tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Decamp, my girl, and leave men to their own affairs!&rdquo;</p><p>Éponine released Montparnasse&rsquo;s hand, which she had grasped again, andsaid:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;So you mean to enter this house?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; grinned the ventriloquist.</p><p>Then she set her back against the gate, faced the six ruffians who werearmed to the teeth, and to whom the night lent the visages of demons, andsaid in a firm, low voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mean that you shall.&rdquo;</p><p>They halted in amazement. The ventriloquist, however, finished his grin.She went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Friends! Listen well. This is not what you want. Now I&rsquo;m talking. In thefirst place, if you enter this garden, if you lay a hand on this gate,I&rsquo;ll scream, I&rsquo;ll beat on the door, I&rsquo;ll rouse everybody, I&rsquo;ll have thewhole six of you seized, I&rsquo;ll call the police.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d do it, too,&rdquo; said Thénardier in a low tone to Brujon and theventriloquist.</p><p>She shook her head and added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Beginning with my father!&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier stepped nearer.</p><p>&ldquo;Not so close, my good man!&rdquo; said she.</p><p>He retreated, growling between his teeth:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo;</p><p>And he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Bitch!&rdquo;</p><p>She began to laugh in a terrible way:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;As you like, but you shall not enter here. I&rsquo;m not the daughter of a dog,since I&rsquo;m the daughter of a wolf. There are six of you, what matters thatto me? You are men. Well, I&rsquo;m a woman. You don&rsquo;t frighten me. I tell youthat you shan&rsquo;t enter this house, because it doesn&rsquo;t suit me. If youapproach, I&rsquo;ll bark. I told you, I&rsquo;m the dog, and I don&rsquo;t care a straw foryou. Go your way, you bore me! Go where you please, but don&rsquo;t come here, Iforbid it! You can use your knives. I&rsquo;ll use kicks; it&rsquo;s all the same tome, come on!&rdquo;</p><p>She advanced a pace nearer the ruffians, she was terrible, she burst outlaughing:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardine! I&rsquo;m not afraid. I shall be hungry this summer, and I shall becold this winter. Aren&rsquo;t they ridiculous, these ninnies of men, to thinkthey can scare a girl! What! Scare? Oh, yes, much! Because you havefinical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put on a bigvoice, forsooth! I ain&rsquo;t afraid of anything, that I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p><p>She fastened her intent gaze upon Thénardier and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Not even of you, father!&rdquo;</p><p>Then she continued, as she cast her blood-shot, spectre-like eyes upon theruffians in turn:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What do I care if I&rsquo;m picked up to-morrow morning on the pavement of theRue Plumet, killed by the blows of my father&rsquo;s club, or whether I&rsquo;m founda year from now in the nets at Saint-Cloud or the Isle of Swans in themidst of rotten old corks and drowned dogs?&rdquo;</p><p>She was forced to pause; she was seized by a dry cough, her breath camefrom her weak and narrow chest like the death-rattle.</p><p>She resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have only to cry out, and people will come, and then slap, bang! Thereare six of you; I represent the whole world.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier made a movement towards her.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t approach!&rdquo; she cried.</p><p>He halted, and said gently:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, no; I won&rsquo;t approach, but don&rsquo;t speak so loud. So you intend tohinder us in our work, my daughter? But we must earn our living all thesame. Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You bother me,&rdquo; said Éponine.</p><p>&ldquo;But we must live, we must eat&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Burst!&rdquo;</p><p>So saying, she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence and hummed:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Mon bras si dodu,<br/>Ma jambe bien faite<br/>Et le temps perdu.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;My arm so plump,<br/>My leg well formed,<br/>And time wasted.&rdquo;</p><p>She had set her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand, and she swungher foot with an air of indifference. Her tattered gown permitted a viewof her thin shoulder-blades. The neighboring street lantern illuminatedher profile and her attitude. Nothing more resolute and more surprisingcould be seen.</p><p>The six rascals, speechless and gloomy at being held in check by a girl,retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern, and held counsel withfurious and humiliated shrugs.</p><p>In the meantime she stared at them with a stern but peaceful air.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something the matter with her,&rdquo; said Babet. &ldquo;A reason. Is she inlove with the dog? It&rsquo;s a shame to miss this, anyway. Two women, an oldfellow who lodges in the back-yard, and curtains that ain&rsquo;t so bad at thewindows. The old cove must be a Jew. I think the job&rsquo;s a good one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, go in, then, the rest of you,&rdquo; exclaimed Montparnasse. &ldquo;Do the job.I&rsquo;ll stay here with the girl, and if she fails us&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>He flashed the knife, which he held open in his hand, in the light of thelantern.</p><p>Thénardier said not a word, and seemed ready for whatever the restpleased.</p><p>Brujon, who was somewhat of an oracle, and who had, as the reader knows,&ldquo;put up the job,&rdquo; had not as yet spoken. He seemed thoughtful. He had thereputation of not sticking at anything, and it was known that he hadplundered a police post simply out of bravado. Besides this he made versesand songs, which gave him great authority.</p><p>Babet interrogated him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You say nothing, Brujon?&rdquo;</p><p>Brujon remained silent an instant longer, then he shook his head invarious ways, and finally concluded to speak:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;See here; this morning I came across two sparrows fighting, this eveningI jostled a woman who was quarrelling. All that&rsquo;s bad. Let&rsquo;s quit.&rdquo;</p><p>They went away.</p><p>As they went, Montparnasse muttered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind! if they had wanted, I&rsquo;d have cut her throat.&rdquo;</p><p>Babet responded</p><p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t hit a lady.&rdquo;</p><p>At the corner of the street they halted and exchanged the followingenigmatical dialogue in a low tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Where shall we go to sleep to-night?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Under Pantin [Paris].&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you the key to the gate, Thénardier?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardi.&rdquo;</p><p>Éponine, who never took her eyes off of them, saw them retreat by the roadby which they had come. She rose and began to creep after them along thewalls and the houses. She followed them thus as far as the boulevard.</p><p>There they parted, and she saw these six men plunge into the gloom, wherethey appeared to melt away.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0260" id="link2HCH0260"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;THINGS OF THE NIGHT</h3><p>After the departure of the ruffians, the Rue Plumet resumed its tranquil,nocturnal aspect. That which had just taken place in this street would nothave astonished a forest. The lofty trees, the copses, the heaths, thebranches rudely interlaced, the tall grass, exist in a sombre manner; thesavage swarming there catches glimpses of sudden apparitions of theinvisible; that which is below man distinguishes, through the mists, thatwhich is beyond man; and the things of which we living beings are ignorantthere meet face to face in the night. Nature, bristling and wild, takesalarm at certain approaches in which she fancies that she feels thesupernatural. The forces of the gloom know each other, and are strangelybalanced by each other. Teeth and claws fear what they cannot grasp.Blood-drinking bestiality, voracious appetites, hunger in search of prey,the armed instincts of nails and jaws which have for source and aim thebelly, glare and smell out uneasily the impassive spectral forms strayingbeneath a shroud, erect in its vague and shuddering robe, and which seemto them to live with a dead and terrible life. These brutalities, whichare only matter, entertain a confused fear of having to deal with theimmense obscurity condensed into an unknown being. A black figure barringthe way stops the wild beast short. That which emerges from the cemeteryintimidates and disconcerts that which emerges from the cave; theferocious fear the sinister; wolves recoil when they encounter a ghoul.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0261" id="link2HCH0261"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;MARIUS BECOMES PRACTICAL ONCE MORE TO THE EXTENT OFGIVING COSETTE HIS ADDRESS</h3><p>While this sort of a dog with a human face was mounting guard over thegate, and while the six ruffians were yielding to a girl, Marius was byCosette&rsquo;s side.</p><p>Never had the sky been more studded with stars and more charming, thetrees more trembling, the odor of the grass more penetrating; never hadthe birds fallen asleep among the leaves with a sweeter noise; never hadall the harmonies of universal serenity responded more thoroughly to theinward music of love; never had Marius been more captivated, more happy,more ecstatic.</p><p>But he had found Cosette sad; Cosette had been weeping. Her eyes were red.</p><p>This was the first cloud in that wonderful dream.</p><p>Marius&rsquo; first word had been: &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;</p><p>And she had replied: &ldquo;This.&rdquo;</p><p>Then she had seated herself on the bench near the steps, and while hetremblingly took his place beside her, she had continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness, because hehas business, and we may go away from here.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius shivered from head to foot.</p><p>When one is at the end of one&rsquo;s life, to die means to go away; when one isat the beginning of it, to go away means to die.</p><p>For the last six weeks, Marius had little by little, slowly, by degrees,taken possession of Cosette each day. As we have already explained, in thecase of first love, the soul is taken long before the body; later on, onetakes the body long before the soul; sometimes one does not take the soulat all; the Faublas and the Prudhommes add: &ldquo;Because there is none&rdquo;; butthe sarcasm is, fortunately, a blasphemy. So Marius possessed Cosette, asspirits possess, but he enveloped her with all his soul, and seized herjealously with incredible conviction. He possessed her smile, her breath,her perfume, the profound radiance of her blue eyes, the sweetness of herskin when he touched her hand, the charming mark which she had on herneck, all her thoughts. Therefore, he possessed all Cosette&rsquo;s dreams.</p><p>He incessantly gazed at, and he sometimes touched lightly with his breath,the short locks on the nape of her neck, and he declared to himself thatthere was not one of those short hairs which did not belong to him,Marius. He gazed upon and adored the things that she wore, her knot ofribbon, her gloves, her sleeves, her shoes, her cuffs, as sacred objectsof which he was the master. He dreamed that he was the lord of thosepretty shell combs which she wore in her hair, and he even said tohimself, in confused and suppressed stammerings of voluptuousness whichdid not make their way to the light, that there was not a ribbon of hergown, not a mesh in her stockings, not a fold in her bodice, which was nothis. Beside Cosette he felt himself beside his own property, his ownthing, his own despot and his slave. It seemed as though they had sointermingled their souls, that it would have been impossible to tell themapart had they wished to take them back again.&mdash;&ldquo;This is mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,it is mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;I assure you that you are mistaken. This is my property.&rdquo; &ldquo;What you are taking as your own is myself.&rdquo;&mdash;Marius was somethingthat made a part of Cosette, and Cosette was something which made a partof Marius. Marius felt Cosette within him. To have Cosette, to possessCosette, this, to him, was not to be distinguished from breathing. It wasin the midst of this faith, of this intoxication, of this virginpossession, unprecedented and absolute, of this sovereignty, that thesewords: &ldquo;We are going away,&rdquo; fell suddenly, at a blow, and that the harshvoice of reality cried to him: &ldquo;Cosette is not yours!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius awoke. For six weeks Marius had been living, as we have said,outside of life; those words, <i>going away!</i> caused him to re-enter itharshly.</p><p>He found not a word to say. Cosette merely felt that his hand was verycold. She said to him in her turn: &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;</p><p>He replied in so low a tone that Cosette hardly heard him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I did not understand what you said.&rdquo;</p><p>She began again:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;This morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and tohold myself in readiness, that he would give me his linen to put in atrunk, that he was obliged to go on a journey, that we were to go away,that it is necessary to have a large trunk for me and a small one for him,and that all is to be ready in a week from now, and that we might go toEngland.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But this is outrageous!&rdquo; exclaimed Marius.</p><p>It is certain, that, at that moment, no abuse of power, no violence, notone of the abominations of the worst tyrants, no action of Busiris, ofTiberius, or of Henry VIII., could have equalled this in atrocity, in theopinion of Marius; M. Fauchelevent taking his daughter off to Englandbecause he had business there.</p><p>He demanded in a weak voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And when do you start?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He did not say when.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And when shall you return?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He did not say when.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius rose and said coldly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette, shall you go?&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette turned toward him her beautiful eyes, all filled with anguish, andreplied in a sort of bewilderment:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To England. Shall you go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you say <i>you</i> to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I ask you whether you will go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you expect me to do?&rdquo; she said, clasping her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;So, you will go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If my father goes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So, you will go?&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette took Marius&rsquo; hand, and pressed it without replying.</p><p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Marius, &ldquo;then I will go elsewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words. She turnedso pale that her face shone white through the gloom. She stammered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius looked at her, then raised his eyes to heaven, and answered:&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>When his eyes fell again, he saw Cosette smiling at him. The smile of awoman whom one loves possesses a visible radiance, even at night.</p><p>&ldquo;How silly we are! Marius, I have an idea.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If we go away, do you go too! I will tell you where! Come and join mewherever I am.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius was now a thoroughly roused man. He had fallen back into reality.He cried to Cosette:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Go away with you! Are you mad? Why, I should have to have money, and Ihave none! Go to England? But I am in debt now, I owe, I don&rsquo;t know howmuch, more than ten louis to Courfeyrac, one of my friends with whom youare not acquainted! I have an old hat which is not worth three francs, Ihave a coat which lacks buttons in front, my shirt is all ragged, myelbows are torn, my boots let in the water; for the last six weeks I havenot thought about it, and I have not told you about it. You only see me atnight, and you give me your love; if you were to see me in the daytime,you would give me a sou! Go to England! Eh! I haven&rsquo;t enough to pay for apassport!&rdquo;</p><p>He threw himself against a tree which was close at hand, erect, his browpressed close to the bark, feeling neither the wood which flayed his skin,nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples, and there he stoodmotionless, on the point of falling, like the statue of despair.</p><p>He remained a long time thus. One could remain for eternity in suchabysses. At last he turned round. He heard behind him a faint stiflednoise, which was sweet yet sad.</p><p>It was Cosette sobbing.</p><p>She had been weeping for more than two hours beside Marius as hemeditated.</p><p>He came to her, fell at her knees, and slowly prostrating himself, he tookthe tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe, and kissed it.</p><p>She let him have his way in silence. There are moments when a womanaccepts, like a sombre and resigned goddess, the religion of love.</p><p>&ldquo;Do not weep,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>She murmured:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Not when I may be going away, and you cannot come!&rdquo;</p><p>He went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo;</p><p>She replied, sobbing, by that word from paradise which is never morecharming than amid tears:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I adore you!&rdquo;</p><p>He continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do not weep. Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo; said she.</p><p>He took her hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette, I have never given my word of honor to any one, because my wordof honor terrifies me. I feel that my father is by my side. Well, I giveyou my most sacred word of honor, that if you go away I shall die.&rdquo;</p><p>In the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy sosolemn and so tranquil, that Cosette trembled. She felt that chill whichis produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by. The shock made hercease weeping.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, listen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do not expect me to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do not expect me until the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will see.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A day without seeing you! But that is impossible!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives, perhaps.&rdquo;</p><p>And Marius added in a low tone and in an aside:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;He is a man who never changes his habits, and he has never received anyone except in the evening.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of what man are you speaking?&rdquo; asked Cosette.</p><p>&ldquo;I? I said nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you hope, then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait until the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You wish it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Cosette.&rdquo;</p><p>She took his head in both her hands, raising herself on tiptoe in order tobe on a level with him, and tried to read his hope in his eyes.</p><p>Marius resumed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Now that I think of it, you ought to know my address: something mighthappen, one never knows; I live with that friend named Courfeyrac, Rue dela Verrerie, No. 16.&rdquo;</p><p>He searched in his pocket, pulled out his penknife, and with the blade hewrote on the plaster of the wall:&mdash;</p><p><i>&ldquo;16 Rue de la Verrerie.&rdquo;</i></p><p>In the meantime, Cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more.</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me your thought, Marius; you have some idea. Tell it to me. Oh! tellme, so that I may pass a pleasant night.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is my idea: that it is impossible that God should mean to part us.Wait; expect me the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What shall I do until then?&rdquo; said Cosette. &ldquo;You are outside, you go, andcome! How happy men are! I shall remain entirely alone! Oh! How sad Ishall be! What is it that you are going to do to-morrow evening? tell me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am going to try something.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I will pray to God and I will think of you here, so that you may besuccessful. I will question you no further, since you do not wish it. Youare my master. I shall pass the evening to-morrow in singing that musicfrom <i>Euryanthe</i> that you love, and that you came one evening to listen to,outside my shutters. But day after to-morrow you will come early. I shallexpect you at dusk, at nine o&rsquo;clock precisely, I warn you. Mon Dieu! howsad it is that the days are so long! On the stroke of nine, do youunderstand, I shall be in the garden.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I also.&rdquo;</p><p>And without having uttered it, moved by the same thought, impelled bythose electric currents which place lovers in continual communication,both being intoxicated with delight even in their sorrow, they fell intoeach other&rsquo;s arms, without perceiving that their lips met while theiruplifted eyes, overflowing with rapture and full of tears, gazed upon thestars.</p><p>When Marius went forth, the street was deserted. This was the moment whenÉponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard.</p><p>While Marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree, an ideahad crossed his mind; an idea, alas! that he himself judged to besenseless and impossible. He had come to a desperate decision.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0262" id="link2HCH0262"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE OLD HEART AND THE YOUNG HEART IN THE PRESENCE OFEACH OTHER</h3><p>At that epoch, Father Gillenormand was well past his ninety-firstbirthday. He still lived with Mademoiselle Gillenormand in the Rue desFilles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the old house which he owned. He was, as thereader will remember, one of those antique old men who await deathperfectly erect, whom age bears down without bending, and whom even sorrowcannot curve.</p><p>Still, his daughter had been saying for some time: &ldquo;My father is sinking.&rdquo; He no longer boxed the maids&rsquo; ears; he no longer thumped the landing-placeso vigorously with his cane when Basque was slow in opening the door. TheRevolution of July had exasperated him for the space of barely six months.He had viewed, almost tranquilly, that coupling of words, in the <i>Moniteur:</i>M. Humblot-Conté, peer of France. The fact is, that the old man was deeplydejected. He did not bend, he did not yield; this was no more acharacteristic of his physical than of his moral nature, but he felthimself giving way internally. For four years he had been waiting forMarius, with his foot firmly planted, that is the exact word, in theconviction that that good-for-nothing young scamp would ring at his doorsome day or other; now he had reached the point, where, at certain gloomyhours, he said to himself, that if Marius made him wait much longer&mdash;Itwas not death that was insupportable to him; it was the idea that perhapshe should never see Marius again. The idea of never seeing Marius againhad never entered his brain until that day; now the thought began to recurto him, and it chilled him. Absence, as is always the case in genuine andnatural sentiments, had only served to augment the grandfather&rsquo;s love forthe ungrateful child, who had gone off like a flash. It is during Decembernights, when the cold stands at ten degrees, that one thinks oftenest ofthe son.</p><p>M. Gillenormand was, or thought himself, above all things, incapable oftaking a single step, he&mdash;the grandfather, towards his grandson; &ldquo;Iwould die rather,&rdquo; he said to himself. He did not consider himself as theleast to blame; but he thought of Marius only with profound tenderness,and the mute despair of an elderly, kindly old man who is about to vanishin the dark.</p><p>He began to lose his teeth, which added to his sadness.</p><p>M. Gillenormand, without however acknowledging it to himself, for it wouldhave rendered him furious and ashamed, had never loved a mistress as heloved Marius.</p><p>He had had placed in his chamber, opposite the head of his bed, so that itshould be the first thing on which his eyes fell on waking, an oldportrait of his other daughter, who was dead, Madame Pontmercy, a portraitwhich had been taken when she was eighteen. He gazed incessantly at thatportrait. One day, he happened to say, as he gazed upon it:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I think the likeness is strong.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To my sister?&rdquo; inquired Mademoiselle Gillenormand. &ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;</p><p>The old man added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And to him also.&rdquo;</p><p>Once as he sat with his knees pressed together, and his eyes almostclosed, in a despondent attitude, his daughter ventured to say to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Father, are you as angry with him as ever?&rdquo;</p><p>She paused, not daring to proceed further.</p><p>&ldquo;With whom?&rdquo; he demanded.</p><p>&ldquo;With that poor Marius.&rdquo;</p><p>He raised his aged head, laid his withered and emaciated fist on thetable, and exclaimed in his most irritated and vibrating tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Poor Marius, do you say! That gentleman is a knave, a wretched scoundrel,a vain little ingrate, a heartless, soulless, haughty, and wicked man!&rdquo;</p><p>And he turned away so that his daughter might not see the tear that stoodin his eye.</p><p>Three days later he broke a silence which had lasted four hours, to say tohis daughter point-blank:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I had the honor to ask Mademoiselle Gillenormand never to mention him tome.&rdquo;</p><p>Aunt Gillenormand renounced every effort, and pronounced this acutediagnosis: &ldquo;My father never cared very much for my sister after her folly.It is clear that he detests Marius.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After her folly&rdquo; meant: &ldquo;after she had married the colonel.&rdquo;</p><p>However, as the reader has been able to conjecture, MademoiselleGillenormand had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite, theofficer of lancers, for Marius. The substitute, Théodule, had not been asuccess. M. Gillenormand had not accepted the <i>quid pro quo</i>. A vacancy inthe heart does not accommodate itself to a stop-gap. Théodule, on hisside, though he scented the inheritance, was disgusted at the task ofpleasing. The goodman bored the lancer; and the lancer shocked thegoodman. Lieutenant Théodule was gay, no doubt, but a chatter-box,frivolous, but vulgar; a high liver, but a frequenter of bad company; hehad mistresses, it is true, and he had a great deal to say about them, itis true also; but he talked badly. All his good qualities had a defect. M.Gillenormand was worn out with hearing him tell about the love affairsthat he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the Rue de Babylone. Andthen, Lieutenant Gillenormand sometimes came in his uniform, with thetricolored cockade. This rendered him downright intolerable. Finally,Father Gillenormand had said to his daughter: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of thatThéodule. I haven&rsquo;t much taste for warriors in time of peace. Receive himif you choose. I don&rsquo;t know but I prefer slashers to fellows that dragtheir swords. The clash of blades in battle is less dismal, after all,than the clank of the scabbard on the pavement. And then, throwing outyour chest like a bully and lacing yourself like a girl, with stays underyour cuirass, is doubly ridiculous. When one is a veritable man, one holdsequally aloof from swagger and from affected airs. He is neither ablusterer nor a finnicky-hearted man. Keep your Théodule for yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>It was in vain that his daughter said to him: &ldquo;But he is your grandnephew,nevertheless,&rdquo;&mdash;it turned out that M. Gillenormand, who was agrandfather to the very finger-tips, was not in the least a grand-uncle.</p><p>In fact, as he had good sense, and as he had compared the two, Théodulehad only served to make him regret Marius all the more.</p><p>One evening,&mdash;it was the 24th of June, which did not prevent FatherGillenormand having a rousing fire on the hearth,&mdash;he had dismissedhis daughter, who was sewing in a neighboring apartment. He was alone inhis chamber, amid its pastoral scenes, with his feet propped on theandirons, half enveloped in his huge screen of coromandel lacquer, withits nine leaves, with his elbow resting on a table where burned twocandles under a green shade, engulfed in his tapestry armchair, and in hishand a book which he was not reading. He was dressed, according to hiswont, like an <i>incroyable</i>, and resembled an antique portrait by Garat. Thiswould have made people run after him in the street, had not his daughtercovered him up, whenever he went out, in a vast bishop&rsquo;s wadded cloak,which concealed his attire. At home, he never wore a dressing gown, exceptwhen he rose and retired. &ldquo;It gives one a look of age,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Father Gillenormand was thinking of Marius lovingly and bitterly; and, asusual, bitterness predominated. His tenderness once soured always ended byboiling and turning to indignation. He had reached the point where a mantries to make up his mind and to accept that which rends his heart. He wasexplaining to himself that there was no longer any reason why Mariusshould return, that if he intended to return, he should have done it longago, that he must renounce the idea. He was trying to accustom himself tothe thought that all was over, and that he should die without havingbeheld &ldquo;that gentleman&rdquo; again. But his whole nature revolted; his agedpaternity would not consent to this. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said he,&mdash;this was hisdoleful refrain,&mdash;&ldquo;he will not return!&rdquo; His bald head had fallen uponhis breast, and he fixed a melancholy and irritated gaze upon the ashes onhis hearth.</p><p>In the very midst of his reverie, his old servant Basque entered, andinquired:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Can Monsieur receive M. Marius?&rdquo;</p><p>The old man sat up erect, pallid, and like a corpse which rises under theinfluence of a galvanic shock. All his blood had retreated to his heart.He stammered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;M. Marius what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Basque, intimidated and put out of countenance byhis master&rsquo;s air; &ldquo;I have not seen him. Nicolette came in and said to me:‘There&rsquo;s a young man here; say that it is M. Marius.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Father Gillenormand stammered in a low voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Show him in.&rdquo;</p><p>And he remained in the same attitude, with shaking head, and his eyesfixed on the door. It opened once more. A young man entered. It wasMarius.</p><p>Marius halted at the door, as though waiting to be bidden to enter.</p><p>His almost squalid attire was not perceptible in the obscurity caused bythe shade. Nothing could be seen but his calm, grave, but strangely sadface.</p><p>It was several minutes before Father Gillenormand, dulled with amazementand joy, could see anything except a brightness as when one is in thepresence of an apparition. He was on the point of swooning; he saw Mariusthrough a dazzling light. It certainly was he, it certainly was Marius.</p><p>At last! After the lapse of four years! He grasped him entire, so tospeak, in a single glance. He found him noble, handsome, distinguished,well-grown, a complete man, with a suitable mien and a charming air. Hefelt a desire to open his arms, to call him, to fling himself forward; hisheart melted with rapture, affectionate words swelled and overflowed hisbreast; at length all his tenderness came to the light and reached hislips, and, by a contrast which constituted the very foundation of hisnature, what came forth was harshness. He said abruptly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What have you come here for?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius replied with embarrassment:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>M. Gillenormand would have liked to have Marius throw himself into hisarms. He was displeased with Marius and with himself. He was consciousthat he was brusque, and that Marius was cold. It caused the goodmanunendurable and irritating anxiety to feel so tender and forlorn within,and only to be able to be hard outside. Bitterness returned. Heinterrupted Marius in a peevish tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why did you come?&rdquo;</p><p>That &ldquo;then&rdquo; signified: <i>If you do not come to embrace me</i>. Marius looked athis grandfather, whose pallor gave him a face of marble.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you come to beg my pardon? Do you acknowledge your faults?&rdquo;</p><p>He thought he was putting Marius on the right road, and that &ldquo;the child&rdquo; would yield. Marius shivered; it was the denial of his father that wasrequired of him; he dropped his eyes and replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; exclaimed the old man impetuously, with a grief that was poignantand full of wrath, &ldquo;what do you want of me?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius clasped his hands, advanced a step, and said in a feeble andtrembling voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir, have pity on me.&rdquo;</p><p>These words touched M. Gillenormand; uttered a little sooner, they wouldhave rendered him tender, but they came too late. The grandfather rose; hesupported himself with both hands on his cane; his lips were white, hisbrow wavered, but his lofty form towered above Marius as he bowed.</p><p>&ldquo;Pity on you, sir! It is youth demanding pity of the old man ofninety-one! You are entering into life, I am leaving it; you go to theplay, to balls, to the café, to the billiard-hall; you have wit, youplease the women, you are a handsome fellow; as for me, I spit on mybrands in the heart of summer; you are rich with the only riches that arereally such, I possess all the poverty of age; infirmity, isolation! Youhave your thirty-two teeth, a good digestion, bright eyes, strength,appetite, health, gayety, a forest of black hair; I have no longer evenwhite hair, I have lost my teeth, I am losing my legs, I am losing mymemory; there are three names of streets that I confound incessantly, theRue Charlot, the Rue du Chaume, and the Rue Saint-Claude, that is what Ihave come to; you have before you the whole future, full of sunshine, andI am beginning to lose my sight, so far am I advancing into the night; youare in love, that is a matter of course, I am beloved by no one in all theworld; and you ask pity of me! Parbleu! Molière forgot that. If that isthe way you jest at the courthouse, Messieurs the lawyers, I sincerelycompliment you. You are droll.&rdquo;</p><p>And the octogenarian went on in a grave and angry voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Come, now, what do you want of me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Marius, &ldquo;I know that my presence is displeasing to you, but Ihave come merely to ask one thing of you, and then I shall go awayimmediately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are a fool!&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Who said that you were to go away?&rdquo;</p><p>This was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom ofhis heart:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ask my pardon! Throw yourself on my neck!&rdquo;</p><p>M. Gillenormand felt that Marius would leave him in a few moments, thathis harsh reception had repelled the lad, that his hardness was drivinghim away; he said all this to himself, and it augmented his grief; and ashis grief was straightway converted into wrath, it increased hisharshness. He would have liked to have Marius understand, and Marius didnot understand, which made the goodman furious.</p><p>He began again:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What! you deserted me, your grandfather, you left my house to go no oneknows whither, you drove your aunt to despair, you went off, it is easilyguessed, to lead a bachelor life; it&rsquo;s more convenient, to play the dandy,to come in at all hours, to amuse yourself; you have given me no signs oflife, you have contracted debts without even telling me to pay them, youhave become a smasher of windows and a blusterer, and, at the end of fouryears, you come to me, and that is all you have to say to me!&rdquo;</p><p>This violent fashion of driving a grandson to tenderness was productiveonly of silence on the part of Marius. M. Gillenormand folded his arms; agesture which with him was peculiarly imperious, and apostrophized Mariusbitterly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us make an end of this. You have come to ask something of me, yousay? Well, what? What is it? Speak!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Marius, with the look of a man who feels that he is fallingover a precipice, &ldquo;I have come to ask your permission to marry.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Gillenormand rang the bell. Basque opened the door half-way.</p><p>&ldquo;Call my daughter.&rdquo;</p><p>A second later, the door was opened once more, Mademoiselle Gillenormanddid not enter, but showed herself; Marius was standing, mute, with pendantarms and the face of a criminal; M. Gillenormand was pacing back and forthin the room. He turned to his daughter and said to her:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing. It is Monsieur Marius. Say good day to him. Monsieur wishes tomarry. That&rsquo;s all. Go away.&rdquo;</p><p>The curt, hoarse sound of the old man&rsquo;s voice announced a strange degreeof excitement. The aunt gazed at Marius with a frightened air, hardlyappeared to recognize him, did not allow a gesture or a syllable to escapeher, and disappeared at her father&rsquo;s breath more swiftly than a strawbefore the hurricane.</p><p>In the meantime, Father Gillenormand had returned and placed his backagainst the chimney-piece once more.</p><p>&ldquo;You marry! At one and twenty! You have arranged that! You have only apermission to ask! a formality. Sit down, sir. Well, you have had arevolution since I had the honor to see you last. The Jacobins got theupper hand. You must have been delighted. Are you not a Republican sinceyou are a Baron? You can make that agree. The Republic makes a good saucefor the barony. Are you one of those decorated by July? Have you taken theLouvre at all, sir? Quite near here, in the Rue Saint-Antoine, oppositethe Rue des Nonamdières, there is a cannon-ball incrusted in the wall ofthe third story of a house with this inscription: &lsquo;July 28th, 1830.&rsquo; Gotake a look at that. It produces a good effect. Ah! those friends of yoursdo pretty things. By the way, aren&rsquo;t they erecting a fountain in the placeof the monument of M. le Duc de Berry? So you want to marry? Whom? Can oneinquire without indiscretion?&rdquo;</p><p>He paused, and, before Marius had time to answer, he added violently:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Come now, you have a profession? A fortune made? How much do you earn atyour trade of lawyer?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Marius, with a sort of firmness and resolution that wasalmost fierce.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing? Then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred livresthat I allow you?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius did not reply. M. Gillenormand continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Then I understand the girl is rich?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As rich as I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What! No dowry?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Expectations?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Utterly naked! What&rsquo;s the father?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s her name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Fauchelevent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fauchewhat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fauchelevent.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pttt!&rdquo; ejaculated the old gentleman.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Marius.</p><p>M. Gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speaking tohimself:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, one and twenty years of age, no profession, twelve hundredlivres a year, Madame la Baronne de Pontmercy will go and purchase acouple of sous&rsquo; worth of parsley from the fruiterer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; repeated Marius, in the despair at the last hope, which wasvanishing, &ldquo;I entreat you! I conjure you in the name of Heaven, withclasped hands, sir, I throw myself at your feet, permit me to marry her!&rdquo;</p><p>The old man burst into a shout of strident and mournful laughter, coughingand laughing at the same time.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! ah! ah! You said to yourself: &lsquo;Pardine! I&rsquo;ll go hunt up that oldblockhead, that absurd numskull! What a shame that I&rsquo;m not twenty-five!How I&rsquo;d treat him to a nice respectful summons! How nicely I&rsquo;d get alongwithout him! It&rsquo;s nothing to me, I&rsquo;d say to him: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only too happy tosee me, you old idiot, I want to marry, I desire to wed MamselleNo-matter-whom, daughter of Monsieur No-matter-what, I have no shoes, shehas no chemise, that just suits; I want to throw my career, my future, myyouth, my life to the dogs; I wish to take a plunge into wretchedness witha woman around my neck, that&rsquo;s an idea, and you must consent to it!&rdquo; andthe old fossil will consent.&rsquo; Go, my lad, do as you like, attach yourpaving-stone, marry your Pousselevent, your Coupelevent&mdash;Never, sir,never!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p><p>At the tone in which that &ldquo;never&rdquo; was uttered, Marius lost all hope. Hetraversed the chamber with slow steps, with bowed head, tottering and morelike a dying man than like one merely taking his departure. M.Gillenormand followed him with his eyes, and at the moment when the dooropened, and Marius was on the point of going out, he advanced four paces,with the senile vivacity of impetuous and spoiled old gentlemen, seizedMarius by the collar, brought him back energetically into the room, flunghim into an armchair and said to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me all about it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was that single word &ldquo;father&rdquo; which had effected this revolution.</p><p>Marius stared at him in bewilderment. M. Gillenormand&rsquo;s mobile face was nolonger expressive of anything but rough and ineffable good-nature. Thegrandsire had given way before the grandfather.</p><p>&ldquo;Come, see here, speak, tell me about your love affairs, jabber, tell meeverything! Sapristi! how stupid young folks are!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father&mdash;&rdquo; repeated Marius.</p><p>The old man&rsquo;s entire countenance lighted up with indescribable radiance.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right, call me father, and you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p><p>There was now something so kind, so gentle, so openhearted, and sopaternal in this brusqueness, that Marius, in the sudden transition fromdiscouragement to hope, was stunned and intoxicated by it, as it were. Hewas seated near the table, the light from the candles brought out thedilapidation of his costume, which Father Gillenormand regarded withamazement.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, father&mdash;&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, by the way,&rdquo; interrupted M. Gillenormand, &ldquo;you really have not apenny then? You are dressed like a pickpocket.&rdquo;</p><p>He rummaged in a drawer, drew forth a purse, which he laid on the table:&ldquo;Here are a hundred louis, buy yourself a hat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; pursued Marius, &ldquo;my good father, if you only knew! I love her.You cannot imagine it; the first time I saw her was at the Luxembourg, shecame there; in the beginning, I did not pay much heed to her, and then, Idon&rsquo;t know how it came about, I fell in love with her. Oh! how unhappythat made me! Now, at last, I see her every day, at her own home, herfather does not know it, just fancy, they are going away, it is in thegarden that we meet, in the evening, her father means to take her toEngland, then I said to myself: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see my grandfather and tellhim all about the affair. I should go mad first, I should die, I shouldfall ill, I should throw myself into the water. I absolutely must marryher, since I should go mad otherwise.&rsquo; This is the whole truth, and I donot think that I have omitted anything. She lives in a garden with an ironfence, in the Rue Plumet. It is in the neighborhood of the Invalides.&rdquo;</p><p>Father Gillenormand had seated himself, with a beaming countenance, besideMarius. As he listened to him and drank in the sound of his voice, heenjoyed at the same time a protracted pinch of snuff. At the words &ldquo;RuePlumet&rdquo; he interrupted his inhalation and allowed the remainder of hissnuff to fall upon his knees.</p><p>&ldquo;The Rue Plumet, the Rue Plumet, did you say?&mdash;Let us see!&mdash;Arethere not barracks in that vicinity?&mdash;Why, yes, that&rsquo;s it. Yourcousin Théodule has spoken to me about it. The lancer, the officer. A gaygirl, my good friend, a gay girl!&mdash;Pardieu, yes, the Rue Plumet. Itis what used to be called the Rue Blomet.&mdash;It all comes back to menow. I have heard of that little girl of the iron railing in the RuePlumet. In a garden, a Pamela. Your taste is not bad. She is said to be avery tidy creature. Between ourselves, I think that simpleton of a lancerhas been courting her a bit. I don&rsquo;t know where he did it. However, that&rsquo;snot to the purpose. Besides, he is not to be believed. He brags, Marius! Ithink it quite proper that a young man like you should be in love. It&rsquo;sthe right thing at your age. I like you better as a lover than as aJacobin. I like you better in love with a petticoat, sapristi! with twentypetticoats, than with M. de Robespierre. For my part, I will do myself thejustice to say, that in the line of <i>sans-culottes</i>, I have never loved anyone but women. Pretty girls are pretty girls, the deuce! There&rsquo;s noobjection to that. As for the little one, she receives you without herfather&rsquo;s knowledge. That&rsquo;s in the established order of things. I have hadadventures of that same sort myself. More than one. Do you know what isdone then? One does not take the matter ferociously; one does notprecipitate himself into the tragic; one does not make one&rsquo;s mind tomarriage and M. le Maire with his scarf. One simply behaves like a fellowof spirit. One shows good sense. Slip along, mortals; don&rsquo;t marry. Youcome and look up your grandfather, who is a good-natured fellow at bottom,and who always has a few rolls of louis in an old drawer; you say to him:‘See here, grandfather.&rsquo; And the grandfather says: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a simplematter. Youth must amuse itself, and old age must wear out. I have beenyoung, you will be old. Come, my boy, you shall pass it on to yourgrandson. Here are two hundred pistoles. Amuse yourself, deuce take it!&rsquo;Nothing better! That&rsquo;s the way the affair should be treated. You don&rsquo;tmarry, but that does no harm. You understand me?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius, petrified and incapable of uttering a syllable, made a sign withhis head that he did not.</p><p>The old man burst out laughing, winked his aged eye, gave him a slap onthe knee, stared him full in the face with a mysterious and beaming air,and said to him, with the tenderest of shrugs of the shoulder:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Booby! make her your mistress.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius turned pale. He had understood nothing of what his grandfather hadjust said. This twaddle about the Rue Blomet, Pamela, the barracks, thelancer, had passed before Marius like a dissolving view. Nothing of allthat could bear any reference to Cosette, who was a lily. The good man waswandering in his mind. But this wandering terminated in words which Mariusdid understand, and which were a mortal insult to Cosette. Those words,&ldquo;make her your mistress,&rdquo; entered the heart of the strict young man like asword.</p><p>He rose, picked up his hat which lay on the floor, and walked to the doorwith a firm, assured step. There he turned round, bowed deeply to hisgrandfather, raised his head erect again, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Five years ago you insulted my father; to-day you have insulted my wife.I ask nothing more of you, sir. Farewell.&rdquo;</p><p>Father Gillenormand, utterly confounded, opened his mouth, extended hisarms, tried to rise, and before he could utter a word, the door closedonce more, and Marius had disappeared.</p><p>The old man remained for several minutes motionless and as though struckby lightning, without the power to speak or breathe, as though a clenchedfist grasped his throat. At last he tore himself from his armchair, ran,so far as a man can run at ninety-one, to the door, opened it, and cried:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo;</p><p>His daughter made her appearance, then the domestics. He began again, witha pitiful rattle: &ldquo;Run after him! Bring him back! What have I done to him?He is mad! He is going away! Ah! my God! Ah! my God! This time he will notcome back!&rdquo;</p><p>He went to the window which looked out on the street, threw it open withhis aged and palsied hands, leaned out more than half-way, while Basqueand Nicolette held him behind, and shouted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Marius! Marius! Marius! Marius!&rdquo;</p><p>But Marius could no longer hear him, for at that moment he was turning thecorner of the Rue Saint-Louis.</p><p>The octogenarian raised his hands to his temples two or three times withan expression of anguish, recoiled tottering, and fell back into anarmchair, pulseless, voiceless, tearless, with quivering head and lipswhich moved with a stupid air, with nothing in his eyes and nothing anylonger in his heart except a gloomy and profound something which resemblednight.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0303" id="link2H_4_0303"></a>BOOK NINTH&mdash;WHITHER ARE THEY GOING?</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0263" id="link2HCH0263"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;JEAN VALJEAN</h3><p>That same day, towards four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, Jean Valjean wassitting alone on the back side of one of the most solitary slopes in theChamp-de-Mars. Either from prudence, or from a desire to meditate, orsimply in consequence of one of those insensible changes of habit whichgradually introduce themselves into the existence of every one, he nowrarely went out with Cosette. He had on his workman&rsquo;s waistcoat, andtrousers of gray linen; and his long-visored cap concealed hiscountenance.</p><p>He was calm and happy now beside Cosette; that which had, for a time,alarmed and troubled him had been dissipated; but for the last week ortwo, anxieties of another nature had come up. One day, while walking onthe boulevard, he had caught sight of Thénardier; thanks to his disguise,Thénardier had not recognized him; but since that day, Jean Valjean hadseen him repeatedly, and he was now certain that Thénardier was prowlingabout in their neighborhood.</p><p>This had been sufficient to make him come to a decision.</p><p>Moreover, Paris was not tranquil: political troubles presented thisinconvenient feature, for any one who had anything to conceal in his life,that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious, and that whileseeking to ferret out a man like Pépin or Morey, they might very readilydiscover a man like Jean Valjean.</p><p>Jean Valjean had made up his mind to quit Paris, and even France, and goover to England.</p><p>He had warned Cosette. He wished to set out before the end of the week.</p><p>He had seated himself on the slope in the Champ-de-Mars, turning over allsorts of thoughts in his mind,&mdash;Thénardier, the police, the journey,and the difficulty of procuring a passport.</p><p>He was troubled from all these points of view.</p><p>Last of all, an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted hisattention, and from which he had not yet recovered, had added to his stateof alarm.</p><p>On the morning of that very day, when he alone of the household wasstirring, while strolling in the garden before Cosette&rsquo;s shutters wereopen, he had suddenly perceived on the wall, the following line, engraved,probably with a nail:&mdash;</p><p><i>16 Rue de la Verrerie</i>.</p><p>This was perfectly fresh, the grooves in the ancient black mortar werewhite, a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with thefine, fresh plaster.</p><p>This had probably been written on the preceding night.</p><p>What was this?

A warning for himself?</p><p>In any case, it was evident that the garden had been violated, and thatstrangers had made their way into it.</p><p>He recalled the odd incidents which had already alarmed the household.</p><p>His mind was now filling in this canvas.</p><p>He took good care not to speak to Cosette of the line written on the wall,for fear of alarming her.</p><p>In the midst of his preoccupations, he perceived, from a shadow cast bythe sun, that some one had halted on the crest of the slope immediatelybehind him.</p><p>He was on the point of turning round, when a paper folded in four fellupon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head.</p><p>He took the paper, unfolded it, and read these words written in largecharacters, with a pencil:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean sprang hastily to his feet; there was no one on the slope; hegazed all around him and perceived a creature larger than a child, not solarge as a man, clad in a gray blouse and trousers of dust-colored cottonvelvet, who was jumping over the parapet and who slipped into the moat ofthe Champ-de-Mars.</p><p>Jean Valjean returned home at once, in a very thoughtful mood.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0264" id="link2HCH0264"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;MARIUS</h3><p>Marius had left M. Gillenormand in despair. He had entered the house withvery little hope, and quitted it with immense despair.</p><p>However, and those who have observed the depths of the human heart willunderstand this, the officer, the lancer, the ninny, Cousin Théodule, hadleft no trace in his mind. Not the slightest. The dramatic poet might,apparently, expect some complications from this revelation madepoint-blank by the grandfather to the grandson. But what the drama wouldgain thereby, truth would lose. Marius was at an age when one believesnothing in the line of evil; later on comes the age when one believeseverything. Suspicions are nothing else than wrinkles. Early youth hasnone of them. That which overwhelmed Othello glides innocuous overCandide. Suspect Cosette! There are hosts of crimes which Marius couldsooner have committed.</p><p>He began to wander about the streets, the resource of those who suffer. Hethought of nothing, so far as he could afterwards remember. At two o&rsquo;clockin the morning he returned to Courfeyrac&rsquo;s quarters and flung himself,without undressing, on his mattress. The sun was shining brightly when hesank into that frightful leaden slumber which permits ideas to go and comein the brain. When he awoke, he saw Courfeyrac, Enjolras, Feuilly, andCombeferre standing in the room with their hats on and all ready to goout.</p><p>Courfeyrac said to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you coming to General Lamarque&rsquo;s funeral?&rdquo;</p><p>It seemed to him that Courfeyrac was speaking Chinese.</p><p>He went out some time after them. He put in his pocket the pistols whichJavert had given him at the time of the adventure on the 3d of February,and which had remained in his hands. These pistols were still loaded. Itwould be difficult to say what vague thought he had in his mind when hetook them with him.</p><p>All day long he prowled about, without knowing where he was going; itrained at times, he did not perceive it; for his dinner, he purchased apenny roll at a baker&rsquo;s, put it in his pocket and forgot it. It appearsthat he took a bath in the Seine without being aware of it. There aremoments when a man has a furnace within his skull. Marius was passingthrough one of those moments. He no longer hoped for anything; this stephe had taken since the preceding evening. He waited for night withfeverish impatience, he had but one idea clearly before his mind;&mdash;thiswas, that at nine o&rsquo;clock he should see Cosette. This last happiness nowconstituted his whole future; after that, gloom. At intervals, as heroamed through the most deserted boulevards, it seemed to him that heheard strange noises in Paris. He thrust his head out of his reverie andsaid: &ldquo;Is there fighting on hand?&rdquo;</p><p>At nightfall, at nine o&rsquo;clock precisely, as he had promised Cosette, hewas in the Rue Plumet. When he approached the grating he forgoteverything. It was forty-eight hours since he had seen Cosette; he wasabout to behold her once more; every other thought was effaced, and hefelt only a profound and unheard-of joy. Those minutes in which one livescenturies always have this sovereign and wonderful property, that at themoment when they are passing they fill the heart completely.</p><p>Marius displaced the bar, and rushed headlong into the garden. Cosette wasnot at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him. He traversed thethicket, and approached the recess near the flight of steps: &ldquo;She iswaiting for me there,&rdquo; said he. Cosette was not there. He raised his eyes,and saw that the shutters of the house were closed. He made the tour ofthe garden, the garden was deserted. Then he returned to the house, and,rendered senseless by love, intoxicated, terrified, exasperated with griefand uneasiness, like a master who returns home at an evil hour, he tappedon the shutters. He knocked and knocked again, at the risk of seeing thewindow open, and her father&rsquo;s gloomy face make its appearance, and demand:&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; This was nothing in comparison with what he dimlycaught a glimpse of. When he had rapped, he lifted up his voice and calledCosette.&mdash;&ldquo;Cosette!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;Cosette!&rdquo; he repeated imperiously.There was no reply. All was over. No one in the garden; no one in thehouse.</p><p>Marius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house, which was as blackand as silent as a tomb and far more empty. He gazed at the stone seat onwhich he had passed so many adorable hours with Cosette. Then he seatedhimself on the flight of steps, his heart filled with sweetness andresolution, he blessed his love in the depths of his thought, and he saidto himself that, since Cosette was gone, all that there was left for himwas to die.</p><p>All at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street, andwhich was calling to him through the trees:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Marius!&rdquo;</p><p>He started to his feet.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Marius, are you there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mr. Marius,&rdquo; went on the voice, &ldquo;your friends are waiting for you at thebarricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie.&rdquo;</p><p>This voice was not wholly unfamiliar to him. It resembled the hoarse,rough voice of Éponine. Marius hastened to the gate, thrust aside themovable bar, passed his head through the aperture, and saw some one whoappeared to him to be a young man, disappearing at a run into the gloom.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0265" id="link2HCH0265"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;M. MABEUF</h3><p>Jean Valjean&rsquo;s purse was of no use to M. Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf, in hisvenerable, infantile austerity, had not accepted the gift of the stars; hehad not admitted that a star could coin itself into louis d&rsquo;or. He had notdivined that what had fallen from heaven had come from Gavroche. He hadtaken the purse to the police commissioner of the quarter, as a lostarticle placed by the finder at the disposal of claimants. The purse wasactually lost. It is unnecessary to say that no one claimed it, and thatit did not succor M. Mabeuf.</p><p>Moreover, M. Mabeuf had continued his downward course.</p><p>His experiments on indigo had been no more successful in the Jardin desPlantes than in his garden at Austerlitz. The year before he had owed hishousekeeper&rsquo;s wages; now, as we have seen, he owed three quarters of hisrent. The pawnshop had sold the plates of his <i>Flora</i> after the expirationof thirteen months. Some coppersmith had made stewpans of them. His copperplates gone, and being unable to complete even the incomplete copies ofhis <i>Flora</i> which were in his possession, he had disposed of the text, at amiserable price, as waste paper, to a second-hand bookseller. Nothing nowremained to him of his life&rsquo;s work. He set to work to eat up the money forthese copies. When he saw that this wretched resource was becomingexhausted, he gave up his garden and allowed it to run to waste. Beforethis, a long time before, he had given up his two eggs and the morsel ofbeef which he ate from time to time. He dined on bread and potatoes. Hehad sold the last of his furniture, then all duplicates of his bedding,his clothing and his blankets, then his herbariums and prints; but hestill retained his most precious books, many of which were of the greatestrarity, among others, <i>Les Quadrins Historiques de la Bible</i>, edition of1560; <i>La Concordance des Bibles</i>, by Pierre de Besse; <i>Les Marguerites de laMarguerite</i>, of Jean de La Haye, with a dedication to the Queen of Navarre;the book <i>de la Charge et Dignité de l&rsquo;Ambassadeur</i>, by the Sieur deVilliers Hotman; a <i>Florilegium Rabbinicum</i> of 1644; a <i>Tibullus</i> of 1567,with this magnificent inscription: <i>Venetiis, in ædibus Manutianis</i>; andlastly, a Diogenes Laertius, printed at Lyons in 1644, which contained thefamous variant of the manuscript 411, thirteenth century, of the Vatican,and those of the two manuscripts of Venice, 393 and 394, consulted withsuch fruitful results by Henri Estienne, and all the passages in Doricdialect which are only found in the celebrated manuscript of the twelfthcentury belonging to the Naples Library. M. Mabeuf never had any fire inhis chamber, and went to bed at sundown, in order not to consume anycandles. It seemed as though he had no longer any neighbors: peopleavoided him when he went out; he perceived the fact. The wretchedness of achild interests a mother, the wretchedness of a young man interests ayoung girl, the wretchedness of an old man interests no one. It is, of alldistresses, the coldest. Still, Father Mabeuf had not entirely lost hischildlike serenity. His eyes acquired some vivacity when they rested onhis books, and he smiled when he gazed at the Diogenes Laertius, which wasa unique copy. His bookcase with glass doors was the only piece offurniture which he had kept beyond what was strictly indispensable.</p><p>One day, Mother Plutarque said to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I have no money to buy any dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>What she called dinner was a loaf of bread and four or five potatoes.</p><p>&ldquo;On credit?&rdquo; suggested M. Mabeuf.</p><p>&ldquo;You know well that people refuse me.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Mabeuf opened his bookcase, took a long look at all his books, oneafter another, as a father obliged to decimate his children would gazeupon them before making a choice, then seized one hastily, put it in underhis arm and went out. He returned two hours later, without anything underhis arm, laid thirty sous on the table, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You will get something for dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>From that moment forth, Mother Plutarque saw a sombre veil, which wasnever more lifted, descend over the old man&rsquo;s candid face.</p><p>On the following day, on the day after, and on the day after that, it hadto be done again.</p><p>M. Mabeuf went out with a book and returned with a coin. As thesecond-hand dealers perceived that he was forced to sell, they purchasedof him for twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty francs, sometimesat those very shops. Volume by volume, the whole library went the sameroad. He said at times: &ldquo;But I am eighty;&rdquo; as though he cherished somesecret hope that he should arrive at the end of his days before reachingthe end of his books. His melancholy increased. Once, however, he had apleasure. He had gone out with a Robert Estienne, which he had sold forthirty-five sous under the Quai Malaquais, and he returned with an Alduswhich he had bought for forty sous in the Rue des Grès.&mdash;&ldquo;I owe fivesous,&rdquo; he said, beaming on Mother Plutarque. That day he had no dinner.</p><p>He belonged to the Horticultural Society. His destitution became knownthere. The president of the society came to see him, promised to speak tothe Minister of Agriculture and Commerce about him, and did so.&mdash;&ldquo;Why,what!&rdquo; exclaimed the Minister, &ldquo;I should think so! An old savant! abotanist! an inoffensive man! Something must be done for him!&rdquo; On thefollowing day, M. Mabeuf received an invitation to dine with the Minister.Trembling with joy, he showed the letter to Mother Plutarque. &ldquo;We aresaved!&rdquo; said he. On the day appointed, he went to the Minister&rsquo;s house. Heperceived that his ragged cravat, his long, square coat, and his waxedshoes astonished the ushers. No one spoke to him, not even the Minister.About ten o&rsquo;clock in the evening, while he was still waiting for a word,he heard the Minister&rsquo;s wife, a beautiful woman in a low-necked gown whomhe had not ventured to approach, inquire: &ldquo;Who is that old gentleman?&rdquo; Hereturned home on foot at midnight, in a driving rain-storm. He had sold anElzevir to pay for a carriage in which to go thither.</p><p>He had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his Diogenes Laertiusevery night, before he went to bed. He knew enough Greek to enjoy thepeculiarities of the text which he owned. He had now no other enjoyment.Several weeks passed. All at once, Mother Plutarque fell ill. There is onething sadder than having no money with which to buy bread at the baker&rsquo;sand that is having no money to purchase drugs at the apothecary&rsquo;s. Oneevening, the doctor had ordered a very expensive potion. And the maladywas growing worse; a nurse was required. M. Mabeuf opened his bookcase;there was nothing there. The last volume had taken its departure. All thatwas left to him was Diogenes Laertius. He put this unique copy under hisarm, and went out. It was the 4th of June, 1832; he went to the PorteSaint-Jacques, to Royal&rsquo;s successor, and returned with one hundred francs.He laid the pile of five-franc pieces on the old serving-woman&rsquo;snightstand, and returned to his chamber without saying a word.</p><p>On the following morning, at dawn, he seated himself on the overturnedpost in his garden, and he could be seen over the top of the hedge,sitting the whole morning motionless, with drooping head, his eyes vaguelyfixed on the withered flower-beds. It rained at intervals; the old man didnot seem to perceive the fact.</p><p>In the afternoon, extraordinary noises broke out in Paris. They resembledshots and the clamors of a multitude.</p><p>Father Mabeuf raised his head. He saw a gardener passing, and inquired:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>The gardener, spade on back, replied in the most unconcerned tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It is the riots.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What riots?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, they are fighting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why are they fighting?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, good Heavens!&rdquo; ejaculated the gardener.</p><p>&ldquo;In what direction?&rdquo; went on M. Mabeuf.</p><p>&ldquo;In the neighborhood of the Arsenal.&rdquo;</p><p>Father Mabeuf went to his room, took his hat, mechanically sought for abook to place under his arm, found none, said: &ldquo;Ah! truly!&rdquo; and went offwith a bewildered air.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0307" id="link2H_4_0307"></a>BOOK TENTH&mdash;THE 5TH OF JUNE, 1832</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0266" id="link2HCH0266"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE SURFACE OF THE QUESTION</h3><p>Of what is revolt composed? Of nothing and of everything. Of anelectricity disengaged, little by little, of a flame suddenly dartingforth, of a wandering force, of a passing breath. This breath encountersheads which speak, brains which dream, souls which suffer, passions whichburn, wretchedness which howls, and bears them away.</p><p>Whither?</p><p>At random. Athwart the state, the laws, athwart prosperity and theinsolence of others.</p><p>Irritated convictions, embittered enthusiasms, agitated indignations,instincts of war which have been repressed, youthful courage which hasbeen exalted, generous blindness; curiosity, the taste for change, thethirst for the unexpected, the sentiment which causes one to take pleasurein reading the posters for the new play, and love, the prompter&rsquo;s whistle,at the theatre; the vague hatreds, rancors, disappointments, every vanitywhich thinks that destiny has bankrupted it; discomfort, empty dreams,ambitions that are hedged about, whoever hopes for a downfall, someoutcome, in short, at the very bottom, the rabble, that mud which catchesfire,&mdash;such are the elements of revolt. That which is grandest andthat which is basest; the beings who prowl outside of all bounds, awaitingan occasion, bohemians, vagrants, vagabonds of the crossroads, those whosleep at night in a desert of houses with no other roof than the coldclouds of heaven, those who, each day, demand their bread from chance andnot from toil, the unknown of poverty and nothingness, the bare-armed, thebare-footed, belong to revolt. Whoever cherishes in his soul a secretrevolt against any deed whatever on the part of the state, of life or offate, is ripe for riot, and, as soon as it makes its appearance, he beginsto quiver, and to feel himself borne away with the whirlwind.</p><p>Revolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which formssuddenly in certain conditions of temperature, and which, as it eddiesabout, mounts, descends, thunders, tears, razes, crushes, demolishes,uproots, bearing with it great natures and small, the strong man and thefeeble mind, the tree trunk and the stalk of straw. Woe to him whom itbears away as well as to him whom it strikes! It breaks the one againstthe other.</p><p>It communicates to those whom it seizes an indescribable and extraordinarypower. It fills the firstcomer with the force of events; it convertseverything into projectiles. It makes a cannon-ball of a rough stone, anda general of a porter.</p><p>If we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views, a littlerevolt is desirable from the point of view of power. System: revoltstrengthens those governments which it does not overthrow. It puts thearmy to the test; it consecrates the bourgeoisie, it draws out the musclesof the police; it demonstrates the force of the social framework. It is anexercise in gymnastics; it is almost hygiene. Power is in better healthafter a revolt, as a man is after a good rubbing down.</p><p>Revolt, thirty years ago, was regarded from still other points of view.</p><p>There is for everything a theory, which proclaims itself &ldquo;good sense&rdquo;;Philintus against Alcestis; mediation offered between the false and thetrue; explanation, admonition, rather haughty extenuation which, becauseit is mingled with blame and excuse, thinks itself wisdom, and is oftenonly pedantry. A whole political school called &ldquo;the golden mean&rdquo; has beenthe outcome of this. As between cold water and hot water, it is thelukewarm water party. This school with its false depth, all on thesurface, which dissects effects without going back to first causes, chidesfrom its height of a demi-science, the agitation of the public square.</p><p>If we listen to this school, &ldquo;The riots which complicated the affair of1830 deprived that great event of a portion of its purity. The Revolutionof July had been a fine popular gale, abruptly followed by blue sky. Theymade the cloudy sky reappear. They caused that revolution, at first soremarkable for its unanimity, to degenerate into a quarrel. In theRevolution of July, as in all progress accomplished by fits and starts,there had been secret fractures; these riots rendered them perceptible. Itmight have been said: &lsquo;Ah! this is broken.&rsquo; After the Revolution of July,one was sensible only of deliverance; after the riots, one was consciousof a catastrophe.</p><p>&ldquo;All revolt closes the shops, depresses the funds, throws the Exchangeinto consternation, suspends commerce, clogs business, precipitatesfailures; no more money, private fortunes rendered uneasy, public creditshaken, industry disconcerted, capital withdrawing, work at a discount,fear everywhere; counter-shocks in every town. Hence gulfs. It has beencalculated that the first day of a riot costs France twenty millions, thesecond day forty, the third sixty, a three days&rsquo; uprising costs onehundred and twenty millions, that is to say, if only the financial resultbe taken into consideration, it is equivalent to a disaster, a shipwreckor a lost battle, which should annihilate a fleet of sixty ships of theline.</p><p>&ldquo;No doubt, historically, uprisings have their beauty; the war of thepavements is no less grandiose, and no less pathetic, than the war ofthickets: in the one there is the soul of forests, in the other the heartof cities; the one has Jean Chouan, the other has a Jeanne. Revolts haveilluminated with a red glare all the most original points of the Parisiancharacter, generosity, devotion, stormy gayety, students proving thatbravery forms part of intelligence, the National Guard invincible,bivouacs of shopkeepers, fortresses of street urchins, contempt of deathon the part of passers-by. Schools and legions clashed together. Afterall, between the combatants, there was only a difference of age; the raceis the same; it is the same stoical men who died at the age of twenty fortheir ideas, at forty for their families. The army, always a sad thing incivil wars, opposed prudence to audacity. Uprisings, while proving popularintrepidity, also educated the courage of the bourgeois.</p><p>&ldquo;This is well. But is all this worth the bloodshed? And to the bloodshedadd the future darkness, progress compromised, uneasiness among the bestmen, honest liberals in despair, foreign absolutism happy in these woundsdealt to revolution by its own hand, the vanquished of 1830 triumphing andsaying: &lsquo;We told you so!&rsquo; Add Paris enlarged, possibly, but France mostassuredly diminished. Add, for all must needs be told, the massacres whichhave too often dishonored the victory of order grown ferocious overliberty gone mad. To sum up all, uprisings have been disastrous.&rdquo;</p><p>Thus speaks that approximation to wisdom with which the bourgeoisie, thatapproximation to the people, so willingly contents itself.</p><p>For our parts, we reject this word <i>uprisings</i> as too large, andconsequently as too convenient. We make a distinction between one popularmovement and another popular movement. We do not inquire whether anuprising costs as much as a battle. Why a battle, in the first place? Herethe question of war comes up. Is war less of a scourge than an uprising isof a calamity? And then, are all uprisings calamities? And what if therevolt of July did cost a hundred and twenty millions? The establishmentof Philip V. in Spain cost France two milliards. Even at the same price,we should prefer the 14th of July. However, we reject these figures, whichappear to be reasons and which are only words. An uprising being given, weexamine it by itself. In all that is said by the doctrinarian objectionabove presented, there is no question of anything but effect, we seek thecause.</p><p>We will be explicit.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0267" id="link2HCH0267"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE ROOT OF THE MATTER</h3><p>There is such a thing as an uprising, and there is such a thing asinsurrection; these are two separate phases of wrath; one is in the wrong,the other is in the right. In democratic states, the only ones which arefounded on justice, it sometimes happens that the fraction usurps; thenthe whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may proceed as faras resort to arms. In all questions which result from collectivesovereignty, the war of the whole against the fraction is insurrection;the attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt; according as theTuileries contain a king or the Convention, they are justly or unjustlyattacked. The same cannon, pointed against the populace, is wrong on the10th of August, and right on the 14th of Vendémiaire. Alike in appearance,fundamentally different in reality; the Swiss defend the false, Bonapartedefends the true. That which universal suffrage has effected in itsliberty and in its sovereignty cannot be undone by the street. It is thesame in things pertaining purely to civilization; the instinct of themasses, clear-sighted to-day, may be troubled to-morrow. The same furylegitimate when directed against Terray and absurd when directed againstTurgot. The destruction of machines, the pillage of warehouses, thebreaking of rails, the demolition of docks, the false routes ofmultitudes, the refusal by the people of justice to progress, Ramusassassinated by students, Rousseau driven out of Switzerland and stoned,&mdash;thatis revolt. Israel against Moses, Athens against Phocian, Rome againstCicero,&mdash;that is an uprising; Paris against the Bastille,&mdash;thatis insurrection. The soldiers against Alexander, the sailors againstChristopher Columbus,&mdash;this is the same revolt; impious revolt; why?Because Alexander is doing for Asia with the sword that which ChristopherColumbus is doing for America with the compass; Alexander like Columbus,is finding a world. These gifts of a world to civilization are suchaugmentations of light, that all resistance in that case is culpable.Sometimes the populace counterfeits fidelity to itself. The masses aretraitors to the people. Is there, for example, anything stranger than thatlong and bloody protest of dealers in contraband salt, a legitimatechronic revolt, which, at the decisive moment, on the day of salvation, atthe very hour of popular victory, espouses the throne, turns into<i>chouannerie</i>, and, from having been an insurrection against, becomes anuprising for, sombre masterpieces of ignorance! The contraband salt dealerescapes the royal gibbets, and with a rope&rsquo;s end round his neck, mountsthe white cockade. &ldquo;Death to the salt duties,&rdquo; brings forth, &ldquo;Long livethe King!&rdquo; The assassins of Saint-Barthélemy, the cut-throats ofSeptember, the manslaughterers of Avignon, the assassins of Coligny, theassassins of Madam Lamballe, the assassins of Brune, Miquelets, Verdets,Cadenettes, the companions of Jéhu, the chevaliers of Brassard,&mdash;beholdan uprising. La Vendée is a grand, catholic uprising. The sound of rightin movement is recognizable, it does not always proceed from the tremblingof excited masses; there are mad rages, there are cracked bells, alltocsins do not give out the sound of bronze. The brawl of passions andignorances is quite another thing from the shock of progress. Show me inwhat direction you are going. Rise, if you will, but let it be that youmay grow great. There is no insurrection except in a forward direction.Any other sort of rising is bad; every violent step towards the rear is arevolt; to retreat is to commit a deed of violence against the human race.Insurrection is a fit of rage on the part of truth; the pavements whichthe uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right. These pavementsbequeath to the uprising only their mud. Danton against Louis XIV. isinsurrection; Hébert against Danton is revolt.</p><p>Hence it results that if insurrection in given cases may be, as Lafayettesays, the most holy of duties, an uprising may be the most fatal ofcrimes.</p><p>There is also a difference in the intensity of heat; insurrection is oftena volcano, revolt is often only a fire of straw.</p><p>Revolt, as we have said, is sometimes found among those in power. Polignacis a rioter; Camille Desmoulins is one of the governing powers.</p><p>Insurrection is sometimes resurrection.</p><p>The solution of everything by universal suffrage being an absolutelymodern fact, and all history anterior to this fact being, for the space offour thousand years, filled with violated right, and the suffering ofpeoples, each epoch of history brings with it that protest of which it iscapable. Under the Cæsars, there was no insurrection, but there wasJuvenal.</p><p>The <i>facit indignatio</i> replaces the Gracchi.</p><p>Under the Cæsars, there is the exile to Syene; there is also the man ofthe <i>Annales</i>. We do not speak of the immense exile of Patmos who, on hispart also, overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name of theideal world, who makes of his vision an enormous satire and casts onRome-Nineveh, on Rome-Babylon, on Rome-Sodom, the flaming reflection ofthe Apocalypse. John on his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal; we mayunderstand him, he is a Jew, and it is Hebrew; but the man who writes the<i>Annales</i> is of the Latin race, let us rather say he is a Roman.</p><p>As the Neros reign in a black way, they should be painted to match. Thework of the graving-tool alone would be too pale; there must be pouredinto the channel a concentrated prose which bites.</p><p>Despots count for something in the question of philosophers. A word thatis chained is a terrible word. The writer doubles and trebles his stylewhen silence is imposed on a nation by its master. From this silence therearises a certain mysterious plenitude which filters into thought and therecongeals into bronze. The compression of history produces conciseness inthe historian. The granite solidity of such and such a celebrated prose isnothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant.</p><p>Tyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which areaugmentations of force. The Ciceronian period, which hardly sufficed forVerres, would be blunted on Caligula. The less spread of sail in thephrase, the more intensity in the blow. Tacitus thinks with all his might.</p><p>The honesty of a great heart, condensed in justice and truth, overwhelmsas with lightning.</p><p>Be it remarked, in passing, that Tacitus is not historically superposedupon Cæsar. The Tiberii were reserved for him. Cæsar and Tacitus are twosuccessive phenomena, a meeting between whom seems to be mysteriouslyavoided, by the One who, when He sets the centuries on the stage,regulates the entrances and the exits. Cæsar is great, Tacitus is great;God spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them to clash with oneanother. The guardian of justice, in striking Cæsar, might strike too hardand be unjust. God does not will it. The great wars of Africa and Spain,the pirates of Sicily destroyed, civilization introduced into Gaul, intoBritanny, into Germany,&mdash;all this glory covers the Rubicon. There ishere a sort of delicacy of the divine justice, hesitating to let looseupon the illustrious usurper the formidable historian, sparing CæsarTacitus, and according extenuating circumstances to genius.</p><p>Certainly, despotism remains despotism, even under the despot of genius.There is corruption under all illustrious tyrants, but the moral pest isstill more hideous under infamous tyrants. In such reigns, nothing veilsthe shame; and those who make examples, Tacitus as well as Juvenal, slapthis ignominy which cannot reply, in the face, more usefully in thepresence of all humanity.</p><p>Rome smells worse under Vitellius than under Sylla. Under Claudius andunder Domitian, there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to therepulsiveness of the tyrant. The villainy of slaves is a direct product ofthe despot; a miasma exhales from these cowering consciences wherein themaster is reflected; public powers are unclean; hearts are small;consciences are dull, souls are like vermin; thus it is under Caracalla,thus it is under Commodus, thus it is under Heliogabalus, while, from theRoman Senate, under Cæsar, there comes nothing but the odor of the dungwhich is peculiar to the eyries of the eagles.</p><p>Hence the advent, apparently tardy, of the Tacituses and the Juvenals; itis in the hour for evidence, that the demonstrator makes his appearance.</p><p>But Juvenal and Tacitus, like Isaiah in Biblical times, like Dante in theMiddle Ages, is man; riot and insurrection are the multitude, which issometimes right and sometimes wrong.</p><p>In the majority of cases, riot proceeds from a material fact; insurrectionis always a moral phenomenon. Riot is Masaniello; insurrection, Spartacus.Insurrection borders on mind, riot on the stomach; Gaster grows irritated;but Gaster, assuredly, is not always in the wrong. In questions of famine,riot, Buzançais, for example, holds a true, pathetic, and just point ofdeparture. Nevertheless, it remains a riot. Why? It is because, right atbottom, it was wrong in form. Shy although in the right, violent althoughstrong, it struck at random; it walked like a blind elephant; it leftbehind it the corpses of old men, of women, and of children; it wished theblood of inoffensive and innocent persons without knowing why. Thenourishment of the people is a good object; to massacre them is a badmeans.</p><p>All armed protests, even the most legitimate, even that of the 10th ofAugust, even that of July 14th, begin with the same troubles. Before theright gets set free, there is foam and tumult. In the beginning, theinsurrection is a riot, just as a river is a torrent. Ordinarily it endsin that ocean: revolution. Sometimes, however, coming from those loftymountains which dominate the moral horizon, justice, wisdom, reason,right, formed of the pure snow of the ideal, after a long fall from rockto rock, after having reflected the sky in its transparency and increasedby a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph, insurrection issuddenly lost in some quagmire, as the Rhine is in a swamp.</p><p>All this is of the past, the future is another thing. Universal suffragehas this admirable property, that it dissolves riot in its inception, and,by giving the vote to insurrection, it deprives it of its arms. Thedisappearance of wars, of street wars as well as of wars on the frontiers,such is the inevitable progression. Whatever To-day may be, To-morrow willbe peace.</p><p>However, insurrection, riot, and points of difference between the formerand the latter,&mdash;the bourgeois, properly speaking, knows nothing ofsuch shades. In his mind, all is sedition, rebellion pure and simple, therevolt of the dog against his master, an attempt to bite whom must bepunished by the chain and the kennel, barking, snapping, until such day asthe head of the dog, suddenly enlarged, is outlined vaguely in the gloomface to face with the lion.</p><p>Then the bourgeois shouts: &ldquo;Long live the people!&rdquo;</p><p>This explanation given, what does the movement of June, 1832, signify, sofar as history is concerned? Is it a revolt? Is it an insurrection?</p><p>It may happen to us, in placing this formidable event on the stage, to sayrevolt now and then, but merely to distinguish superficial facts, andalways preserving the distinction between revolt, the form, andinsurrection, the foundation.</p><p>This movement of 1832 had, in its rapid outbreak and in its melancholyextinction, so much grandeur, that even those who see in it only anuprising, never refer to it otherwise than with respect. For them, it islike a relic of 1830. Excited imaginations, say they, are not to be calmedin a day. A revolution cannot be cut off short. It must needs undergo someundulations before it returns to a state of rest, like a mountain sinkinginto the plain. There are no Alps without their Jura, nor Pyrenees withoutthe Asturias.</p><p>This pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory of Parisianscalls &ldquo;the epoch of the riots,&rdquo; is certainly a characteristic hour amidthe stormy hours of this century. A last word, before we enter on therecital.</p><p>The facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic and livingreality, which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of time andspace. There, nevertheless, we insist upon it, is life, palpitation, humantremor. Petty details, as we think we have already said, are, so to speak,the foliage of great events, and are lost in the distance of history. Theepoch, surnamed &ldquo;of the riots,&rdquo; abounds in details of this nature.Judicial inquiries have not revealed, and perhaps have not sounded thedepths, for another reason than history. We shall therefore bring tolight, among the known and published peculiarities, things which have notheretofore been known, about facts over which have passed theforgetfulness of some, and the death of others. The majority of the actorsin these gigantic scenes have disappeared; beginning with the very nextday they held their peace; but of what we shall relate, we shall be ableto say: &ldquo;We have seen this.&rdquo; We alter a few names, for history relates anddoes not inform against, but the deed which we shall paint will begenuine. In accordance with the conditions of the book which we are nowwriting, we shall show only one side and one episode, and certainly, theleast known at that, of the two days, the 5th and the 6th of June, 1832,but we shall do it in such wise that the reader may catch a glimpse,beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift, of the real form ofthis frightful public adventure.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0268" id="link2HCH0268"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;A BURIAL; AN OCCASION TO BE BORN AGAIN</h3><p>In the spring of 1832, although the cholera had been chilling all mindsfor the last three months and had cast over their agitation anindescribable and gloomy pacification, Paris had already long been ripefor commotion. As we have said, the great city resembles a piece ofartillery; when it is loaded, it suffices for a spark to fall, and theshot is discharged. In June, 1832, the spark was the death of GeneralLamarque.</p><p>Lamarque was a man of renown and of action. He had had in succession,under the Empire and under the Restoration, the sorts of bravery requisitefor the two epochs, the bravery of the battle-field and the bravery of thetribune. He was as eloquent as he had been valiant; a sword wasdiscernible in his speech. Like Foy, his predecessor, after upholding thecommand, he upheld liberty; he sat between the left and the extreme left,beloved of the people because he accepted the chances of the future,beloved of the populace because he had served the Emperor well; he was, incompany with Comtes Gérard and Drouet, one of Napoleon&rsquo;s marshals <i>inpetto</i>. The treaties of 1815 removed him as a personal offence. He hatedWellington with a downright hatred which pleased the multitude; and, forseventeen years, he majestically preserved the sadness of Waterloo, payinghardly any attention to intervening events. In his death agony, at hislast hour, he clasped to his breast a sword which had been presented tohim by the officers of the Hundred Days. Napoleon had died uttering theword <i>army</i>, Lamarque uttering the word <i>country</i>.</p><p>His death, which was expected, was dreaded by the people as a loss, and bythe government as an occasion. This death was an affliction. Likeeverything that is bitter, affliction may turn to revolt. This is whattook place.</p><p>On the preceding evening, and on the morning of the 5th of June, the dayappointed for Lamarque&rsquo;s burial, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which theprocession was to touch at, assumed a formidable aspect. This tumultuousnetwork of streets was filled with rumors. They armed themselves as bestthey might. Joiners carried off door-weights of their establishment &ldquo;tobreak down doors.&rdquo; One of them had made himself a dagger of astocking-weaver&rsquo;s hook by breaking off the hook and sharpening the stump.Another, who was in a fever &ldquo;to attack,&rdquo; slept wholly dressed for threedays. A carpenter named Lombier met a comrade, who asked him: &ldquo;Whither areyou going?&rdquo; &ldquo;Eh! well, I have no weapons.&rdquo; &ldquo;What then?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to mytimber-yard to get my compasses.&rdquo; &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; saidLombier. A certain Jacqueline, an expeditious man, accosted some passingartisans: &ldquo;Come here, you!&rdquo; He treated them to ten sous&rsquo; worth of wine andsaid: &ldquo;Have you work?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Go to Filspierre, between the BarrièreCharonne and the Barrière Montreuil, and you will find work.&rdquo; AtFilspierre&rsquo;s they found cartridges and arms. Certain well-known leaderswere going the rounds, that is to say, running from one house to another,to collect their men. At Barthélemy&rsquo;s, near the Barrière du Trône, atCapel&rsquo;s, near the Petit-Chapeau, the drinkers accosted each other with agrave air. They were heard to say: &ldquo;Have you your pistol?&rdquo; &ldquo;Under myblouse.&rdquo; &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Under my shirt.&rdquo; In the Rue Traversière, in front ofthe Bland workshop, and in the yard of the Maison-Brulée, in front oftool-maker Bernier&rsquo;s, groups whispered together. Among them was observed acertain Mavot, who never remained more than a week in one shop, as themasters always discharged him &ldquo;because they were obliged to dispute withhim every day.&rdquo; Mavot was killed on the following day at the barricade ofthe Rue Ménilmontant. Pretot, who was destined to perish also in thestruggle, seconded Mavot, and to the question: &ldquo;What is your object?&rdquo; hereplied: <i>&ldquo;Insurrection.&rdquo;</i> Workmen assembled at the corner of the Rue deBercy, waited for a certain Lemarin, the revolutionary agent for theFaubourg Saint-Marceau. Watchwords were exchanged almost publicly.</p><p>On the 5th of June, accordingly, a day of mingled rain and sun, GeneralLamarque&rsquo;s funeral procession traversed Paris with official military pomp,somewhat augmented through precaution. Two battalions, with draped drumsand reversed arms, ten thousand National Guards, with their swords attheir sides, escorted the coffin. The hearse was drawn by young men. Theofficers of the Invalides came immediately behind it, bearing laurelbranches. Then came an innumerable, strange, agitated multitude, thesectionaries of the Friends of the People, the Law School, the MedicalSchool, refugees of all nationalities, and Spanish, Italian, German, andPolish flags, tricolored horizontal banners, every possible sort ofbanner, children waving green boughs, stone-cutters and carpenters whowere on strike at the moment, printers who were recognizable by theirpaper caps, marching two by two, three by three, uttering cries, nearlyall of them brandishing sticks, some brandishing sabres, without order andyet with a single soul, now a tumultuous rout, again a column. Squadschose themselves leaders; a man armed with a pair of pistols in full view,seemed to pass the host in review, and the files separated before him. Onthe side alleys of the boulevards, in the branches of the trees, onbalconies, in windows, on the roofs, swarmed the heads of men, women, andchildren; all eyes were filled with anxiety. An armed throng was passing,and a terrified throng looked on.</p><p>The Government, on its side, was taking observations. It observed with itshand on its sword. Four squadrons of carabineers could be seen in thePlace Louis XV. in their saddles, with their trumpets at their head,cartridge-boxes filled and muskets loaded, all in readiness to march; inthe Latin country and at the Jardin des Plantes, the Municipal Guardechelonned from street to street; at the Halle-aux-Vins, a squadron ofdragoons; at the Grève half of the 12th Light Infantry, the other halfbeing at the Bastille; the 6th Dragoons at the Célestins; and thecourtyard of the Louvre full of artillery. The remainder of the troopswere confined to their barracks, without reckoning the regiments of theenvirons of Paris. Power being uneasy, held suspended over the menacingmultitude twenty-four thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousand inthe banlieue.</p><p>Divers reports were in circulation in the cortège. Legitimist tricks werehinted at; they spoke of the Duc de Reichstadt, whom God had marked outfor death at that very moment when the populace were designating him forthe Empire. One personage, whose name has remained unknown, announced thatat a given hour two overseers who had been won over, would throw open thedoors of a factory of arms to the people. That which predominated on theuncovered brows of the majority of those present was enthusiasm mingledwith dejection. Here and there, also, in that multitude given over to suchviolent but noble emotions, there were visible genuine visages ofcriminals and ignoble mouths which said: &ldquo;Let us plunder!&rdquo; There arecertain agitations which stir up the bottoms of marshes and make clouds ofmud rise through the water. A phenomenon to which &ldquo;well drilled&rdquo; policemenare no strangers.</p><p>The procession proceeded, with feverish slowness, from the house of thedeceased, by way of the boulevards as far as the Bastille. It rained fromtime to time; the rain mattered nothing to that throng. Many incidents,the coffin borne round the Vendome column, stones thrown at the Duc deFitz-James, who was seen on a balcony with his hat on his head, the Galliccock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mire, a policeman woundedwith a blow from a sword at the Porte Saint-Martin, an officer of the 12thLight Infantry saying aloud: &ldquo;I am a Republican,&rdquo; the Polytechnic Schoolcoming up unexpectedly against orders to remain at home, the shouts of:&ldquo;Long live the Polytechnique! Long live the Republic!&rdquo; marked the passageof the funeral train. At the Bastille, long files of curious andformidable people who descended from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, effecteda junction with the procession, and a certain terrible seething began toagitate the throng.</p><p>One man was heard to say to another: &ldquo;Do you see that fellow with a redbeard, he&rsquo;s the one who will give the word when we are to fire.&rdquo; Itappears that this red beard was present, at another riot, the Quénissetaffair, entrusted with this same function.</p><p>The hearse passed the Bastille, traversed the small bridge, and reachedthe esplanade of the bridge of Austerlitz. There it halted. The crowd,surveyed at that moment with a bird&rsquo;s-eye view, would have presented theaspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade and whose tail spreadout over the Quai Bourdon, covered the Bastille, and was prolonged on theboulevard as far as the Porte Saint-Martin. A circle was traced around thehearse. The vast rout held their peace. Lafayette spoke and bade Lamarquefarewell. This was a touching and august instant, all heads uncovered, allhearts beat high.</p><p>All at once, a man on horseback, clad in black, made his appearance in themiddle of the group with a red flag, others say, with a pike surmountedwith a red liberty-cap. Lafayette turned aside his head. Exelmans quittedthe procession.</p><p>This red flag raised a storm, and disappeared in the midst of it. From theBoulevard Bourdon to the bridge of Austerlitz one of those clamors whichresemble billows stirred the multitude. Two prodigious shouts went up:&ldquo;Lamarque to the Pantheon!&mdash;Lafayette to the Town-hall!&rdquo; Some youngmen, amid the declamations of the throng, harnessed themselves and beganto drag Lamarque in the hearse across the bridge of Austerlitz andLafayette in a hackney-coach along the Quai Morland.</p><p>In the crowd which surrounded and cheered Lafayette, it was noticed that aGerman showed himself named Ludwig Snyder, who died a centenarianafterwards, who had also been in the war of 1776, and who had fought atTrenton under Washington, and at Brandywine under Lafayette.</p><p>In the meantime, the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set inmotion, and came to bar the bridge, on the right bank the dragoons emergedfrom the Célestins and deployed along the Quai Morland. The men who weredragging Lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the corner of the quayand shouted: &ldquo;The dragoons!&rdquo; The dragoons advanced at a walk, in silence,with their pistols in their holsters, their swords in their scabbards,their guns slung in their leather sockets, with an air of gloomyexpectation.</p><p>They halted two hundred paces from the little bridge. The carriage inwhich sat Lafayette advanced to them, their ranks opened and allowed it topass, and then closed behind it. At that moment the dragoons and the crowdtouched. The women fled in terror. What took place during that fatalminute? No one can say. It is the dark moment when two clouds cometogether. Some declare that a blast of trumpets sounding the charge washeard in the direction of the Arsenal, others that a blow from a dagger wasgiven by a child to a dragoon. The fact is, that three shots were suddenlydischarged: the first killed Cholet, chief of the squadron, the secondkilled an old deaf woman who was in the act of closing her window, thethird singed the shoulder of an officer; a woman screamed: &ldquo;They arebeginning too soon!&rdquo; and all at once, a squadron of dragoons which hadremained in the barracks up to this time, was seen to debouch at a gallopwith bared swords, through the Rue Bassompierre and the Boulevard Bourdon,sweeping all before them.</p><p>Then all is said, the tempest is loosed, stones rain down, a fusilladebreaks forth, many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank, andpass the small arm of the Seine, now filled in, the timber-yards of theIsle Louviers, that vast citadel ready to hand, bristle with combatants,stakes are torn up, pistol-shots fired, a barricade begun, the young menwho are thrust back pass the Austerlitz bridge with the hearse at a run,and the municipal guard, the carabineers rush up, the dragoons ply theirswords, the crowd disperses in all directions, a rumor of war flies to allfour quarters of Paris, men shout: &ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; they run, tumble down, flee,resist. Wrath spreads abroad the riot as wind spreads a fire.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0269" id="link2HCH0269"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE EBULLITIONS OF FORMER DAYS</h3><p>Nothing is more extraordinary than the first breaking out of a riot.Everything bursts forth everywhere at once. Was it foreseen? Yes. Was itprepared? No. Whence comes it? From the pavements. Whence falls it? Fromthe clouds. Here insurrection assumes the character of a plot; there of animprovisation. The first comer seizes a current of the throng and leads itwhither he wills. A beginning full of terror, in which is mingled a sortof formidable gayety. First come clamors, the shops are closed, thedisplays of the merchants disappear; then come isolated shots; peopleflee; blows from gun-stocks beat against portes-cochères, servants can beheard laughing in the courtyards of houses and saying: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s going tobe a row!&rdquo;</p><p>A quarter of an hour had not elapsed when this is what was taking place attwenty different spots in Paris at once.</p><p>In the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, twenty young men, bearded andwith long hair, entered a dram-shop and emerged a moment later, carrying ahorizontal tricolored flag covered with crape, and having at their headthree men armed, one with a sword, one with a gun, and the third with apike.</p><p>In the Rue des Nonaindières, a very well-dressed bourgeois, who had aprominent belly, a sonorous voice, a bald head, a lofty brow, a blackbeard, and one of these stiff moustaches which will not lie flat, offeredcartridges publicly to passers-by.</p><p>In the Rue Saint-Pierre-Montmartre, men with bare arms carried about ablack flag, on which could be read in white letters this inscription:&ldquo;Republic or Death!&rdquo; In the Rue des Jeûneurs, Rue du Cadran, RueMontorgueil, Rue Mandar, groups appeared waving flags on which could bedistinguished in gold letters, the word <i>section</i> with a number. One ofthese flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe of whitebetween.</p><p>They pillaged a factory of small-arms on the Boulevard Saint-Martin, andthree armorers&rsquo; shops, the first in the Rue Beaubourg, the second in theRue Michel-le-Comte, the other in the Rue du Temple. In a few minutes, thethousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundred andthirty guns, nearly all double-barrelled, sixty-four swords, andeighty-three pistols. In order to provide more arms, one man took the gun,the other the bayonet.</p><p>Opposite the Quai de la Grève, young men armed with muskets installedthemselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing. One ofthem had a flint-lock. They rang, entered, and set about makingcartridges. One of these women relates: &ldquo;I did not know what cartridgeswere; it was my husband who told me.&rdquo;</p><p>One cluster broke into a curiosity shop in the Rue des Vieilles-Haudriettes,and seized yataghans and Turkish arms.</p><p>The body of a mason who had been killed by a gun-shot lay in the Rue de laPerle.</p><p>And then on the right bank, the left bank, on the quays, on theboulevards, in the Latin country, in the quarter of the Halles, pantingmen, artisans, students, members of sections read proclamations andshouted: &ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; broke street lanterns, unharnessed carriages, unpavedthe streets, broke in the doors of houses, uprooted trees, rummagedcellars, rolled out hogsheads, heaped up paving-stones, rough slabs,furniture and planks, and made barricades.</p><p>They forced the bourgeois to assist them in this. They entered thedwellings of women, they forced them to hand over the swords and guns oftheir absent husbands, and they wrote on the door, with whiting: &ldquo;The armshave been delivered&rdquo;; some signed &ldquo;their names&rdquo; to receipts for the gunsand swords and said: &ldquo;Send for them to-morrow at the Mayor&rsquo;s office.&rdquo; Theydisarmed isolated sentinels and National Guardsmen in the streets on theirway to the Townhall. They tore the epaulets from officers. In the Rue duCimitière-Saint-Nicholas, an officer of the National Guard, on beingpursued by a crowd armed with clubs and foils, took refuge with difficultyin a house, whence he was only able to emerge at nightfall and indisguise.</p><p>In the Quartier Saint-Jacques, the students swarmed out of their hotelsand ascended the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe to the Café du Progrèss, or descendedto the Café des Sept-Billards, in the Rue des Mathurins. There, in frontof the door, young men mounted on the stone corner-posts, distributedarms. They plundered the timber-yard in the Rue Transnonain in order toobtain material for barricades. On a single point the inhabitantsresisted, at the corner of the Rue Sainte-Avoye and the RueSimon-Le-Franc, where they destroyed the barricade with their own hands.At a single point the insurgents yielded; they abandoned a barricade begunin the Rue de Temple after having fired on a detachment of the NationalGuard, and fled through the Rue de la Corderie. The detachment picked upin the barricade a red flag, a package of cartridges, and three hundredpistol-balls. The National Guardsmen tore up the flag, and carried off itstattered remains on the points of their bayonets.</p><p>All that we are here relating slowly and successively took placesimultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult,like a mass of tongues of lightning in one clap of thunder. In less thanan hour, twenty-seven barricades sprang out of the earth in the quarter ofthe Halles alone. In the centre was that famous house No. 50, which wasthe fortress of Jeanne and her six hundred companions, and which, flankedon the one hand by a barricade at Saint-Merry, and on the other by abarricade of the Rue Maubuée, commanded three streets, the Rue des Arcis,the Rue Saint-Martin, and the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, which it faced. Thebarricades at right angles fell back, the one of the Rue Montorgueil onthe Grande-Truanderie, the other of the Rue Geoffroy-Langevin on the RueSainte-Avoye. Without reckoning innumerable barricades in twenty otherquarters of Paris, in the Marais, at Mont-Sainte-Geneviève; one in the RueMénilmontant, where was visible a porte-cochère torn from its hinges;another near the little bridge of the Hôtel-Dieu made with an &ldquo;écossais,&rdquo; which had been unharnessed and overthrown, three hundred paces from thePrefecture of Police.</p><p>At the barricade of the Rue des Ménétriers, a well-dressed man distributedmoney to the workmen. At the barricade of the Rue Grenetat, a horsemanmade his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be the commanderof the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of silver. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; saidhe, &ldquo;this is to pay expenses, wine, et cætera.&rdquo; A light-haired young man,without a cravat, went from barricade to barricade, carrying pass-words.Another, with a naked sword, a blue police cap on his head, placedsentinels. In the interior, beyond the barricades, the wine-shops andporters&rsquo; lodges were converted into guard-houses. Otherwise the riot wasconducted after the most scientific military tactics. The narrow, uneven,sinuous streets, full of angles and turns, were admirably chosen; theneighborhood of the Halles, in particular, a network of streets moreintricate than a forest. The Society of the Friends of the People had, itwas said, undertaken to direct the insurrection in the QuartierSainte-Avoye. A man killed in the Rue du Ponceau who was searched had onhis person a plan of Paris.</p><p>That which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was a sortof strange impetuosity which was in the air. The insurrection had abruptlybuilt barricades with one hand, and with the other seized nearly all theposts of the garrison. In less than three hours, like a train of powdercatching fire, the insurgents had invaded and occupied, on the right bank,the Arsenal, the Mayoralty of the Place Royale, the whole of the Marais,the Popincourt arms manufactory, la Galiote, the Château-d&rsquo;Eau, and allthe streets near the Halles; on the left bank, the barracks of theVeterans, Sainte-Pélagie, the Place Maubert, the powder magazine of theDeux-Moulins, and all the barriers. At five o&rsquo;clock in the evening, theywere masters of the Bastille, of the Lingerie, of the Blancs-Manteaux;their scouts had reached the Place des Victoires, and menaced the Bank,the Petits-Pères barracks, and the Post-Office. A third of Paris was inthe hands of the rioters.</p><p>The conflict had been begun on a gigantic scale at all points; and, as aresult of the disarming domiciliary visits, and armorers&rsquo; shops hastilyinvaded, was, that the combat which had begun with the throwing of stoneswas continued with gun-shots.</p><p>About six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, the Passage du Saumon became the fieldof battle. The uprising was at one end, the troops were at the other. Theyfired from one gate to the other. An observer, a dreamer, the author ofthis book, who had gone to get a near view of this volcano, found himselfin the passage between the two fires. All that he had to protect him fromthe bullets was the swell of the two half-columns which separate theshops; he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an hour.</p><p>Meanwhile the call to arms was beaten, the National Guard armed in haste,the legions emerged from the Mayoralities, the regiments from theirbarracks. Opposite the passage de l&rsquo;Ancre a drummer received a blow from adagger. Another, in the Rue du Cygne, was assailed by thirty young men whobroke his instrument, and took away his sword. Another was killed in theRue Grenier-Saint-Lazare. In the Rue Michel-le-Comte, three officers felldead one after the other. Many of the Municipal Guards, on being wounded,in the Rue des Lombards, retreated.</p><p>In front of the Cour-Batave, a detachment of National Guards found a redflag bearing the following inscription: <i>Republican revolution, No. 127</i>.Was this a revolution, in fact?</p><p>The insurrection had made of the centre of Paris a sort of inextricable,tortuous, colossal citadel.</p><p>There was the hearth; there, evidently, was the question. All the rest wasnothing but skirmishes. The proof that all would be decided there lay inthe fact that there was no fighting going on there as yet.</p><p>In some regiments, the soldiers were uncertain, which added to the fearfuluncertainty of the crisis. They recalled the popular ovation which hadgreeted the neutrality of the 53d of the Line in July, 1830. Two intrepidmen, tried in great wars, the Marshal Lobau and General Bugeaud, were incommand, Bugeaud under Lobau. Enormous patrols, composed of battalions ofthe Line, enclosed in entire companies of the National Guard, and precededby a commissary of police wearing his scarf of office, went to reconnoitrethe streets in rebellion. The insurgents, on their side, placed videttesat the corners of all open spaces, and audaciously sent their patrolsoutside the barricades. Each side was watching the other. The Government,with an army in its hand, hesitated; the night was almost upon them, andthe Saint-Merry tocsin began to make itself heard. The Minister of War atthat time, Marshal Soult, who had seen Austerlitz, regarded this with agloomy air.</p><p>These old sailors, accustomed to correct manœuvres and having as resourceand guide only tactics, that compass of battles, are utterly disconcertedin the presence of that immense foam which is called public wrath.</p><p>The National Guards of the suburbs rushed up in haste and disorder. Abattalion of the 12th Light came at a run from Saint-Denis, the 14th ofthe Line arrived from Courbevoie, the batteries of the Military School hadtaken up their position on the Carrousel; cannons were descending fromVincennes.</p><p>Solitude was formed around the Tuileries. Louis Philippe was perfectlyserene.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0270" id="link2HCH0270"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;ORIGINALITY OF PARIS</h3><p>During the last two years, as we have said, Paris had witnessed more thanone insurrection. Nothing is, generally, more singularly calm than thephysiognomy of Paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of therebellious quarters. Paris very speedily accustoms herself to anything,&mdash;itis only a riot,&mdash;and Paris has so many affairs on hand, that she doesnot put herself out for so small a matter. These colossal cities alone canoffer such spectacles. These immense enclosures alone can contain at thesame time civil war and an odd and indescribable tranquillity. Ordinarily,when an insurrection commences, when the shop-keeper hears the drum, thecall to arms, the general alarm, he contents himself with the remark:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There appears to be a squabble in the Rue Saint-Martin.&rdquo;</p><p>Or:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;In the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.&rdquo;</p><p>Often he adds carelessly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Or somewhere in that direction.&rdquo;</p><p>Later on, when the heart-rending and mournful hubbub of musketry andfiring by platoons becomes audible, the shopkeeper says:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting hot! Hullo, it&rsquo;s getting hot!&rdquo;</p><p>A moment later, the riot approaches and gains in force, he shuts up hisshop precipitately, hastily dons his uniform, that is to say, he placeshis merchandise in safety and risks his own person.</p><p>Men fire in a square, in a passage, in a blind alley; they take andre-take the barricade; blood flows, the grape-shot riddles the fronts ofthe houses, the balls kill people in their beds, corpses encumber thestreets. A few streets away, the shock of billiard-balls can be heard inthe cafés.</p><p>The theatres open their doors and present vaudevilles; the curious laughand chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled with war.Hackney-carriages go their way; passers-by are going to a dinner somewherein town. Sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting is going on.</p><p>In 1831, a fusillade was stopped to allow a wedding party to pass.</p><p>At the time of the insurrection of 1839, in the Rue Saint-Martin a little,infirm old man, pushing a hand-cart surmounted by a tricolored rag, inwhich he had carafes filled with some sort of liquid, went and came frombarricade to troops and from troops to the barricade, offering his glassesof cocoa impartially,&mdash;now to the Government, now to anarchy.</p><p>Nothing can be stranger; and this is the peculiar character of uprisingsin Paris, which cannot be found in any other capital. To this end, twothings are requisite, the size of Paris and its gayety. The city ofVoltaire and Napoleon is necessary.</p><p>On this occasion, however, in the resort to arms of June 5th, 1832, thegreat city felt something which was, perhaps, stronger than itself. It wasafraid.</p><p>Closed doors, windows, and shutters were to be seen everywhere, in themost distant and most &ldquo;disinterested&rdquo; quarters. The courageous took toarms, the poltroons hid. The busy and heedless passer-by disappeared. Manystreets were empty at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p><p>Alarming details were hawked about, fatal news was disseminated,&mdash;that<i>they</i> were masters of the Bank;&mdash;that there were six hundred of themin the Cloister of Saint-Merry alone, entrenched and embattled in thechurch; that the line was not to be depended on; that Armand Carrel hadbeen to see Marshal Clausel and that the Marshal had said: &ldquo;Get a regimentfirst&rdquo;; that Lafayette was ill, but that he had said to them,nevertheless: &ldquo;I am with you. I will follow you wherever there is room fora chair&rdquo;; that one must be on one&rsquo;s guard; that at night there would bepeople pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of Paris(there the imagination of the police, that Anne Radcliffe mixed up withthe Government was recognizable); that a battery had been established inthe Rue Aubry le Boucher; that Lobau and Bugeaud were putting their headstogether, and that, at midnight, or at daybreak at latest, four columnswould march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising, the first comingfrom the Bastille, the second from the Porte Saint-Martin, the third fromthe Grève, the fourth from the Halles; that perhaps, also, the troopswould evacuate Paris and withdraw to the Champ-de-Mars; that no one knewwhat would happen, but that this time, it certainly was serious.</p><p>People busied themselves over Marshal Soult&rsquo;s hesitations. Why did not heattack at once? It is certain that he was profoundly absorbed. The oldlion seemed to scent an unknown monster in that gloom.</p><p>Evening came, the theatres did not open; the patrols circulated with anair of irritation; passers-by were searched; suspicious persons werearrested. By nine o&rsquo;clock, more than eight hundred persons had beenarrested, the Prefecture of Police was encumbered with them, so was theConciergerie, so was La Force.</p><p>At the Conciergerie in particular, the long vault which is called the Ruede Paris was littered with trusses of straw upon which lay a heap ofprisoners, whom the man of Lyons, Lagrange, harangued valiantly. All thatstraw rustled by all these men, produced the sound of a heavy shower.Elsewhere prisoners slept in the open air in the meadows, piled on top ofeach other.</p><p>Anxiety reigned everywhere, and a certain tremor which was not habitualwith Paris.</p><p>People barricaded themselves in their houses; wives and mothers wereuneasy; nothing was to be heard but this: &ldquo;Ah! my God! He has not comehome!&rdquo; There was hardly even the distant rumble of a vehicle to be heard.</p><p>People listened on their thresholds, to the rumors, the shouts, thetumult, the dull and indistinct sounds, to the things that were said: &ldquo;Itis cavalry,&rdquo; or: &ldquo;Those are the caissons galloping,&rdquo; to the trumpets, thedrums, the firing, and, above all, to that lamentable alarm peal fromSaint-Merry.</p><p>They waited for the first cannon-shot. Men sprang up at the corners of thestreets and disappeared, shouting: &ldquo;Go home!&rdquo; And people made haste tobolt their doors. They said: &ldquo;How will all this end?&rdquo; From moment tomoment, in proportion as the darkness descended, Paris seemed to take on amore mournful hue from the formidable flaming of the revolt.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0313" id="link2H_4_0313"></a>BOOK ELEVENTH&mdash;THE ATOM FRATERNIZES WITH THE HURRICANE</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0271" id="link2HCH0271"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;SOME EXPLANATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE ORIGIN OF GAVROCHE&rsquo;SPOETRY. THE INFLUENCE OF AN ACADEMICIAN ON THIS POETRY</h3><p>At the instant when the insurrection, arising from the shock of thepopulace and the military in front of the Arsenal, started a movement inadvance and towards the rear in the multitude which was following thehearse and which, through the whole length of the boulevards, weighed, soto speak, on the head of the procession, there arose a frightful ebb. Therout was shaken, their ranks were broken, all ran, fled, made theirescape, some with shouts of attack, others with the pallor of flight. Thegreat river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling,overflowed to right and left, and spread in torrents over two hundredstreets at once with the roar of a sewer that has broken loose.</p><p>At that moment, a ragged child who was coming down through the RueMénilmontant, holding in his hand a branch of blossoming laburnum which hehad just plucked on the heights of Belleville, caught sight of an oldholster-pistol in the show-window of a bric-à-brac merchant&rsquo;s shop.</p><p>&ldquo;Mother What&rsquo;s-your-name, I&rsquo;m going to borrow your machine.&rdquo;</p><p>And off he ran with the pistol.</p><p>Two minutes later, a flood of frightened bourgeois who were fleeingthrough the Rue Amelot and the Rue Basse, encountered the lad brandishinghis pistol and singing:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">La nuit on ne voit rien,<br/>Le jour on voit très bien,<br/>D&rsquo;un écrit apocryphe<br/>Le bourgeois s&rsquo;ébouriffe,<br/>Pratiquez la vertu,<br/>Tutu, chapeau pointu!<a href="#linknote-44" name="linknoteref-44" id="linknoteref-44">44</a></p><p>It was little Gavroche on his way to the wars.</p><p>On the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger.</p><p>Who was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march,and of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion? Weknow not. Who does know? Himself, perhaps. However, Gavroche was well upin all the popular tunes in circulation, and he mingled with them his ownchirpings. An observing urchin and a rogue, he made a potpourri of thevoices of nature and the voices of Paris. He combined the repertory of thebirds with the repertory of the workshops. He was acquainted with thieves,a tribe contiguous to his own. He had, it appears, been for three monthsapprenticed to a printer. He had one day executed a commission for M.Baour-Lormian, one of the Forty. Gavroche was a gamin of letters.</p><p>Moreover, Gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when he had offeredthe hospitality of his elephant to two brats on that villainously rainynight, it was to his own brothers that he had played the part ofProvidence. His brothers in the evening, his father in the morning; thatis what his night had been like. On quitting the Rue des Ballets atdaybreak, he had returned in haste to the elephant, had artisticallyextracted from it the two brats, had shared with them some sort ofbreakfast which he had invented, and had then gone away, confiding them tothat good mother, the street, who had brought him up, almost entirely. Onleaving them, he had appointed to meet them at the same spot in theevening, and had left them this discourse by way of a farewell: &ldquo;I break acane, otherwise expressed, I cut my stick, or, as they say at the court, Ifile off. If you don&rsquo;t find papa and mamma, young &rsquo;uns, come back herethis evening. I&rsquo;ll scramble you up some supper, and I&rsquo;ll give you ashakedown.&rdquo; The two children, picked up by some policeman and placed inthe refuge, or stolen by some mountebank, or having simply strayed off inthat immense Chinese puzzle of a Paris, did not return. The lowest depthsof the actual social world are full of these lost traces. Gavroche did notsee them again. Ten or twelve weeks had elapsed since that night. Morethan once he had scratched the back of his head and said: &ldquo;Where the devilare my two children?&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, he had arrived, pistol in hand, in the Rue duPont-aux-Choux. He noticed that there was but one shop open in thatstreet, and, a matter worthy of reflection, that was a pastry-cook&rsquo;s shop.This presented a providential occasion to eat another apple-turnoverbefore entering the unknown. Gavroche halted, fumbled in his fob, turnedhis pocket inside out, found nothing, not even a sou, and began to shout:&ldquo;Help!&rdquo;</p><p>It is hard to miss the last cake.</p><p>Nevertheless, Gavroche pursued his way.</p><p>Two minutes later he was in the Rue Saint-Louis. While traversing the Ruedu Parc-Royal, he felt called upon to make good the loss of theapple-turnover which had been impossible, and he indulged himself in theimmense delight of tearing down the theatre posters in broad daylight.</p><p>A little further on, on catching sight of a group of comfortable-lookingpersons, who seemed to be landed proprietors, he shrugged his shouldersand spit out at random before him this mouthful of philosophical bile asthey passed:</p><p>&ldquo;How fat those moneyed men are! They&rsquo;re drunk! They just wallow in gooddinners. Ask &rsquo;em what they do with their money. They don&rsquo;t know. They eatit, that&rsquo;s what they do!

Amid the scraps of the Marseillaise which hewas singing, he shouted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;All goes well. I suffer a great deal in my left paw, I&rsquo;m all broken upwith rheumatism, but I&rsquo;m satisfied, citizens. All that the bourgeois haveto do is to bear themselves well, I&rsquo;ll sneeze them out subversivecouplets. What are the police spies? Dogs. And I&rsquo;d just like to have oneof them at the end of my pistol. I&rsquo;m just from the boulevard, my friends.It&rsquo;s getting hot there, it&rsquo;s getting into a little boil, it&rsquo;s simmering.It&rsquo;s time to skim the pot. Forward march, men! Let an impure bloodinundate the furrows! I give my days to my country, I shall never see myconcubine more, Nini, finished, yes, Nini? But never mind! Long live joy!Let&rsquo;s fight, crebleu! I&rsquo;ve had enough of despotism.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, the horse of a lancer of the National Guard having fallen,Gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement, and picked up the man, then heassisted in raising the horse. After which he picked up his pistol andresumed his way. In the Rue de Thorigny, all was peace and silence. Thisapathy, peculiar to the Marais, presented a contrast with the vastsurrounding uproar. Four gossips were chatting in a doorway.</p><p>Scotland has trios of witches, Paris has quartettes of old gossiping hags;and the &ldquo;Thou shalt be King&rdquo; could be quite as mournfully hurled atBonaparte in the Carrefour Baudoyer as at Macbeth on the heath of Armuyr.The croak would be almost identical.</p><p>The gossips of the Rue de Thorigny busied themselves only with their ownconcerns. Three of them were portresses, and the fourth was a rag-pickerwith her basket on her back.</p><p>All four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age,which are decrepitude, decay, ruin, and sadness.</p><p>The rag-picker was humble. In this open-air society, it is the rag-pickerwho salutes and the portress who patronizes. This is caused by the cornerfor refuse, which is fat or lean, according to the will of the portresses,and after the fancy of the one who makes the heap. There may be kindnessin the broom.</p><p>This rag-picker was a grateful creature, and she smiled, with what asmile! on the three portresses. Things of this nature were said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, by the way, is your cat still cross?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good gracious, cats are naturally the enemies of dogs, you know. It&rsquo;s thedogs who complain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And people also.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But the fleas from a cat don&rsquo;t go after people.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the trouble, dogs are dangerous. I remember one year whenthere were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the newspapers.That was at the time when there were at the Tuileries great sheep thatdrew the little carriage of the King of Rome. Do you remember the King ofRome?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I liked the Duc de Bordeau better.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew Louis XVIII. I prefer Louis XVIII.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Meat is awfully dear, isn&rsquo;t it, Mother Patagon?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! don&rsquo;t mention it, the butcher&rsquo;s shop is a horror. A horrible horror&mdash;onecan&rsquo;t afford anything but the poor cuts nowadays.&rdquo;</p><p>Here the rag-picker interposed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ladies, business is dull. The refuse heaps are miserable. No one throwsanything away any more. They eat everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There are poorer people than you, la Vargoulême.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; replied the rag-picker, with deference, &ldquo;I have aprofession.&rdquo;</p><p>A pause succeeded, and the rag-picker, yielding to that necessity forboasting which lies at the bottom of man, added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;In the morning, on my return home, I pick over my basket, I sort mythings. This makes heaps in my room. I put the rags in a basket, the coresand stalks in a bucket, the linen in my cupboard, the woollen stuff in mycommode, the old papers in the corner of the window, the things that aregood to eat in my bowl, the bits of glass in my fireplace, the old shoesbehind my door, and the bones under my bed.&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche had stopped behind her and was listening.</p><p>&ldquo;Old ladies,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what do you mean by talking politics?&rdquo;</p><p>He was assailed by a broadside, composed of a quadruple howl.</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another rascal.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that he&rsquo;s got in his paddle? A pistol?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to know what sort of a beggar&rsquo;s brat this is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That sort of animal is never easy unless he&rsquo;s overturning theauthorities.&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche disdainfully contented himself, by way of reprisal, withelevating the tip of his nose with his thumb and opening his hand wide.</p><p>The rag-picker cried:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You malicious, bare-pawed little wretch!&rdquo;</p><p>The one who answered to the name of Patagon clapped her hands together inhorror.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be evil doings, that&rsquo;s certain. The errand-boy next doorhas a little pointed beard, I have seen him pass every day with a youngperson in a pink bonnet on his arm; to-day I saw him pass, and he had agun on his arm. Mame Bacheux says, that last week there was a revolutionat&mdash;at&mdash;at&mdash;where&rsquo;s the calf!&mdash;at Pontoise. And then,there you see him, that horrid scamp, with his pistol! It seems that theCélestins are full of pistols. What do you suppose the Government can dowith good-for-nothings who don&rsquo;t know how to do anything but contrive waysof upsetting the world, when we had just begun to get a little quiet afterall the misfortunes that have happened, good Lord! to that poor queen whomI saw pass in the tumbril! And all this is going to make tobacco dearer.It&rsquo;s infamous! And I shall certainly go to see him beheaded on theguillotine, the wretch!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the sniffles, old lady,&rdquo; said Gavroche. &ldquo;Blow yourpromontory.&rdquo;</p><p>And he passed on. When he was in the Rue Pavée, the rag-picker occurred tohis mind, and he indulged in this soliloquy:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the wrong to insult the revolutionists, MotherDust-Heap-Corner. This pistol is in your interests. It&rsquo;s so that you mayhave more good things to eat in your basket.&rdquo;</p><p>All at once, he heard a shout behind him; it was the portress Patagon whohad followed him, and who was shaking her fist at him in the distance andcrying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nothing but a bastard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! Come now,&rdquo; said Gavroche, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a brass farthing for that!&rdquo;</p><p>Shortly afterwards, he passed the Hotel Lamoignon. There he uttered thisappeal:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Forward march to the battle!&rdquo;</p><p>And he was seized with a fit of melancholy. He gazed at his pistol with anair of reproach which seemed an attempt to appease it:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going off,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t go off!&rdquo;</p><p>One dog may distract the attention from another dog.<a href="#linknote-45" name="linknoteref-45" id="linknoteref-45">45</a> A very gaunt poodle camealong at the moment.

They were talking. Thehair-dresser had, naturally, spoken to the veteran of the riot, then ofGeneral Lamarque, and from Lamarque they had passed to the Emperor. Thencesprang up a conversation between barber and soldier which Prudhomme, hadhe been present, would have enriched with arabesques, and which he wouldhave entitled: &ldquo;Dialogue between the razor and the sword.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How did the Emperor ride, sir?&rdquo; said the barber.</p><p>&ldquo;Badly. He did not know how to fall&mdash;so he never fell.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did he have fine horses? He must have had fine horses!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On the day when he gave me my cross, I noticed his beast. It was a racingmare, perfectly white. Her ears were very wide apart, her saddle deep, afine head marked with a black star, a very long neck, strongly articulatedknees, prominent ribs, oblique shoulders and a powerful crupper. A littlemore than fifteen hands in height.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A pretty horse,&rdquo; remarked the hair-dresser.</p><p>&ldquo;It was His Majesty&rsquo;s beast.&rdquo;</p><p>The hair-dresser felt, that after this observation, a short silence wouldbe fitting, so he conformed himself to it, and then went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The Emperor was never wounded but once, was he, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>The old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of a man who hadbeen there:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;In the heel. At Ratisbon. I never saw him so well dressed as on that day.He was as neat as a new sou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you, Mr. Veteran, you must have been often wounded?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said the soldier, &ldquo;ah! not to amount to anything. At Marengo, Ireceived two sabre-blows on the back of my neck, a bullet in the right armat Austerlitz, another in the left hip at Jena. At Friedland, a thrustfrom a bayonet, there,&mdash;at the Moskowa seven or eight lance-thrusts,no matter where, at Lutzen a splinter of a shell crushed one of myfingers. Ah! and then at Waterloo, a ball from a biscaïen in the thigh,that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How fine that is!&rdquo; exclaimed the hair-dresser, in Pindaric accents, &ldquo;todie on the field of battle! On my word of honor, rather than die in bed,of an illness, slowly, a bit by bit each day, with drugs, cataplasms,syringes, medicines, I should prefer to receive a cannon-ball in mybelly!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not over fastidious,&rdquo; said the soldier.</p><p>He had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop.

They were armed after afashion. Bahorel and Jean Prouvaire had found them and swelled the group.Enjolras had a double-barrelled hunting-gun, Combeferre the gun of aNational Guard bearing the number of his legion, and in his belt, twopistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed to be seen, Jean Prouvaire anold cavalry musket, Bahorel a rifle; Courfeyrac was brandishing anunsheathed sword-cane. Feuilly, with a naked sword in his hand, marched attheir head shouting: &ldquo;Long live Poland!&rdquo;</p><p>They reached the Quai Morland. Cravatless, hatless, breathless, soaked bythe rain, with lightning in their eyes. Gavroche accosted them calmly:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Courfeyrac.</p><p>Behind Feuilly marched, or rather bounded, Bahorel, who was like a fish inwater in a riot. He wore a scarlet waistcoat, and indulged in the sort ofwords which break everything. His waistcoat astounded a passer-by, whocried in bewilderment:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Here are the reds!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The reds, the reds!&rdquo; retorted Bahorel. &ldquo;A queer kind of fear, bourgeois.For my part I don&rsquo;t tremble before a poppy, the little red hat inspires mewith no alarm. Take my advice, bourgeois, let&rsquo;s leave fear of the red tohorned cattle.&rdquo;</p><p>He caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the mostpeaceable sheet of paper in the world, a permission to eat eggs, a Lentenadmonition addressed by the Archbishop of Paris to his &ldquo;flock.&rdquo;</p><p>Bahorel exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Flock&rsquo;; a polite way of saying geese.&rdquo;</p><p>And he tore the charge from the nail. This conquered Gavroche. From thatinstant Gavroche set himself to study Bahorel.</p><p>&ldquo;Bahorel,&rdquo; observed Enjolras, &ldquo;you are wrong. You should have let thatcharge alone, he is not the person with whom we have to deal, you arewasting your wrath to no purpose. Take care of your supply. One does notfire out of the ranks with the soul any more than with a gun.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Each one in his own fashion, Enjolras,&rdquo; retorted Bahorel. &ldquo;This bishop&rsquo;sprose shocks me; I want to eat eggs without being permitted. Your style isthe hot and cold; I am amusing myself. Besides, I&rsquo;m not wasting myself,I&rsquo;m getting a start; and if I tore down that charge, Hercle! &rsquo;twas only towhet my appetite.&rdquo;</p><p>This word, <i>Hercle</i>, struck Gavroche. He sought all occasions for learning,and that tearer-down of posters possessed his esteem. He inquired of him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What does <i>Hercle</i> mean?&rdquo;</p><p>Bahorel answered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It means cursed name of a dog, in Latin.&rdquo;</p><p>Here Bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beardwho was watching them as they passed, probably a Friend of the A B C.

What had attracted their attentionwas that the goodman was walking in a zig-zag, as though he wereintoxicated. Moreover, he had his hat in his hand, although it had beenraining all the morning, and was raining pretty briskly at the very time.Courfeyrac had recognized Father Mabeuf. He knew him through having manytimes accompanied Marius as far as his door. As he was acquainted with thepeaceful and more than timid habits of the old beadle-book-collector, andwas amazed at the sight of him in the midst of that uproar, a couple ofpaces from the cavalry charges, almost in the midst of a fusillade,hatless in the rain, and strolling about among the bullets, he hadaccosted him, and the following dialogue had been exchanged between therioter of fire and the octogenarian:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;M. Mabeuf, go to your home.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be a row.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thrusts with the sword and firing, M.

From that moment forth he had notuttered a word. His step had suddenly become firm; artisans had offeredhim their arms; he had refused with a sign of the head. He advanced nearlyto the front rank of the column, with the movement of a man who ismarching and the countenance of a man who is sleeping.</p><p>&ldquo;What a fierce old fellow!&rdquo; muttered the students. The rumor spreadthrough the troop that he was a former member of the Convention,&mdash;anold regicide. The mob had turned in through the Rue de la Verrerie.</p><p>Little Gavroche marched in front with that deafening song which made ofhim a sort of trumpet.</p><p>He sang:</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Voici la lune qui paraît,<br/>Quand irons-nous dans la forêt?<br/>Demandait Charlot à Charlotte.<br/><br/>Tou tou tou<br/>Pour Chatou.<br/>Je n&rsquo;ai qu&rsquo;un Dieu, qu&rsquo;un roi, qu&rsquo;un liard, et qu&rsquo;une botte.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Pour avoir bu de grand matin<br/>La rosée à même le thym,<br/>Deux moineaux étaient en ribotte.<br/><br/>Zi zi zi<br/>Pour Passy.<br/>Je n&rsquo;ai qu&rsquo;un Dieu, qu&rsquo;un roi, qu&rsquo;un liard, et qu&rsquo;une botte.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Et ces deux pauvres petits loups,<br/>Comme deux grives étaient soûls;<br/>Un tigre en riait dans sa grotte.<br/><br/>Don don don<br/>Pour Meudon.<br/>Je n&rsquo;ai qu&rsquo;un Dieu, qu&rsquo;un roi, qu&rsquo;un liard, et qu&rsquo;une botte.<br/><br/>&ldquo;L&rsquo;un jurait et l&rsquo;autre sacrait.<br/>Quand irons nous dans la forêt?<br/>Demandait Charlot à Charlotte.<br/><br/>Tin tin tin<br/>Pour Pantin.<br/>Je n&rsquo;ai qu&rsquo;un Dieu, qu&rsquo;un roi, qu&rsquo;un liard, et qu&rsquo;une botte.&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-46" name="linknoteref-46" id="linknoteref-46">46</a></p><p>They directed their course towards Saint-Merry.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0276" id="link2HCH0276"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;RECRUITS</h3><p>The band augmented every moment.

When he had rejoinedthem, he gave the coffer to one of them to carry. It was only a quarter ofan hour after this that he saw the young man, who had actually followedthem.</p><p>A mob does not go precisely where it intends.

It was on this famous barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie,now fallen into profound obscurity, that we are about to shed a littlelight.</p><p>May we be permitted to recur, for the sake of clearness in the recital, tothe simple means which we have already employed in the case of Waterloo.Persons who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably exact manner theconstitution of the houses which stood at that epoch near the PointeSaint-Eustache, at the northeast angle of the Halles of Paris, whereto-day lies the embouchure of the Rue Rambuteau, have only to imagine an Ntouching the Rue Saint-Denis with its summit and the Halles with its base,and whose two vertical bars should form the Rue de la Grande-Truanderie,and the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and whose transverse bar should be formed bythe Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The old Rue Mondétour cut the threestrokes of the N at the most crooked angles. So that the labyrinthineconfusion of these four streets sufficed to form, on a space three fathomssquare, between the Halles and the Rue Saint-Denis on the one hand, andbetween the Rue du Cygne and the Rue des Prêcheurs on the other, sevenislands of houses, oddly cut up, of varying sizes, placed crosswise andhap-hazard, and barely separated, like the blocks of stone in a dock, bynarrow crannies.</p><p>We say narrow crannies, and we can give no more just idea of those dark,contracted, many-angled alleys, lined with eight-story buildings. Thesebuildings were so decrepit that, in the Rue de la Chanvrerie and the Ruede la Petite-Truanderie, the fronts were shored up with beams running fromone house to another. The street was narrow and the gutter broad, thepedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always wet, skirting littlestalls resembling cellars, big posts encircled with iron hoops, excessiveheaps of refuse, and gates armed with enormous, century-old gratings. TheRue Rambuteau has devastated all that.</p><p>The name of Mondétour paints marvellously well the sinuosities of thatwhole set of streets. A little further on, they are found still betterexpressed by the <i>Rue Pirouette</i>, which ran into the Rue Mondétour.</p><p>The passer-by who got entangled from the Rue Saint-Denis in the Rue de laChanvrerie beheld it gradually close in before him as though he hadentered an elongated funnel. At the end of this street, which was veryshort, he found further passage barred in the direction of the Halles by atall row of houses, and he would have thought himself in a blind alley,had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through which hecould make his escape. This was the Rue Mondétour, which on one side raninto the Rue de Prêcheurs, and on the other into the Rue du Cygne and thePetite-Truanderie. At the bottom of this sort of cul-de-sac, at the angleof the cutting on the right, there was to be seen a house which was not sotall as the rest, and which formed a sort of cape in the street. It is inthis house, of two stories only, that an illustrious wine-shop had beenmerrily installed three hundred years before. This tavern created a joyousnoise in the very spot which old Theophilus described in the followingcouplet:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Là branle le squelette horrible<br/>D&rsquo;un pauvre amant qui se pendit.<a href="#linknote-47" name="linknoteref-47" id="linknoteref-47">47</a></p><p>The situation was good, and tavern-keepers succeeded each other there,from father to son.</p><p>In the time of Mathurin Regnier, this cabaret was called the<i>Pot-aux-Roses</i>, and as the rebus was then in fashion, it had for itssign-board, a post (<i>poteau</i>) painted rose-color. In the last century, theworthy Natoire, one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by thestiff school, having got drunk many times in this wine-shop at the verytable where Regnier had drunk his fill, had painted, by way of gratitude,a bunch of Corinth grapes on the pink post. The keeper of the cabaret, inhis joy, had changed his device and had caused to be placed in giltletters beneath the bunch these words: &ldquo;At the Bunch of Corinth Grapes&rdquo; (<i>&ldquo;Au Raisin de Corinthe&rdquo;</i>). Hence the name of Corinthe. Nothing is morenatural to drunken men than ellipses. The ellipsis is the zig-zag of thephrase. Corinthe gradually dethroned the Pot-aux-Roses. The lastproprietor of the dynasty, Father Hucheloup, no longer acquainted evenwith the tradition, had the post painted blue.</p><p>A room on the ground floor, where the bar was situated, one on the firstfloor containing a billiard-table, a wooden spiral staircase piercing theceiling, wine on the tables, smoke on the walls, candles in broaddaylight,&mdash;this was the style of this cabaret. A staircase with atrap-door in the lower room led to the cellar. On the second floor werethe lodgings of the Hucheloup family. They were reached by a staircasewhich was a ladder rather than a staircase, and had for their entranceonly a private door in the large room on the first floor. Under the roof,in two mansard attics, were the nests for the servants. The kitchen sharedthe ground floor with the tap-room.</p><p>Father Hucheloup had, possibly, been born a chemist, but the fact is thathe was a cook; people did not confine themselves to drinking alone in hiswine-shop, they also ate there. Hucheloup had invented a capital thingwhich could be eaten nowhere but in his house, stuffed carps, which hecalled <i>carpes au gras</i>. These were eaten by the light of a tallow candle orof a lamp of the time of Louis XVI., on tables to which were nailed waxedcloths in lieu of table-cloths. People came thither from a distance.Hucheloup, one fine morning, had seen fit to notify passers-by of this&ldquo;specialty&rdquo;; he had dipped a brush in a pot of black paint, and as he wasan orthographer on his own account, as well as a cook after his ownfashion, he had improvised on his wall this remarkable inscription:&mdash;</p><p class="center">CARPES HO GRAS.</p><p>One winter, the rain-storms and the showers had taken a fancy toobliterate the S which terminated the first word, and the G which beganthe third; this is what remained:&mdash;</p><p class="center">CARPE HO RAS.</p><p>Time and rain assisting, a humble gastronomical announcement had become aprofound piece of advice.</p><p>In this way it came about, that though he knew no French, Father Hucheloupunderstood Latin, that he had evoked philosophy from his kitchen, andthat, desirous simply of effacing Lent, he had equalled Horace. And thestriking thing about it was, that that also meant: &ldquo;Enter my wine-shop.&rdquo;</p><p>Nothing of all this is in existence now. The Mondétour labyrinth wasdisembowelled and widely opened in 1847, and probably no longer exists atthe present moment. The Rue de la Chanvrerie and Corinthe have disappearedbeneath the pavement of the Rue Rambuteau.</p><p>As we have already said, Corinthe was the meeting-place if not therallying-point, of Courfeyrac and his friends. It was Grantaire who haddiscovered Corinthe. He had entered it on account of the <i>Carpe horas</i>, andhad returned thither on account of the <i>Carpes au gras</i>. There they drank,there they ate, there they shouted; they did not pay much, they paidbadly, they did not pay at all, but they were always welcome. FatherHucheloup was a jovial host.</p><p>Hucheloup, that amiable man, as was just said, was a wine-shop-keeper witha moustache; an amusing variety. He always had an ill-tempered air, seemedto wish to intimidate his customers, grumbled at the people who enteredhis establishment, and had rather the mien of seeking a quarrel with themthan of serving them with soup. And yet, we insist upon the word, peoplewere always welcome there. This oddity had attracted customers to hisshop, and brought him young men, who said to each other: &ldquo;Come hear FatherHucheloup growl.&rdquo; He had been a fencing-master. All of a sudden, he wouldburst out laughing. A big voice, a good fellow. He had a comic foundationunder a tragic exterior, he asked nothing better than to frighten you,very much like those snuff-boxes which are in the shape of a pistol. Thedetonation makes one sneeze.</p><p>Mother Hucheloup, his wife, was a bearded and a very homely creature.</p><p>About 1830, Father Hucheloup died. With him disappeared the secret ofstuffed carps. His inconsolable widow continued to keep the wine-shop. Butthe cooking deteriorated, and became execrable; the wine, which had alwaysbeen bad, became fearfully bad. Nevertheless, Courfeyrac and his friendscontinued to go to Corinthe,&mdash;out of pity, as Bossuet said.</p><p>The Widow Hucheloup was breathless and misshapen and given to rusticrecollections. She deprived them of their flatness by her pronunciation.She had a way of her own of saying things, which spiced her reminiscencesof the village and of her springtime. It had formerly been her delight, soshe affirmed, to hear the <i>loups-de-gorge</i> (<i>rouges-gorges</i>) <i>chanter dans lesogrepines</i> (<i>aubépines</i>)&mdash;to hear the redbreasts sing in thehawthorn-trees.</p><p>The hall on the first floor, where &ldquo;the restaurant&rdquo; was situated, was alarge and long apartment encumbered with stools, chairs, benches, andtables, and with a crippled, lame, old billiard-table. It was reached by aspiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a squarehole like the hatchway of a ship.</p><p>This room, lighted by a single narrow window, and by a lamp that wasalways burning, had the air of a garret. All the four-footed furniturecomported itself as though it had but three legs&mdash;the whitewashedwalls had for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of MameHucheloup:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Elle étonne à dix pas, elle épouvente à deux,<br/>Une verrue habite en son nez hasardeux;<br/>On tremble à chaque instant qu&rsquo;elle ne vous la mouche<br/>Et qu&rsquo;un beau jour son nez ne tombe dans sa bouche.<a href="#linknote-48" name="linknoteref-48" id="linknoteref-48">48</a></p><p>This was scrawled in charcoal on the wall.</p><p>Mame Hucheloup, a good likeness, went and came from morning till nightbefore this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity. Twoserving-maids, named Matelote and Gibelotte,<a href="#linknote-49" name="linknoteref-49" id="linknoteref-49">49</a> and who had never beenknown by any other names, helped Mame Hucheloup to set on the tables thejugs of poor wine, and the various broths which were served to the hungrypatrons in earthenware bowls. Matelote, large, plump, redhaired, andnoisy, the favorite ex-sultana of the defunct Hucheloup, was homelier thanany mythological monster, be it what it may; still, as it becomes theservant to always keep in the rear of the mistress, she was less homelythan Mame Hucheloup. Gibelotte, tall, delicate, white with a lymphaticpallor, with circles round her eyes, and drooping lids, always languid andweary, afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude, the first upin the house and the last in bed, waited on every one, even the othermaid, silently and gently, smiling through her fatigue with a vague andsleepy smile.</p><p>Before entering the restaurant room, the visitor read on the door thefollowing line written there in chalk by Courfeyrac:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Régale si tu peux et mange si tu l&rsquo;oses.<a href="#linknote-50" name="linknoteref-50" id="linknoteref-50">50</a></p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0278" id="link2HCH0278"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;PRELIMINARY GAYETIES</h3><p>Laigle de Meaux, as the reader knows, lived more with Joly than elsewhere.He had a lodging, as a bird has one on a branch. The two friends livedtogether, ate together, slept together. They had everything in common,even Musichetta, to some extent. They were, what the subordinate monks whoaccompany monks are called, <i>bini</i>. On the morning of the 5th of June, theywent to Corinthe to breakfast. Joly, who was all stuffed up, had a catarrhwhich Laigle was beginning to share. Laigle&rsquo;s coat was threadbare, butJoly was well dressed.</p><p>It was about nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, when they opened the door ofCorinthe.</p><p>They ascended to the first floor.</p><p>Matelote and Gibelotte received them.</p><p>&ldquo;Oysters, cheese, and ham,&rdquo; said Laigle.</p><p>And they seated themselves at a table.</p><p>The wine-shop was empty; there was no one there but themselves.</p><p>Gibelotte, knowing Joly and Laigle, set a bottle of wine on the table.</p><p>While they were busy with their first oysters, a head appeared at thehatchway of the staircase, and a voice said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am passing by. I smell from the street a delicious odor of Brie cheese.I enter.&rdquo; It was Grantaire.</p><p>Grantaire took a stool and drew up to the table.</p><p>At the sight of Grantaire, Gibelotte placed two bottles of wine on thetable.</p><p>That made three.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going to drink those two bottles?&rdquo; Laigle inquired of Grantaire.</p><p>Grantaire replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;All are ingenious, thou alone art ingenuous. Two bottles never yetastonished a man.&rdquo;</p><p>The others had begun by eating, Grantaire began by drinking. Half a bottlewas rapidly gulped down.</p><p>&ldquo;So you have a hole in your stomach?&rdquo; began Laigle again.</p><p>&ldquo;You have one in your elbow,&rdquo; said Grantaire.</p><p>And after having emptied his glass, he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, by the way, Laigle of the funeral oration, your coat is old.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should hope so,&rdquo; retorted Laigle. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we get on well together,my coat and I. It has acquired all my folds, it does not bind me anywhere,it is moulded on my deformities, it falls in with all my movements, I amonly conscious of it because it keeps me warm. Old coats are just like oldfriends.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; ejaculated Joly, striking into the dialogue, &ldquo;an old goatis an old abi&rdquo; (<i>ami</i>, friend).</p><p>&ldquo;Especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up,&rdquo; saidGrantaire.</p><p>&ldquo;Grantaire,&rdquo; demanded Laigle, &ldquo;have you just come from the boulevard?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have just seen the head of the procession pass, Joly and I.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a marvellous sight,&rdquo; said Joly.</p><p>&ldquo;How quiet this street is!&rdquo; exclaimed Laigle. &ldquo;Who would suspect thatParis was turned upside down? How plainly it is to be seen that in formerdays there were nothing but convents here! In this neighborhood! Du Breuland Sauval give a list of them, and so does the Abbé Lebeuf. They were allround here, they fairly swarmed, booted and barefooted, shaven, bearded,gray, black, white, Franciscans, Minims, Capuchins, Carmelites, LittleAugustines, Great Augustines, old Augustines&mdash;there was no end ofthem.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk of monks,&rdquo; interrupted Grantaire, &ldquo;it makes one want toscratch one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Bouh! I&rsquo;ve just swallowed a bad oyster. Now hypochondria is takingpossession of me again. The oysters are spoiled, the servants are ugly. I hatethe human race. I just passed through the Rue Richelieu, in front of the bigpublic library. That pile of oyster-shells which is called a library isdisgusting even to think of. What paper! What ink! What scrawling! And all thathas been written! What rascal was it who said that man was a featherlessbiped?<a href="#linknote-51" name="linknoteref-51" id="linknoteref-51">51</a>And then, I met a pretty girl of my acquaintance, who is as beautiful as thespring, worthy to be called Floréal, and who is delighted, enraptured, as happyas the angels, because a wretch yesterday, a frightful banker all spotted withsmall-pox, deigned to take a fancy to her! Alas! woman keeps on the watch for aprotector as much as for a lover; cats chase mice as well as birds. Two monthsago that young woman was virtuous in an attic, she adjusted little brass ringsin the eyelet-holes of corsets, what do you call it? She sewed, she had a campbed, she dwelt beside a pot of flowers, she was contented. Now here she is abankeress. This transformation took place last night. I met the victim thismorning in high spirits. The hideous point about it is, that the jade is aspretty to-day as she was yesterday. Her financier did not show in her face.Roses have this advantage or disadvantage over women, that the traces left uponthem by caterpillars are visible. Ah! there is no morality on earth. I call towitness the myrtle, the symbol of love, the laurel, the symbol of air, theolive, that ninny, the symbol of peace, the apple-tree which came nearestrangling Adam with its pips, and the fig-tree, the grandfather of petticoats.As for right, do you know what right is? The Gauls covet Clusium, Rome protectsClusium, and demands what wrong Clusium has done to them. Brennus answers:&lsquo;The wrong that Alba did to you, the wrong that Fidenæ did to you, thewrong that the Eques, the Volsci, and the Sabines have done to you. They wereyour neighbors. The Clusians are ours. We understand neighborliness just as youdo. You have stolen Alba, we shall take Clusium.&rsquo; Rome said: &lsquo;Youshall not take Clusium.&rsquo; Brennus took Rome. Then he cried: &lsquo;Vævictis!&rsquo; That is what right is. Ah! what beasts of prey there are in thisworld! What eagles! It makes my flesh creep.&rdquo;</p><p>He held out his glass to Joly, who filled it, then he drank and went on,having hardly been interrupted by this glass of wine, of which no one, noteven himself, had taken any notice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Brennus, who takes Rome, is an eagle; the banker who takes the grisetteis an eagle. There is no more modesty in the one case than in the other.So we believe in nothing. There is but one reality: drink. Whatever youropinion may be in favor of the lean cock, like the Canton of Uri, or infavor of the fat cock, like the Canton of Glaris, it matters little,drink. You talk to me of the boulevard, of that procession, <i>et cætera, etcætera</i>. Come now, is there going to be another revolution? This povertyof means on the part of the good God astounds me. He has to keep greasingthe groove of events every moment. There is a hitch, it won&rsquo;t work. Quick,a revolution! The good God has his hands perpetually black with thatcart-grease. If I were in his place, I&rsquo;d be perfectly simple about it, Iwould not wind up my mechanism every minute, I&rsquo;d lead the human race in astraightforward way, I&rsquo;d weave matters mesh by mesh, without breaking thethread, I would have no provisional arrangements, I would have noextraordinary repertory. What the rest of you call progress advances bymeans of two motors, men and events. But, sad to say, from time to time,the exceptional becomes necessary. The ordinary troupe suffices neitherfor event nor for men: among men geniuses are required, among eventsrevolutions. Great accidents are the law; the order of things cannot dowithout them; and, judging from the apparition of comets, one would betempted to think that Heaven itself finds actors needed for itsperformance. At the moment when one expects it the least, God placards ameteor on the wall of the firmament. Some queer star turns up, underlinedby an enormous tail. And that causes the death of Cæsar. Brutus deals hima blow with a knife, and God a blow with a comet. <i>Crac</i>, and behold anaurora borealis, behold a revolution, behold a great man; &rsquo;93 in bigletters, Napoleon on guard, the comet of 1811 at the head of the poster.Ah! what a beautiful blue theatre all studded with unexpected flashes!Boum! Boum! extraordinary show! Raise your eyes, boobies. Everything is indisorder, the star as well as the drama. Good God, it is too much and notenough. These resources, gathered from exception, seem magnificence andpoverty. My friends, Providence has come down to expedients. What does arevolution prove? That God is in a quandry. He effects a <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i>because he, God, has not been able to make both ends meet. In fact, thisconfirms me in my conjectures as to Jehovah&rsquo;s fortune; and when I see somuch distress in heaven and on earth, from the bird who has not a grain ofmillet to myself without a hundred thousand livres of income, when I seehuman destiny, which is very badly worn, and even royal destiny, which isthreadbare, witness the Prince de Condé hung, when I see winter, which isnothing but a rent in the zenith through which the wind blows, when I seeso many rags even in the perfectly new purple of the morning on the crestsof hills, when I see the drops of dew, those mock pearls, when I see thefrost, that paste, when I see humanity ripped apart and events patched up,and so many spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon, when I see somuch misery everywhere, I suspect that God is not rich. The appearanceexists, it is true, but I feel that he is hard up. He gives a revolutionas a tradesman whose money-box is empty gives a ball. God must not bejudged from appearances. Beneath the gilding of heaven I perceive apoverty-stricken universe. Creation is bankrupt. That is why I amdiscontented. Here it is the 4th of June, it is almost night; ever sincethis morning I have been waiting for daylight to come; it has not come,and I bet that it won&rsquo;t come all day. This is the inexactness of anill-paid clerk. Yes, everything is badly arranged, nothing fits anythingelse, this old world is all warped, I take my stand on the opposition,everything goes awry; the universe is a tease. It&rsquo;s like children, thosewho want them have none, and those who don&rsquo;t want them have them. Total:I&rsquo;m vexed. Besides, Laigle de Meaux, that bald-head, offends my sight. Ithumiliates me to think that I am of the same age as that baldy. However, Icriticise, but I do not insult. The universe is what it is. I speak herewithout evil intent and to ease my conscience. Receive, Eternal Father,the assurance of my distinguished consideration. Ah! by all the saints ofOlympus and by all the gods of paradise, I was not intended to be aParisian, that is to say, to rebound forever, like a shuttlecock betweentwo battledores, from the group of the loungers to the group of theroysterers. I was made to be a Turk, watching oriental houris all daylong, executing those exquisite Egyptian dances, as sensuous as the dreamof a chaste man, or a Beauceron peasant, or a Venetian gentlemansurrounded by gentlewoman, or a petty German prince, furnishing the halfof a foot-soldier to the Germanic confederation, and occupying his leisurewith drying his breeches on his hedge, that is to say, his frontier. Thoseare the positions for which I was born! Yes, I have said a Turk, and Iwill not retract. I do not understand how people can habitually take Turksin bad part; Mohammed had his good points; respect for the inventor ofseraglios with houris and paradises with odalisques! Let us not insultMohammedanism, the only religion which is ornamented with a hen-roost!Now, I insist on a drink. The earth is a great piece of stupidity. And itappears that they are going to fight, all those imbeciles, and to breakeach other&rsquo;s profiles and to massacre each other in the heart of summer,in the month of June, when they might go off with a creature on their arm,to breathe the immense heaps of new-mown hay in the meadows! Really,people do commit altogether too many follies. An old broken lantern whichI have just seen at a bric-à-brac merchant&rsquo;s suggests a reflection to mymind; it is time to enlighten the human race. Yes, behold me sad again.That&rsquo;s what comes of swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong way!I am growing melancholy once more. Oh! frightful old world. People strive,turn each other out, prostitute themselves, kill each other, and get usedto it!&rdquo;</p><p>And Grantaire, after this fit of eloquence, had a fit of coughing, whichwas well earned.</p><p>&ldquo;À propos of revolution,&rdquo; said Joly, &ldquo;it is decidedly abberent that Bariusis in lub.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Does any one know with whom?&rdquo; demanded Laigle.</p><p>&ldquo;Do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do! I tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Marius&rsquo; love affairs!&rdquo; exclaimed Grantaire. &ldquo;I can imagine it. Marius isa fog, and he must have found a vapor. Marius is of the race of poets. Hewho says poet, says fool, madman, <i>Tymbræus Apollo</i>. Marius and his Marie,or his Marion, or his Maria, or his Mariette. They must make a queer pairof lovers. I know just what it is like. Ecstasies in which they forget tokiss. Pure on earth, but joined in heaven. They are souls possessed ofsenses. They lie among the stars.&rdquo;</p><p>Grantaire was attacking his second bottle and, possibly, his secondharangue, when a new personage emerged from the square aperture of thestairs. It was a boy less than ten years of age, ragged, very small,yellow, with an odd phiz, a vivacious eye, an enormous amount of hairdrenched with rain, and wearing a contented air.</p><p>The child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three, addressedhimself to Laigle de Meaux.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you Monsieur Bossuet?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is my nickname,&rdquo; replied Laigle. &ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This. A tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me: &lsquo;Do you knowMother Hucheloup?&rsquo; I said: &lsquo;Yes, Rue Chanvrerie, the old man&rsquo;s widow;&rsquo; hesaid to me: &lsquo;Go there. There you will find M. Bossuet. Tell him from me:&ldquo;A B C&rdquo;.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a joke that they&rsquo;re playing on you, isn&rsquo;t it. He gave meten sous.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Joly, lend me ten sous,&rdquo; said Laigle; and, turning to Grantaire:&ldquo;Grantaire, lend me ten sous.&rdquo;</p><p>This made twenty sous, which Laigle handed to the lad.</p><p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the urchin.</p><p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; inquired Laigle.</p><p>&ldquo;Navet, Gavroche&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Stay with us,&rdquo; said Laigle.</p><p>&ldquo;Breakfast with us,&rdquo; said Grantaire.</p><p>The child replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, I belong in the procession, I&rsquo;m the one to shout &lsquo;Down withPolignac!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>And executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him, which is the mostrespectful of all possible salutes, he took his departure.</p><p>The child gone, Grantaire took the word:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;That is the pure-bred gamin. There are a great many varieties of thegamin species. The notary&rsquo;s gamin is called Skip-the-Gutter, the cook&rsquo;sgamin is called a scullion, the baker&rsquo;s gamin is called a <i>mitron</i>, thelackey&rsquo;s gamin is called a groom, the marine gamin is called thecabin-boy, the soldier&rsquo;s gamin is called the drummer-boy, the painter&rsquo;sgamin is called paint-grinder, the tradesman&rsquo;s gamin is called anerrand-boy, the courtesan gamin is called the minion, the kingly gamin iscalled the dauphin, the god gamin is called the bambino.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, Laigle was engaged in reflection; he said half aloud:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;A B C, that is to say: the burial of Lamarque.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The tall blonde,&rdquo; remarked Grantaire, &ldquo;is Enjolras, who is sending you awarning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo; ejaculated Bossuet.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s raiding,&rdquo; said Joly. &ldquo;I have sworn to go through fire, but notthrough water. I don&rsquo;t wand to ged a gold.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I shall stay here,&rdquo; said Grantaire. &ldquo;I prefer a breakfast to a hearse.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Conclusion: we remain,&rdquo; said Laigle. &ldquo;Well, then, let us drink. Besides,we might miss the funeral without missing the riot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! the riot, I am with you!&rdquo; cried Joly.</p><p>Laigle rubbed his hands.</p><p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re going to touch up the revolution of 1830. As a matter of fact,it does hurt the people along the seams.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of your revolution,&rdquo; said Grantaire. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t execratethis Government. It is the crown tempered by the cotton night-cap. It is asceptre ending in an umbrella. In fact, I think that to-day, with thepresent weather, Louis Philippe might utilize his royalty in twodirections, he might extend the tip of the sceptre end against the people,and open the umbrella end against heaven.&rdquo;</p><p>The room was dark, large clouds had just finished the extinction ofdaylight. There was no one in the wine-shop, or in the street, every onehaving gone off &ldquo;to watch events.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it midday or midnight?&rdquo; cried Bossuet. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see your handbefore your face. Gibelotte, fetch a light.&rdquo;</p><p>Grantaire was drinking in a melancholy way.</p><p>&ldquo;Enjolras disdains me,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Enjolras said: &lsquo;Joly is ill,Grantaire is drunk.&rsquo; It was to Bossuet that he sent Navet. If he had comefor me, I would have followed him. So much the worse for Enjolras! I won&rsquo;tgo to his funeral.&rdquo;</p><p>This resolution once arrived at, Bossuet, Joly, and Grantaire did not stirfrom the wine-shop. By two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, the table at whichthey sat was covered with empty bottles. Two candles were burning on it,one in a flat copper candlestick which was perfectly green, the other inthe neck of a cracked carafe. Grantaire had seduced Joly and Bossuet towine; Bossuet and Joly had conducted Grantaire back towards cheerfulness.</p><p>As for Grantaire, he had got beyond wine, that merely moderate inspirer ofdreams, ever since midday. Wine enjoys only a conventional popularitywith serious drinkers. There is, in fact, in the matter of inebriety,white magic and black magic; wine is only white magic. Grantaire was adaring drinker of dreams. The blackness of a terrible fit of drunkennessyawning before him, far from arresting him, attracted him. He hadabandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass. The beer-glass is theabyss. Having neither opium nor hashish on hand, and being desirous offilling his brain with twilight, he had had recourse to that fearfulmixture of brandy, stout, absinthe, which produces the most terrible oflethargies. It is of these three vapors, beer, brandy, and absinthe, thatthe lead of the soul is composed. They are three grooms; the celestialbutterfly is drowned in them; and there are formed there in a membranoussmoke, vaguely condensed into the wing of the bat, three mute furies,Nightmare, Night, and Death, which hover about the slumbering Psyche.</p><p>Grantaire had not yet reached that lamentable phase; far from it. He wastremendously gay, and Bossuet and Joly retorted. They clinked glasses.Grantaire added to the eccentric accentuation of words and ideas, apeculiarity of gesture; he rested his left fist on his knee with dignity,his arm forming a right angle, and, with cravat untied, seated astride astool, his full glass in his right hand, he hurled solemn words at the bigmaid-servant Matelote:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Let the doors of the palace be thrown open! Let every one be a member ofthe French Academy and have the right to embrace Madame Hucheloup. Let usdrink.&rdquo;</p><p>And turning to Madame Hucheloup, he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Woman ancient and consecrated by use, draw near that I may contemplatethee!&rdquo;</p><p>And Joly exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Matelote and Gibelotte, dod&rsquo;t gib Grantaire anything more to drink. Hehas already devoured, since this bording, in wild prodigality, two francsand ninety-five centibes.&rdquo;</p><p>And Grantaire began again:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Who has been unhooking the stars without my permission, and putting themon the table in the guise of candles?&rdquo;</p><p>Bossuet, though very drunk, preserved his equanimity.</p><p>He was seated on the sill of the open window, wetting his back in thefalling rain, and gazing at his two friends.</p><p>All at once, he heard a tumult behind him, hurried footsteps, cries of &ldquo;Toarms!&rdquo; He turned round and saw in the Rue Saint-Denis, at the end of theRue de la Chanvrerie, Enjolras passing, gun in hand, and Gavroche with hispistol, Feuilly with his sword, Courfeyrac with his sword, and JeanProuvaire with his blunderbuss, Combeferre with his gun, Bahorel with hisgun, and the whole armed and stormy rabble which was following them.</p><p>The Rue de la Chanvrerie was not more than a gunshot long. Bossuetimprovised a speaking-trumpet from his two hands placed around his mouth,and shouted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Courfeyrac! Courfeyrac! Hohée!&rdquo;</p><p>Courfeyrac heard the shout, caught sight of Bossuet, and advanced a fewpaces into the Rue de la Chanvrerie, shouting: &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; whichcrossed a &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To make a barricade,&rdquo; replied Courfeyrac.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, here! This is a good place! Make it here!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Aigle,&rdquo; said Courfeyrac.</p><p>And at a signal from Courfeyrac, the mob flung themselves into the Rue dela Chanvrerie.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0279" id="link2HCH0279"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;NIGHT BEGINS TO DESCEND UPON GRANTAIRE</h3><p>The spot was, in fact, admirably adapted, the entrance to the streetwidened out, the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket withoutexit. Corinthe created an obstacle, the Rue Mondétour was easilybarricaded on the right and the left, no attack was possible except fromthe Rue Saint-Denis, that is to say, in front, and in full sight. Bossuethad the comprehensive glance of a fasting Hannibal.</p><p>Terror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob. Therewas not a passer-by who did not get out of sight. In the space of a flashof lightning, in the rear, to right and left, shops, stables, area-doors,windows, blinds, attic skylights, shutters of every description wereclosed, from the ground floor to the roof. A terrified old woman fixed amattress in front of her window on two clothes-poles for drying linen, inorder to deaden the effect of musketry. The wine-shop alone remained open;and that for a very good reason, that the mob had rushed into it.&mdash;&ldquo;Ahmy God! Ah my God!&rdquo; sighed Mame Hucheloup.</p><p>Bossuet had gone down to meet Courfeyrac.</p><p>Joly, who had placed himself at the window, exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Courfeyrac, you ought to have brought an umbrella. You will gatch gold.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meantime, in the space of a few minutes, twenty iron bars had beenwrenched from the grated front of the wine-shop, ten fathoms of street hadbeen unpaved; Gavroche and Bahorel had seized in its passage, andoverturned, the dray of a lime-dealer named Anceau; this dray containedthree barrels of lime, which they placed beneath the piles ofpaving-stones: Enjolras raised the cellar trap, and all the widowHucheloup&rsquo;s empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime; Feuilly,with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of fans, hadbacked up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks ofrough stone. Blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured noone knows where. The beams which served as props were torn from theneighboring house-fronts and laid on the casks. When Bossuet andCourfeyrac turned round, half the street was already barred with a ramparthigher than a man. There is nothing like the hand of the populace forbuilding everything that is built by demolishing.</p><p>Matelote and Gibelotte had mingled with the workers. Gibelotte went andcame loaded with rubbish. Her lassitude helped on the barricade. Sheserved the barricade as she would have served wine, with a sleepy air.</p><p>An omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street.</p><p>Bossuet strode over the paving-stones, ran to it, stopped the driver, madethe passengers alight, offered his hand to &ldquo;the ladies,&rdquo; dismissed theconductor, and returned, leading the vehicle and the horses by the bridle.</p><p>&ldquo;Omnibuses,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do not pass the Corinthe. <i>Non licet omnibus adireCorinthum</i>.&rdquo;</p><p>An instant later, the horses were unharnessed and went off at their will,through the Rue Mondétour, and the omnibus lying on its side completed thebar across the street.</p><p>Mame Hucheloup, quite upset, had taken refuge in the first story.</p><p>Her eyes were vague, and stared without seeing anything, and she cried ina low tone. Her terrified shrieks did not dare to emerge from her throat.</p><p>&ldquo;The end of the world has come,&rdquo; she muttered.</p><p>Joly deposited a kiss on Mame Hucheloup&rsquo;s fat, red, wrinkled neck, andsaid to Grantaire: &ldquo;My dear fellow, I have always regarded a woman&rsquo;s neckas an infinitely delicate thing.&rdquo;</p><p>But Grantaire attained to the highest regions of dithryamb. Matelote hadmounted to the first floor once more, Grantaire seized her round herwaist, and gave vent to long bursts of laughter at the window.</p><p>&ldquo;Matelote is homely!&rdquo; he cried: &ldquo;Matelote is of a dream of ugliness!Matelote is a chimæra. This is the secret of her birth: a GothicPygmalion, who was making gargoyles for cathedrals, fell in love with oneof them, the most horrible, one fine morning. He besought Love to give itlife, and this produced Matelote. Look at her, citizens! She haschromate-of-lead-colored hair, like Titian&rsquo;s mistress, and she is a goodgirl. I guarantee that she will fight well. Every good girl contains ahero. As for Mother Hucheloup, she&rsquo;s an old warrior. Look at hermoustaches! She inherited them from her husband. A hussar indeed! She willfight too. These two alone will strike terror to the heart of thebanlieue. Comrades, we shall overthrow the government as true as there arefifteen intermediary acids between margaric acid and formic acid; however,that is a matter of perfect indifference to me. Gentlemen, my fatheralways detested me because I could not understand mathematics. Iunderstand only love and liberty. I am Grantaire, the good fellow. Havingnever had any money, I never acquired the habit of it, and the result isthat I have never lacked it; but, if I had been rich, there would havebeen no more poor people! You would have seen! Oh, if the kind hearts onlyhad fat purses, how much better things would go! I picture myself JesusChrist with Rothschild&rsquo;s fortune! How much good he would do! Matelote,embrace me! You are voluptuous and timid! You have cheeks which invite thekiss of a sister, and lips which claim the kiss of a lover.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, you cask!&rdquo; said Courfeyrac.</p><p>Grantaire retorted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I am the capitoul<a href="#linknote-52" name="linknoteref-52" id="linknoteref-52">52</a>and the master of the floral games!&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras, who was standing on the crest of the barricade, gun in hand,raised his beautiful, austere face. Enjolras, as the reader knows, hadsomething of the Spartan and of the Puritan in his composition. He wouldhave perished at Thermopylæ with Leonidas, and burned at Drogheda withCromwell.</p><p>&ldquo;Grantaire,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;go get rid of the fumes of your wine somewhereelse than here. This is the place for enthusiasm, not for drunkenness.Don&rsquo;t disgrace the barricade!&rdquo;</p><p>This angry speech produced a singular effect on Grantaire. One would havesaid that he had had a glass of cold water flung in his face. He seemed tobe rendered suddenly sober.</p><p>He sat down, put his elbows on a table near the window, looked at Enjolraswith indescribable gentleness, and said to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me sleep here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go and sleep somewhere else,&rdquo; cried Enjolras.</p><p>But Grantaire, still keeping his tender and troubled eyes fixed on him,replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me sleep here,&mdash;until I die.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras regarded him with disdainful eyes:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Grantaire, you are incapable of believing, of thinking, of willing, ofliving, and of dying.&rdquo;</p><p>Grantaire replied in a grave tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You will see.&rdquo;</p><p>He stammered a few more unintelligible words, then his head fell heavilyon the table, and, as is the usual effect of the second period ofinebriety, into which Enjolras had roughly and abruptly thrust him, aninstant later he had fallen asleep.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0280" id="link2HCH0280"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;AN ATTEMPT TO CONSOLE THE WIDOW HUCHELOUP</h3><p>Bahorel, in ecstasies over the barricade, shouted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the street in its low-necked dress!

Ah! good Heavens, are you going to putthat table of mine in your horror, too? And it was for the counterpane,and also for a pot of flowers which fell from the attic window into thestreet, that the government collected a fine of a hundred francs. If thatisn&rsquo;t an abomination, what is!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, Mother Hucheloup, we are avenging you.&rdquo;</p><p>Mother Hucheloup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefitwhich she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account. She wassatisfied after the manner of that Arab woman, who, having received a boxon the ear from her husband, went to complain to her father, and cried forvengeance, saying: &ldquo;Father, you owe my husband affront for affront.&rdquo; Thefather asked: &ldquo;On which cheek did you receive the blow?&rdquo; &ldquo;On the leftcheek.&rdquo; The father slapped her right cheek and said: &ldquo;Now you aresatisfied. Go tell your husband that he boxed my daughter&rsquo;s ears, and thatI have accordingly boxed his wife&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p><p>The rain had ceased. Recruits had arrived. Workmen had brought under theirblouses a barrel of powder, a basket containing bottles of vitriol, two orthree carnival torches, and a basket filled with fire-pots, &ldquo;left overfrom the King&rsquo;s festival.&rdquo; This festival was very recent, having takenplace on the 1st of May. It was said that these munitions came from agrocer in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine named Pépin. They smashed the onlystreet lantern in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the lantern corresponding toone in the Rue Saint-Denis, and all the lanterns in the surroundingstreets, de Mondétour, du Cygne, des Prêcheurs, and de la Grande and de laPetite-Truanderie.</p><p>Enjolras, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac directed everything. Two barricadeswere now in process of construction at once, both of them resting on theCorinthe house and forming a right angle; the larger shut off the Rue dela Chanvrerie, the other closed the Rue Mondétour, on the side of the Ruede Cygne. This last barricade, which was very narrow, was constructed onlyof casks and paving-stones. There were about fifty workers on it; thirtywere armed with guns; for, on their way, they had effected a wholesaleloan from an armorer&rsquo;s shop.</p><p>Nothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than thistroop. One had a round-jacket, a cavalry sabre, and two holster-pistols,another was in his shirt-sleeves, with a round hat, and a powder-hornslung at his side, a third wore a plastron of nine sheets of gray paperand was armed with a saddler&rsquo;s awl. There was one who was shouting: &ldquo;Letus exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of our bayonet.&rdquo; This man had no bayonet. Another spread out over his coat the cross-beltand cartridge-box of a National Guardsman, the cover of the cartridge-boxbeing ornamented with this inscription in red worsted: <i>Public Order</i>. Therewere a great many guns bearing the numbers of the legions, few hats, nocravats, many bare arms, some pikes. Add to this, all ages, all sorts offaces, small, pale young men, and bronzed longshoremen. All were in haste;and as they helped each other, they discussed the possible chances. Thatthey would receive succor about three o&rsquo;clock in the morning&mdash;thatthey were sure of one regiment, that Paris would rise. Terrible sayingswith which was mingled a sort of cordial joviality. One would havepronounced them brothers, but they did not know each other&rsquo;s names. Greatperils have this fine characteristic, that they bring to light thefraternity of strangers. A fire had been lighted in the kitchen, and therethey were engaged in moulding into bullets, pewter mugs, spoons, forks,and all the brass table-ware of the establishment. In the midst of it all,they drank. Caps and buckshot were mixed pell-mell on the tables withglasses of wine. In the billiard-hall, Mame Hucheloup, Matelote, andGibelotte, variously modified by terror, which had stupefied one, renderedanother breathless, and roused the third, were tearing up old dish-clothsand making lint; three insurgents were assisting them, three bushy-haired,jolly blades with beards and moustaches, who plucked away at the linenwith the fingers of seamstresses and who made them tremble.</p><p>The man of lofty stature whom Courfeyrac, Combeferre, and Enjolras hadobserved at the moment when he joined the mob at the corner of the Rue desBillettes, was at work on the smaller barricade and was making himselfuseful there. Gavroche was working on the larger one. As for the young manwho had been waiting for Courfeyrac at his lodgings, and who had inquiredfor M. Marius, he had disappeared at about the time when the omnibus hadbeen overturned.</p><p>Gavroche, completely carried away and radiant, had undertaken to geteverything in readiness. He went, came, mounted, descended, re-mounted,whistled, and sparkled. He seemed to be there for the encouragement ofall. Had he any incentive? Yes, certainly, his poverty; had he wings? yes,certainly, his joy. Gavroche was a whirlwind. He was constantly visible,he was incessantly audible. He filled the air, as he was everywhere atonce. He was a sort of almost irritating ubiquity; no halt was possiblewith him. The enormous barricade felt him on its haunches. He troubled theloungers, he excited the idle, he reanimated the weary, he grew impatientover the thoughtful, he inspired gayety in some, and breath in others,wrath in others, movement in all, now pricking a student, now biting anartisan; he alighted, paused, flew off again, hovered over the tumult, andthe effort, sprang from one party to another, murmuring and humming, andharassed the whole company; a fly on the immense revolutionary coach.</p><p>Perpetual motion was in his little arms and perpetual clamor in his littlelungs.</p><p>&ldquo;Courage! more paving-stones! more casks! more machines! Where are younow? A hod of plaster for me to stop this hole with! Your barricade isvery small. It must be carried up. Put everything on it, fling everythingthere, stick it all in. Break down the house. A barricade is MotherGibou&rsquo;s tea. Hullo, here&rsquo;s a glass door.&rdquo;</p><p>This elicited an exclamation from the workers.</p><p>&ldquo;A glass door? what do you expect us to do with a glass door, tubercle?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hercules yourselves!&rdquo; retorted Gavroche. &ldquo;A glass door is an excellentthing in a barricade. It does not prevent an attack, but it prevents theenemy taking it. So you&rsquo;ve never prigged apples over a wall where therewere broken bottles? A glass door cuts the corns of the National Guardwhen they try to mount on the barricade. Pardi! glass is a treacherousthing. Well, you haven&rsquo;t a very wildly lively imagination, comrades.&rdquo;</p><p>However, he was furious over his triggerless pistol. He went from one toanother, demanding: &ldquo;A gun, I want a gun! Why don&rsquo;t you give me a gun?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give you a gun!&rdquo; said Combeferre.</p><p>&ldquo;Come now!&rdquo; said Gavroche, &ldquo;why not? I had one in 1830 when we had adispute with Charles X.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;When there are enough for the men, we will give some to the children.&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche wheeled round haughtily, and answered:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;If you are killed before me, I shall take yours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gamin!&rdquo; said Enjolras.</p><p>&ldquo;Greenhorn!&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>A dandy who had lost his way and who lounged past the end of the streetcreated a diversion! Gavroche shouted to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Come with us, young fellow! well now, don&rsquo;t we do anything for this oldcountry of ours?&rdquo;</p><p>The dandy fled.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0281" id="link2HCH0281"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;PREPARATIONS</h3><p>The journals of the day which said that that <i>nearly impregnable structure</i>,of the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, as they call it, reached tothe level of the first floor, were mistaken. The fact is, that it did notexceed an average height of six or seven feet. It was built in such amanner that the combatants could, at their will, either disappear behindit or dominate the barrier and even scale its crest by means of aquadruple row of paving-stones placed on top of each other and arranged assteps in the interior. On the outside, the front of the barricade,composed of piles of paving-stones and casks bound together by beams andplanks, which were entangled in the wheels of Anceau&rsquo;s dray and of theoverturned omnibus, had a bristling and inextricable aspect.</p><p>An aperture large enough to allow a man to pass through had been madebetween the wall of the houses and the extremity of the barricade whichwas furthest from the wine-shop, so that an exit was possible at thispoint. The pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with ropes,and a red flag, fastened to this pole, floated over the barricade.</p><p>The little Mondétour barricade, hidden behind the wine-shop building, wasnot visible. The two barricades united formed a veritable redoubt.Enjolras and Courfeyrac had not thought fit to barricade the otherfragment of the Rue Mondétour which opens through the Rue des Prêcheurs anissue into the Halles, wishing, no doubt, to preserve a possiblecommunication with the outside, and not entertaining much fear of anattack through the dangerous and difficult street of the Rue desPrêcheurs.</p><p>With the exception of this issue which was left free, and whichconstituted what Folard in his strategical style would have termed abranch and taking into account, also, the narrow cutting arranged on theRue de la Chanvrerie, the interior of the barricade, where the wine-shopformed a salient angle, presented an irregular square, closed on allsides. There existed an interval of twenty paces between the grand barrierand the lofty houses which formed the background of the street, so thatone might say that the barricade rested on these houses, all inhabited,but closed from top to bottom.</p><p>All this work was performed without any hindrance, in less than an hour,and without this handful of bold men seeing a single bear-skin cap or asingle bayonet make their appearance. The very bourgeois who stillventured at this hour of riot to enter the Rue Saint-Denis cast a glanceat the Rue de la Chanvrerie, caught sight of the barricade, and redoubledtheir pace.</p><p>The two barricades being finished, and the flag run up, a table wasdragged out of the wine-shop; and Courfeyrac mounted on the table.Enjolras brought the square coffer, and Courfeyrac opened it. This cofferwas filled with cartridges. When the mob saw the cartridges, a tremor ranthrough the bravest, and a momentary silence ensued.</p><p>Courfeyrac distributed them with a smile.</p><p>Each one received thirty cartridges. Many had powder, and set about makingothers with the bullets which they had run. As for the barrel of powder,it stood on a table on one side, near the door, and was held in reserve.</p><p>The alarm beat which ran through all Paris, did not cease, but it hadfinally come to be nothing more than a monotonous noise to which they nolonger paid any attention. This noise retreated at times, and again drewnear, with melancholy undulations.</p><p>They loaded the guns and carbines, all together, without haste, withsolemn gravity. Enjolras went and stationed three sentinels outside thebarricades, one in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the second in the Rue desPrêcheurs, the third at the corner of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie.</p><p>Then, the barricades having been built, the posts assigned, the gunsloaded, the sentinels stationed, they waited, alone in those redoubtablestreets through which no one passed any longer, surrounded by those dumbhouses which seemed dead and in which no human movement palpitated,enveloped in the deepening shades of twilight which was drawing on, in themidst of that silence through which something could be felt advancing, andwhich had about it something tragic and terrifying, isolated, armed,determined, and tranquil.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0282" id="link2HCH0282"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;WAITING</h3><p>During those hours of waiting, what did they do?</p><p>We must needs tell, since this is a matter of history.</p><p>While the men made bullets and the women lint, while a large saucepan ofmelted brass and lead, destined to the bullet-mould smoked over a glowingbrazier, while the sentinels watched, weapon in hand, on the barricade,while Enjolras, whom it was impossible to divert, kept an eye on thesentinels, Combeferre, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly, Bossuet, Joly,Bahorel, and some others, sought each other out and united as in the mostpeaceful days of their conversations in their student life, and, in onecorner of this wine-shop which had been converted into a casement, acouple of paces distant from the redoubt which they had built, with theircarbines loaded and primed resting against the backs of their chairs,these fine young fellows, so close to a supreme hour, began to recite loveverses.</p><p>What verses?

All that they heard wasconfused noises, and at intervals, fusillades; but these were rare, badlysustained and distant. This respite, which was thus prolonged, was a signthat the Government was taking its time, and collecting its forces. Thesefifty men were waiting for sixty thousand.</p><p>Enjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on strong souls onthe threshold of redoubtable events. He went in search of Gavroche, whohad set to making cartridges in the tap-room, by the dubious light of twocandles placed on the counter by way of precaution, on account of thepowder which was scattered on the tables. These two candles cast no gleamoutside. The insurgents had, moreover, taken pains not to have any lightin the upper stories.</p><p>Gavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment, but not precisely with hiscartridges. The man of the Rue des Billettes had just entered the tap-roomand had seated himself at the table which was the least lighted. A musketof large model had fallen to his share, and he held it between his legs.Gavroche, who had been, up to that moment, distracted by a hundred&ldquo;amusing&rdquo; things, had not even seen this man.</p><p>When he entered, Gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes,admiring his gun; then, all at once, when the man was seated, the streeturchin sprang to his feet. Any one who had spied upon that man up to thatmoment, would have seen that he was observing everything in the barricadeand in the band of insurgents, with singular attention; but, from themoment when he had entered this room, he had fallen into a sort of brownstudy, and no longer seemed to see anything that was going on. The gaminapproached this pensive personage, and began to step around him on tiptoe,as one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one is afraid of waking. Atthe same time, over his childish countenance which was, at once soimpudent and so serious, so giddy and so profound, so gay and soheart-breaking, passed all those grimaces of an old man which signify: Ahbah! impossible! My sight is bad! I am dreaming! can this be? no, it isnot! but yes! why, no! etc. Gavroche balanced on his heels, clenched bothfists in his pockets, moved his neck around like a bird, expended in agigantic pout all the sagacity of his lower lip. He was astounded,uncertain, incredulous, convinced, dazzled. He had the mien of the chiefof the eunuchs in the slave mart, discovering a Venus among the blowsyfemales, and the air of an amateur recognizing a Raphael in a heap ofdaubs. His whole being was at work, the instinct which scents out, and theintelligence which combines. It was evident that a great event hadhappened in Gavroche&rsquo;s life.</p><p>It was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that Enjolrasaccosted him.</p><p>&ldquo;You are small,&rdquo; said Enjolras, &ldquo;you will not be seen. Go out of thebarricade, slip along close to the houses, skirmish about a bit in thestreets, and come back and tell me what is going on.&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche raised himself on his haunches.</p><p>&ldquo;So the little chaps are good for something! that&rsquo;s very lucky! I&rsquo;ll go!In the meanwhile, trust to the little fellows, and distrust the big ones.&rdquo; And Gavroche, raising his head and lowering his voice, added, as heindicated the man of the Rue des Billettes: &ldquo;Do you see that big fellowthere?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a police spy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sure of it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the Port Royal,where I was taking the air, by my ear.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very lowtone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at hand. Theman left the room, and returned almost immediately, accompanied by threeothers. The four men, four porters with broad shoulders, went and placedthemselves without doing anything to attract his attention, behind thetable on which the man of the Rue des Billettes was leaning with hiselbows. They were evidently ready to hurl themselves upon him.</p><p>Then Enjolras approached the man and demanded of him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>At this abrupt query, the man started. He plunged his gaze deep intoEnjolras&rsquo; clear eyes and appeared to grasp the latter&rsquo;s meaning. He smiledwith a smile than which nothing more disdainful, more energetic, and moreresolute could be seen in the world, and replied with haughty gravity:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I see what it is. Well, yes!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are a police spy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am an agent of the authorities.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And your name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Javert.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras made a sign to the four men. In the twinkling of an eye, beforeJavert had time to turn round, he was collared, thrown down, pinioned andsearched.</p><p>They found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces of glass,and bearing on one side the arms of France, engraved, and with this motto:<i>Supervision and vigilance</i>, and on the other this note: &ldquo;JAVERT, inspectorof police, aged fifty-two,&rdquo; and the signature of the Prefect of Police ofthat day, M. Gisquet.</p><p>Besides this, he had his watch and his purse, which contained several goldpieces. They left him his purse and his watch. Under the watch, at thebottom of his fob, they felt and seized a paper in an envelope, whichEnjolras unfolded, and on which he read these five lines, written in thevery hand of the Prefect of Police:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;As soon as his political mission is accomplished, Inspector Javert willmake sure, by special supervision, whether it is true that the malefactorshave instituted intrigues on the right bank of the Seine, near the Jenabridge.&rdquo;</p><p>The search ended, they lifted Javert to his feet, bound his arms behindhis back, and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of theroom which had formerly given the wine-shop its name.</p><p>Gavroche, who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approved ofeverything with a silent toss of his head, stepped up to Javert and saidto him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the mouse who has caught the cat.&rdquo;</p><p>All this was so rapidly executed, that it was all over when those aboutthe wine-shop noticed it.</p><p>Javert had not uttered a single cry.</p><p>At the sight of Javert bound to the post, Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly,Combeferre, and the men scattered over the two barricades came running up.</p><p>Javert, with his back to the post, and so surrounded with ropes that hecould not make a movement, raised his head with the intrepid serenity ofthe man who has never lied.</p><p>&ldquo;He is a police spy,&rdquo; said Enjolras.</p><p>And turning to Javert: &ldquo;You will be shot ten minutes before the barricadeis taken.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert replied in his most imperious tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not at once?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We are saving our powder.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then finish the business with a blow from a knife.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Spy,&rdquo; said the handsome Enjolras, &ldquo;we are judges and not assassins.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he called Gavroche:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Here you! go about your business! Do what I told you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going!&rdquo; cried Gavroche.</p><p>And halting as he was on the point of setting out:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;By the way, you will give me his gun!&rdquo; and he added: &ldquo;I leave you themusician, but I want the clarinet.&rdquo;</p><p>The gamin made the military salute and passed gayly through the opening inthe large barricade.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0284" id="link2HCH0284"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;MANY INTERROGATION POINTS WITH REGARD TO A CERTAIN LECABUC WHOSE NAME MAY NOT HAVE BEEN LE CABUC</h3><p>The tragic picture which we have undertaken would not be complete, thereader would not see those grand moments of social birth-pangs in arevolutionary birth, which contain convulsion mingled with effort, intheir exact and real relief, were we to omit, in the sketch here outlined,an incident full of epic and savage horror which occurred almostimmediately after Gavroche&rsquo;s departure.</p><p>Mobs, as the reader knows, are like a snowball, and collect as they rollalong, a throng of tumultuous men. These men do not ask each other whencethey come. Among the passers-by who had joined the rabble led by Enjolras,Combeferre, and Courfeyrac, there had been a person wearing the jacket ofa street porter, which was very threadbare on the shoulders, whogesticulated and vociferated, and who had the look of a drunken savage.This man, whose name or nickname was Le Cabuc, and who was, moreover, anutter stranger to those who pretended to know him, was very drunk, orassumed the appearance of being so, and had seated himself with severalothers at a table which they had dragged outside of the wine-shop. ThisCabuc, while making those who vied with him drunk seemed to be examiningwith a thoughtful air the large house at the extremity of the barricade,whose five stories commanded the whole street and faced the RueSaint-Denis. All at once he exclaimed:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know, comrades, it is from that house yonder that we must fire.When we are at the windows, the deuce is in it if any one can advance intothe street!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but the house is closed,&rdquo; said one of the drinkers.</p><p>&ldquo;Let us knock!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They will not open.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us break in the door!&rdquo;</p><p>Le Cabuc runs to the door, which had a very massive knocker, and knocks.The door opens not. He strikes a second blow. No one answers. A thirdstroke. The same silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Is there any one here?&rdquo; shouts Cabuc.</p><p>Nothing stirs.</p><p>Then he seizes a gun and begins to batter the door with the butt end.</p><p>It was an ancient alley door, low, vaulted, narrow, solid, entirely ofoak, lined on the inside with a sheet of iron and iron stays, a genuineprison postern. The blows from the butt end of the gun made the housetremble, but did not shake the door.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed, for atiny, square window was finally seen to open on the third story, and atthis aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of a gray-hairedold man, who was the porter, and who held a candle.</p><p>The man who was knocking paused.</p><p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the porter, &ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Open!&rdquo; said Cabuc.</p><p>&ldquo;That cannot be, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Open, nevertheless.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Impossible, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p><p>Le Cabuc took his gun and aimed at the porter; but as he was below, and asit was very dark, the porter did not see him.</p><p>&ldquo;Will you open, yes or no?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you say no?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I say no, my goo&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>The porter did not finish. The shot was fired; the ball entered under hischin and came out at the nape of his neck, after traversing the jugularvein.</p><p>The old man fell back without a sigh. The candle fell and wasextinguished, and nothing more was to be seen except a motionless headlying on the sill of the small window, and a little whitish smoke whichfloated off towards the roof.</p><p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Le Cabuc, dropping the butt end of his gun to the pavement.</p><p>He had hardly uttered this word, when he felt a hand laid on his shoulderwith the weight of an eagle&rsquo;s talon, and he heard a voice saying to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;On your knees.&rdquo;</p><p>The murderer turned round and saw before him Enjolras&rsquo; cold, white face.</p><p>Enjolras held a pistol in his hand.</p><p>He had hastened up at the sound of the discharge.</p><p>He had seized Cabuc&rsquo;s collar, blouse, shirt, and suspender with his lefthand.</p><p>&ldquo;On your knees!&rdquo; he repeated.</p><p>And, with an imperious motion, the frail young man of twenty years bentthe thickset and sturdy porter like a reed, and brought him to his kneesin the mire.</p><p>Le Cabuc attempted to resist, but he seemed to have been seized by asuperhuman hand.</p><p>Enjolras, pale, with bare neck and dishevelled hair, and his woman&rsquo;s face,had about him at that moment something of the antique Themis. His dilatednostrils, his downcast eyes, gave to his implacable Greek profile thatexpression of wrath and that expression of Chastity which, as the ancientworld viewed the matter, befit Justice.</p><p>The whole barricade hastened up, then all ranged themselves in a circle ata distance, feeling that it was impossible to utter a word in the presenceof the thing which they were about to behold.</p><p>Le Cabuc, vanquished, no longer tried to struggle, and trembled in everylimb.</p><p>Enjolras released him and drew out his watch.</p><p>&ldquo;Collect yourself,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Think or pray. You have one minute.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; murmured the murderer; then he dropped his head and stammered afew inarticulate oaths.</p><p>Enjolras never took his eyes off of him: he allowed a minute to pass, thenhe replaced his watch in his fob. That done, he grasped Le Cabuc by thehair, as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and shrieked,and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear. Many of those intrepidmen, who had so tranquilly entered upon the most terrible of adventures,turned aside their heads.</p><p>An explosion was heard, the assassin fell to the pavement face downwards.</p><p>Enjolras straightened himself up, and cast a convinced and severe glancearound him. Then he spurned the corpse with his foot and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Throw that outside.&rdquo;</p><p>Three men raised the body of the unhappy wretch, which was still agitatedby the last mechanical convulsions of the life that had fled, and flung itover the little barricade into the Rue Mondétour.</p><p>Enjolras was thoughtful. It is impossible to say what grandiose shadowsslowly spread over his redoubtable serenity. All at once he raised hisvoice.</p><p>A silence fell upon them.</p><p>&ldquo;Citizens,&rdquo; said Enjolras, &ldquo;what that man did is frightful, what I havedone is horrible. He killed, therefore I killed him. I had to do it,because insurrection must have its discipline. Assassination is even moreof a crime here than elsewhere; we are under the eyes of the Revolution,we are the priests of the Republic, we are the victims of duty, and mustnot be possible to slander our combat. I have, therefore, tried that man,and condemned him to death. As for myself, constrained as I am to do whatI have done, and yet abhorring it, I have judged myself also, and youshall soon see to what I have condemned myself.&rdquo;</p><p>Those who listened to him shuddered.</p><p>&ldquo;We will share thy fate,&rdquo; cried Combeferre.</p><p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; replied Enjolras. &ldquo;One word more. In executing this man, Ihave obeyed necessity; but necessity is a monster of the old world,necessity&rsquo;s name is Fatality. Now, the law of progress is, that monstersshall disappear before the angels, and that Fatality shall vanish beforeFraternity. It is a bad moment to pronounce the word love. No matter, I dopronounce it. And I glorify it. Love, the future is thine. Death, I makeuse of thee, but I hate thee. Citizens, in the future there will beneither darkness nor thunderbolts; neither ferocious ignorance, nor bloodyretaliation. As there will be no more Satan, there will be no moreMichael. In the future no one will kill any one else, the earth will beamwith radiance, the human race will love. The day will come, citizens, whenall will be concord, harmony, light, joy and life; it will come, and it isin order that it may come that we are about to die.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras ceased. His virgin lips closed; and he remained for some timestanding on the spot where he had shed blood, in marble immobility. Hisstaring eye caused those about him to speak in low tones.</p><p>Jean Prouvaire and Combeferre pressed each other&rsquo;s hands silently, and,leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade, they watched withan admiration in which there was some compassion, that grave young man,executioner and priest, composed of light, like crystal, and also of rock.</p><p>Let us say at once that later on, after the action, when the bodies weretaken to the morgue and searched, a police agent&rsquo;s card was found on LeCabuc. The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the specialreport on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832.</p><p>We will add, that if we are to believe a tradition of the police, which isstrange but probably well founded, Le Cabuc was Claquesous. The fact is,that dating from the death of Le Cabuc, there was no longer any questionof Claquesous. Claquesous had nowhere left any trace of his disappearance;he would seem to have amalgamated himself with the invisible. His life hadbeen all shadows, his end was night.</p><p>The whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the emotion ofthat tragic case which had been so quickly tried and so quicklyterminated, when Courfeyrac again beheld on the barricade, the small youngman who had inquired of him that morning for Marius.</p><p>This lad, who had a bold and reckless air, had come by night to join theinsurgents.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0329" id="link2H_4_0329"></a>BOOK THIRTEENTH&mdash;MARIUS ENTERS THE SHADOW</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0285" id="link2HCH0285"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;FROM THE RUE PLUMET TO THE QUARTIER SAINT-DENIS</h3><p>The voice which had summoned Marius through the twilight to the barricadeof the Rue de la Chanvrerie, had produced on him the effect of the voiceof destiny. He wished to die; the opportunity presented itself; he knockedat the door of the tomb, a hand in the darkness offered him the key. Thesemelancholy openings which take place in the gloom before despair, aretempting. Marius thrust aside the bar which had so often allowed him topass, emerged from the garden, and said: &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;</p><p>Mad with grief, no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid in hisbrain, incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after those twomonths passed in the intoxication of youth and love, overwhelmed at onceby all the reveries of despair, he had but one desire remaining, to make aspeedy end of all.</p><p>He set out at rapid pace. He found himself most opportunely armed, as hehad Javert&rsquo;s pistols with him.</p><p>The young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse, hadvanished from his sight in the street.</p><p>Marius, who had emerged from the Rue Plumet by the boulevard, traversedthe Esplanade and the bridge of the Invalides, the Champs-Élysées, thePlace Louis XV., and reached the Rue de Rivoli. The shops were open there,the gas was burning under the arcades, women were making their purchasesin the stalls, people were eating ices in the Café Laiter, and nibblingsmall cakes at the English pastry-cook&rsquo;s shop. Only a few posting-chaiseswere setting out at a gallop from the Hôtel des Princes and the HôtelMeurice.</p><p>Marius entered the Rue Saint-Honoré through the Passage Delorme. There theshops were closed, the merchants were chatting in front of their half-opendoors, people were walking about, the street lanterns were lighted,beginning with the first floor, all the windows were lighted as usual.There was cavalry on the Place du Palais-Royal.</p><p>Marius followed the Rue Saint-Honoré. In proportion as he left thePalais-Royal behind him, there were fewer lighted windows, the shops werefast shut, no one was chatting on the thresholds, the street grew sombre,and, at the same time, the crowd increased in density. For the passers-bynow amounted to a crowd. No one could be seen to speak in this throng, andyet there arose from it a dull, deep murmur.</p><p>Near the fountain of the Arbre-Sec, there were &ldquo;assemblages&rdquo;, motionlessand gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in themidst of running water.</p><p>At the entrance to the Rue des Prouvaires, the crowd no longer walked. Itformed a resisting, massive, solid, compact, almost impenetrable block ofpeople who were huddled together, and conversing in low tones. There werehardly any black coats or round hats now, but smock frocks, blouses, caps,and bristling and cadaverous heads. This multitude undulated confusedly inthe nocturnal gloom. Its whisperings had the hoarse accent of a vibration.Although not one of them was walking, a dull trampling was audible in themire. Beyond this dense portion of the throng, in the Rue du Roule, in theRue des Prouvaires, and in the extension of the Rue Saint-Honoré, therewas no longer a single window in which a candle was burning. Only thesolitary and diminishing rows of lanterns could be seen vanishing into thestreet in the distance. The lanterns of that date resembled large redstars, hanging to ropes, and shed upon the pavement a shadow which had theform of a huge spider. These streets were not deserted. There could bedescried piles of guns, moving bayonets, and troops bivouacking. Nocurious observer passed that limit. There circulation ceased. There therabble ended and the army began.</p><p>Marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more. He had beensummoned, he must go. He found a means to traverse the throng and to passthe bivouac of the troops, he shunned the patrols, he avoided thesentinels. He made a circuit, reached the Rue de Béthisy, and directed hiscourse towards the Halles. At the corner of the Rue des Bourdonnais, therewere no longer any lanterns.</p><p>After having passed the zone of the crowd, he had passed the limits of thetroops; he found himself in something startling. There was no longer apasser-by, no longer a soldier, no longer a light, there was no one;solitude, silence, night, I know not what chill which seized hold uponone. Entering a street was like entering a cellar.</p><p>He continued to advance.</p><p>He took a few steps. Some one passed close to him at a run. Was it a man?Or a woman? Were there many of them? he could not have told. It had passedand vanished.</p><p>Proceeding from circuit to circuit, he reached a lane which he judged tobe the Rue de la Poterie; near the middle of this street, he came incontact with an obstacle. He extended his hands. It was an overturnedwagon; his foot recognized pools of water, gullies, and paving-stonesscattered and piled up. A barricade had been begun there and abandoned. Heclimbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of thebarrier. He walked very near the street-posts, and guided himself alongthe walls of the houses. A little beyond the barricade, it seemed to himthat he could make out something white in front of him. He approached, ittook on a form. It was two white horses; the horses of the omnibusharnessed by Bossuet in the morning, who had been straying at random allday from street to street, and had finally halted there, with the wearypatience of brutes who no more understand the actions of men, than manunderstands the actions of Providence.</p><p>Marius left the horses behind him. As he was approaching a street whichseemed to him to be the Rue du Contrat-Social, a shot coming no one knowswhence, and traversing the darkness at random, whistled close by him, andthe bullet pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended above his head over ahairdresser&rsquo;s shop. This pierced shaving-dish was still to be seen in1848, in the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of the pillars of themarket.</p><p>This shot still betokened life. From that instant forth he encounterednothing more.</p><p>The whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps.</p><p>Nevertheless, Marius pressed forward.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0286" id="link2HCH0286"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;AN OWL&rsquo;S VIEW OF PARIS</h3><p>A being who could have hovered over Paris that night with the wing of thebat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle.</p><p>All that old quarter of the Halles, which is like a city within a city,through which run the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, where a thousandlanes cross, and of which the insurgents had made their redoubt and theirstronghold, would have appeared to him like a dark and enormous cavityhollowed out in the centre of Paris. There the glance fell into an abyss.Thanks to the broken lanterns, thanks to the closed windows, there allradiance, all life, all sound, all movement ceased. The invisible policeof the insurrection were on the watch everywhere, and maintained order,that is to say, night. The necessary tactics of insurrection are to drownsmall numbers in a vast obscurity, to multiply every combatant by thepossibilities which that obscurity contains. At dusk, every window where acandle was burning received a shot. The light was extinguished, sometimesthe inhabitant was killed. Hence nothing was stirring. There was nothingbut fright, mourning, stupor in the houses; and in the streets, a sort ofsacred horror. Not even the long rows of windows and stores, theindentations of the chimneys, and the roofs, and the vague reflectionswhich are cast back by the wet and muddy pavements, were visible. An eyecast upward at that mass of shadows might, perhaps, have caught a glimpsehere and there, at intervals, of indistinct gleams which brought outbroken and eccentric lines, and profiles of singular buildings, somethinglike the lights which go and come in ruins; it was at such points that thebarricades were situated. The rest was a lake of obscurity, foggy, heavy,and funereal, above which, in motionless and melancholy outlines, rose thetower of Saint-Jacques, the church of Saint-Merry, and two or three moreof those grand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makesphantoms.</p><p>All around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth, in the quarters wherethe Parisian circulation had not been annihilated, and where a few streetlanterns still burned, the aerial observer might have distinguished themetallic gleam of swords and bayonets, the dull rumble of artillery, andthe swarming of silent battalions whose ranks were swelling from minute tominute; a formidable girdle which was slowly drawing in and around theinsurrection.</p><p>The invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous cavern;everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless, and, as we have justseen, any street which one might come to offered nothing but darkness.</p><p>A wild darkness, full of traps, full of unseen and formidable shocks, intowhich it was alarming to penetrate, and in which it was terrible toremain, where those who entered shivered before those whom they awaited,where those who waited shuddered before those who were coming. Invisiblecombatants were entrenched at every corner of the street; snares of thesepulchre concealed in the density of night. All was over. No more lightwas to be hoped for, henceforth, except the lightning of guns, no furtherencounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death. Where? How?When? No one knew, but it was certain and inevitable. In this place whichhad been marked out for the struggle, the Government and the insurrection,the National Guard, and popular societies, the bourgeois and the uprising,groping their way, were about to come into contact. The necessity was thesame for both. The only possible issue thenceforth was to emerge thencekilled or conquerors. A situation so extreme, an obscurity so powerful,that the most timid felt themselves seized with resolution, and the mostdaring with terror.</p><p>Moreover, on both sides, the fury, the rage, and the determination wereequal. For the one party, to advance meant death, and no one dreamed ofretreating; for the other, to remain meant death, and no one dreamed offlight.</p><p>It was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day, thattriumph should rest either here or there, that the insurrection shouldprove itself a revolution or a skirmish. The Government understood this aswell as the parties; the most insignificant bourgeois felt it. Hence athought of anguish which mingled with the impenetrable gloom of thisquarter where all was at the point of being decided; hence a redoubledanxiety around that silence whence a catastrophe was on the point ofemerging. Here only one sound was audible, a sound as heart-rending as thedeath rattle, as menacing as a malediction, the tocsin of Saint-Merry.Nothing could be more blood-curdling than the clamor of that wild anddesperate bell, wailing amid the shadows.</p><p>As it often happens, nature seemed to have fallen into accord with whatmen were about to do. Nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole effect.The stars had disappeared, heavy clouds filled the horizon with theirmelancholy folds. A black sky rested on these dead streets, as though animmense winding-sheet were being outspread over this immense tomb.</p><p>While a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation in thesame locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary events,while youth, the secret associations, the schools, in the name ofprinciples, and the middle classes, in the name of interests, wereapproaching preparatory to dashing themselves together, clasping andthrowing each other, while each one hastened and invited the last anddecisive hour of the crisis, far away and quite outside of this fatalquarter, in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities of thatwretched old Paris which disappears under the splendor of happy andopulent Paris, the sombre voice of the people could be heard givingutterance to a dull roar.</p><p>A fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute andof the word of God, which terrifies the weak and which warns the wise,which comes both from below like the voice of the lion, and from on highlike the voice of the thunder.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0287" id="link2HCH0287"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE EXTREME EDGE</h3><p>Marius had reached the Halles.</p><p>There everything was still calmer, more obscure and more motionless thanin the neighboring streets. One would have said that the glacial peace ofthe sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over theheavens.</p><p>Nevertheless, a red glow brought out against this black background thelofty roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie on theSaint-Eustache side. It was the reflection of the torch which was burningin the Corinthe barricade. Marius directed his steps towards that redlight. It had drawn him to the Marché-aux-Poirées, and he caught a glimpseof the dark mouth of the Rue des Prêcheurs. He entered it. The insurgents&rsquo;sentinel, who was guarding the other end, did not see him. He felt that hewas very close to that which he had come in search of, and he walked ontiptoe. In this manner he reached the elbow of that short section of theRue Mondétour which was, as the reader will remember, the onlycommunication which Enjolras had preserved with the outside world. At thecorner of the last house, on his left, he thrust his head forward, andlooked into the fragment of the Rue Mondétour.</p><p>A little beyond the angle of the lane and the Rue de la Chanvrerie whichcast a broad curtain of shadow, in which he was himself engulfed, heperceived some light on the pavement, a bit of the wine-shop, and beyond,a flickering lamp within a sort of shapeless wall, and men crouching downwith guns on their knees. All this was ten fathoms distant from him. Itwas the interior of the barricade.</p><p>The houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest of thewine-shop, the large barricade, and the flag from him.</p><p>Marius had but a step more to take.</p><p>Then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post, folded his arms, andfell to thinking about his father.</p><p>He thought of that heroic Colonel Pontmercy, who had been so proud asoldier, who had guarded the frontier of France under the Republic, andhad touched the frontier of Asia under Napoleon, who had beheld Genoa,Alexandria, Milan, Turin, Madrid, Vienna, Dresden, Berlin, Moscow, who hadleft on all the victorious battle-fields of Europe drops of that sameblood, which he, Marius, had in his veins, who had grown gray before histime in discipline and command, who had lived with his sword-belt buckled,his epaulets falling on his breast, his cockade blackened with powder, hisbrow furrowed with his helmet, in barracks, in camp, in the bivouac, inambulances, and who, at the expiration of twenty years, had returned fromthe great wars with a scarred cheek, a smiling countenance, tranquil,admirable, pure as a child, having done everything for France and nothingagainst her.</p><p>He said to himself that his day had also come now, that his hour hadstruck, that following his father, he too was about to show himself brave,intrepid, bold, to run to meet the bullets, to offer his breast tobayonets, to shed his blood, to seek the enemy, to seek death, that he wasabout to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of battle, and thatthe field of battle upon which he was to descend was the street, and thatthe war in which he was about to engage was civil war!</p><p>He beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him, and into this he wasabout to fall. Then he shuddered.</p><p>He thought of his father&rsquo;s sword, which his grandfather had sold to asecond-hand dealer, and which he had so mournfully regretted. He said tohimself that that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape fromhim, and to depart in wrath into the gloom; that if it had thus fled, itwas because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the future;that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion, the war of the gutters,the war of the pavements, fusillades through cellar-windows, blows givenand received in the rear; it was because, coming from Marengo andFriedland, it did not wish to go to the Rue de la Chanvrerie; it wasbecause, after what it had done with the father, it did not wish to dothis for the son! He told himself that if that sword were there, if aftertaking possession of it at his father&rsquo;s pillow, he had dared to take itand carry it off for this combat of darkness between Frenchmen in thestreets, it would assuredly have scorched his hands and burst out aflamebefore his eyes, like the sword of the angel! He told himself that it wasfortunate that it was not there and that it had disappeared, that that waswell, that that was just, that his grandfather had been the true guardianof his father&rsquo;s glory, and that it was far better that the colonel&rsquo;s swordshould be sold at auction, sold to the old-clothes man, thrown among theold junk, than that it should, to-day, wound the side of his country.</p><p>And then he fell to weeping bitterly.</p><p>This was horrible. But what was he to do? Live without Cosette he couldnot. Since she was gone, he must needs die. Had he not given her his wordof honor that he would die? She had gone knowing that; this meant that itpleased her that Marius should die. And then, it was clear that she nolonger loved him, since she had departed thus without warning, without aword, without a letter, although she knew his address! What was the goodof living, and why should he live now? And then, what! should he retreatafter going so far? should he flee from danger after having approached it?should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade? slipaway, all in a tremble, saying: &ldquo;After all, I have had enough of it as itis. I have seen it, that suffices, this is civil war, and I shall take myleave!&rdquo; Should he abandon his friends who were expecting him? Who were inneed of him possibly! who were a mere handful against an army! Should hebe untrue at once to his love, to country, to his word? Should he give tohis cowardice the pretext of patriotism? But this was impossible, and ifthe phantom of his father was there in the gloom, and beheld himretreating, he would beat him on the loins with the flat of his sword, andshout to him: &ldquo;March on, you poltroon!&rdquo;</p><p>Thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts, he dropped hishead.</p><p>All at once he raised it. A sort of splendid rectification had just beeneffected in his mind. There is a widening of the sphere of thought whichis peculiar to the vicinity of the grave; it makes one see clearly to benear death. The vision of the action into which he felt that he was,perhaps, on the point of entering, appeared to him no more as lamentable,but as superb. The war of the street was suddenly transfigured by someunfathomable inward working of his soul, before the eye of his thought.All the tumultuous interrogation points of reverie recurred to him inthrongs, but without troubling him. He left none of them unanswered.</p><p>Let us see, why should his father be indignant? Are there not cases whereinsurrection rises to the dignity of duty? What was there that wasdegrading for the son of Colonel Pontmercy in the combat which was aboutto begin? It is no longer Montmirail nor Champaubert; it is somethingquite different. The question is no longer one of sacred territory,&mdash;butof a holy idea. The country wails, that may be, but humanity applauds. Butis it true that the country does wail? France bleeds, but liberty smiles;and in the presence of liberty&rsquo;s smile, France forgets her wound. And thenif we look at things from a still more lofty point of view, why do wespeak of civil war?</p><p>Civil war&mdash;what does that mean? Is there a foreign war? Is not allwar between men, war between brothers? War is qualified only by itsobject. There is no such thing as foreign or civil war; there is only justand unjust war. Until that day when the grand human agreement isconcluded, war, that at least which is the effort of the future, which ishastening on against the past, which is lagging in the rear, may benecessary. What have we to reproach that war with? War does not become adisgrace, the sword does not become a disgrace, except when it is used forassassinating the right, progress, reason, civilization, truth. Then war,whether foreign or civil, is iniquitous; it is called crime. Outside thepale of that holy thing, justice, by what right does one form of mandespise another? By what right should the sword of Washington disown thepike of Camille Desmoulins? Leonidas against the stranger, Timoleonagainst the tyrant, which is the greater? the one is the defender, theother the liberator. Shall we brand every appeal to arms within a city&rsquo;slimits without taking the object into a consideration? Then note theinfamy of Brutus, Marcel, Arnould von Blankenheim, Coligny, Hedgerow war?War of the streets? Why not? That was the war of Ambiorix, of Artevelde,of Marnix, of Pelagius. But Ambiorix fought against Rome, Arteveldeagainst France, Marnix against Spain, Pelagius against the Moors; allagainst the foreigner. Well, the monarchy is a foreigner; oppression is astranger; the right divine is a stranger. Despotism violates the moralfrontier, an invasion violates the geographical frontier. Driving out thetyrant or driving out the English, in both cases, regaining possession ofone&rsquo;s own territory. There comes an hour when protestation no longersuffices; after philosophy, action is required; live force finishes whatthe idea has sketched out; Prometheus chained begins, Arostogeiton ends;the encyclopedia enlightens souls, the 10th of August electrifies them.After Æschylus, Thrasybulus; after Diderot, Danton. Multitudes have atendency to accept the master. Their mass bears witness to apathy. A crowdis easily led as a whole to obedience. Men must be stirred up, pushed on,treated roughly by the very benefit of their deliverance, their eyes mustbe wounded by the true, light must be hurled at them in terrible handfuls.They must be a little thunderstruck themselves at their own well-being;this dazzling awakens them. Hence the necessity of tocsins and wars. Greatcombatants must rise, must enlighten nations with audacity, and shake upthat sad humanity which is covered with gloom by the right divine,Cæsarian glory, force, fanaticism, irresponsible power, and absolutemajesty; a rabble stupidly occupied in the contemplation, in theirtwilight splendor, of these sombre triumphs of the night. Down with thetyrant! Of whom are you speaking? Do you call Louis Philippe the tyrant?No; no more than Louis XVI. Both of them are what history is in the habitof calling good kings; but principles are not to be parcelled out, thelogic of the true is rectilinear, the peculiarity of truth is that itlacks complaisance; no concessions, then; all encroachments on man shouldbe repressed. There is a divine right in Louis XVI., there is <i>because aBourbon</i> in Louis Philippe; both represent in a certain measure theconfiscation of right, and, in order to clear away universal insurrection,they must be combated; it must be done, France being always the one tobegin. When the master falls in France, he falls everywhere. In short,what cause is more just, and consequently, what war is greater, than thatwhich re-establishes social truth, restores her throne to liberty,restores the people to the people, restores sovereignty to man, replacesthe purple on the head of France, restores equity and reason in theirplenitude, suppresses every germ of antagonism by restoring each one tohimself, annihilates the obstacle which royalty presents to the wholeimmense universal concord, and places the human race once more on a levelwith the right? These wars build up peace. An enormous fortress ofprejudices, privileges, superstitions, lies, exactions, abuses, violences,iniquities, and darkness still stands erect in this world, with its towersof hatred. It must be cast down. This monstrous mass must be made tocrumble. To conquer at Austerlitz is grand; to take the Bastille isimmense.</p><p>There is no one who has not noticed it in his own case&mdash;the soul,&mdash;andtherein lies the marvel of its unity complicated with ubiquity, has astrange aptitude for reasoning almost coldly in the most violentextremities, and it often happens that heartbroken passion and profounddespair in the very agony of their blackest monologues, treat subjects anddiscuss theses. Logic is mingled with convulsion, and the thread of thesyllogism floats, without breaking, in the mournful storm of thought. Thiswas the situation of Marius&rsquo; mind.</p><p>As he meditated thus, dejected but resolute, hesitating in everydirection, and, in short, shuddering at what he was about to do, hisglance strayed to the interior of the barricade. The insurgents were hereconversing in a low voice, without moving, and there was perceptible thatquasi-silence which marks the last stage of expectation. Overhead, at thesmall window in the third story Marius descried a sort of spectator whoappeared to him to be singularly attentive. This was the porter who hadbeen killed by Le Cabuc. Below, by the lights of the torch, which wasthrust between the paving-stones, this head could be vaguelydistinguished. Nothing could be stranger, in that sombre and uncertaingleam, than that livid, motionless, astonished face, with its bristlinghair, its eyes fixed and staring, and its yawning mouth, bent over thestreet in an attitude of curiosity. One would have said that the man whowas dead was surveying those who were about to die. A long trail of bloodwhich had flowed from that head, descended in reddish threads from thewindow to the height of the first floor, where it stopped.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0333" id="link2H_4_0333"></a>BOOK FOURTEENTH&mdash;THE GRANDEURS OF DESPAIR</h3><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0036" id="linkimage-0036"></a><img src="images/4b14-1-grandeur-of-despair.jpg" alt="The Grandeurs of Despair" width="100%" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0288" id="link2HCH0288"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE FLAG: ACT FIRST</h3><p>As yet, nothing had come. Ten o&rsquo;clock had sounded from Saint-Merry.Enjolras and Combeferre had gone and seated themselves, carbines in hand,near the outlet of the grand barricade. They no longer addressed eachother, they listened, seeking to catch even the faintest and most distantsound of marching.</p><p>Suddenly, in the midst of the dismal calm, a clear, gay, young voice,which seemed to come from the Rue Saint-Denis, rose and began to singdistinctly, to the old popular air of &ldquo;By the Light of the Moon,&rdquo; this bitof poetry, terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">Mon nez est en larmes,<br/>Mon ami Bugeaud,<br/>Prête moi tes gendarmes<br/>Pour leur dire un mot.<br/>En capote bleue,<br/>La poule au shako,<br/>Voici la banlieue!<br/>Co-cocorico!<a href="#linknote-54" name="linknoteref-54" id="linknoteref-54">54</a></p><p>They pressed each other&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>&ldquo;That is Gavroche,&rdquo; said Enjolras.</p><p>&ldquo;He is warning us,&rdquo; said Combeferre.</p><p>A hasty rush troubled the deserted street; they beheld a being more agilethan a clown climb over the omnibus, and Gavroche bounded into thebarricade, all breathless, saying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My gun! Here they are!&rdquo;</p><p>An electric quiver shot through the whole barricade, and the sound ofhands seeking their guns became audible.</p><p>&ldquo;Would you like my carbine?&rdquo; said Enjolras to the lad.</p><p>&ldquo;I want a big gun,&rdquo; replied Gavroche.</p><p>And he seized Javert&rsquo;s gun.</p><p>Two sentinels had fallen back, and had come in almost at the same momentas Gavroche. They were the sentinels from the end of the street, and thevidette of the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The vidette of the Lane desPrêcheurs had remained at his post, which indicated that nothing wasapproaching from the direction of the bridges and Halles.</p><p>The Rue de la Chanvrerie, of which a few paving-stones alone were dimlyvisible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag, offered tothe insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into asmoke.</p><p>Each man had taken up his position for the conflict.</p><p>Forty-three insurgents, among whom were Enjolras, Combeferre, Courfeyrac,Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and Gavroche, were kneeling inside the largebarricade, with their heads on a level with the crest of the barrier, thebarrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones as though atloop-holes, attentive, mute, ready to fire. Six, commanded by Feuilly, hadinstalled themselves, with their guns levelled at their shoulders, at thewindows of the two stories of Corinthe.</p><p>Several minutes passed thus, then a sound of footsteps, measured, heavy,and numerous, became distinctly audible in the direction of Saint-Leu.This sound, faint at first, then precise, then heavy and sonorous,approached slowly, without halt, without intermission, with a tranquil andterrible continuity. Nothing was to be heard but this. It was thatcombined silence and sound, of the statue of the commander, but this stonystep had something indescribably enormous and multiple about it whichawakened the idea of a throng, and, at the same time, the idea of aspectre. One thought one heard the terrible statue Legion marching onward.This tread drew near; it drew still nearer, and stopped. It seemed asthough the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of the street.Nothing was to be seen, however, but at the bottom of that dense obscuritythere could be distinguished a multitude of metallic threads, as fine asneedles and almost imperceptible, which moved about like thoseindescribable phosphoric networks which one sees beneath one&rsquo;s closedeyelids, in the first mists of slumber at the moment when one is droppingoff to sleep. These were bayonets and gun-barrels confusedly illuminatedby the distant reflection of the torch.</p><p>A pause ensued, as though both sides were waiting. All at once, from thedepths of this darkness, a voice, which was all the more sinister, sinceno one was visible, and which appeared to be the gloom itself speaking,shouted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;</p><p>At the same time, the click of guns, as they were lowered into position,was heard.</p><p>Enjolras replied in a haughty and vibrating tone:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The French Revolution!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; shouted the voice.</p><p>A flash empurpled all the façades in the street as though the door of afurnace had been flung open, and hastily closed again.</p><p>A fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade. The red flag fell. Thedischarge had been so violent and so dense that it had cut the staff, thatis to say, the very tip of the omnibus pole.</p><p>Bullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses penetrated thebarricade and wounded several men.</p><p>The impression produced by this first discharge was freezing. The attackhad been rough, and of a nature to inspire reflection in the boldest. Itwas evident that they had to deal with an entire regiment at the veryleast.</p><p>&ldquo;Comrades!&rdquo; shouted Courfeyrac, &ldquo;let us not waste our powder. Let us waituntil they are in the street before replying.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And, above all,&rdquo; said Enjolras, &ldquo;let us raise the flag again.&rdquo;</p><p>He picked up the flag, which had fallen precisely at his feet.</p><p>Outside, the clatter of the ramrods in the guns could be heard; the troopswere re-loading their arms.</p><p>Enjolras went on:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is there here with a bold heart? Who will plant the flag on thebarricade again?&rdquo;</p><p>Not a man responded. To mount on the barricade at the very moment when,without any doubt, it was again the object of their aim, was simply death.The bravest hesitated to pronounce his own condemnation. Enjolras himselffelt a thrill. He repeated:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Does no one volunteer?&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0289" id="link2HCH0289"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE FLAG: ACT SECOND</h3><p>Since they had arrived at Corinthe, and had begun the construction of thebarricade, no attention had been paid to Father Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf had notquitted the mob, however; he had entered the ground floor of the wine-shopand had seated himself behind the counter. There he had, so to speak,retreated into himself. He no longer seemed to look or to think.Courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times, warning him ofhis peril, beseeching him to withdraw, but he did not hear them. When theywere not speaking to him, his mouth moved as though he were replying tosome one, and as soon as he was addressed, his lips became motionless andhis eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive.</p><p>Several hours before the barricade was attacked, he had assumed anattitude which he did not afterwards abandon, with both fists planted onhis knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over aprecipice. Nothing had been able to move him from this attitude; it didnot seem as though his mind were in the barricade. When each had gone totake up his position for the combat, there remained in the tap-room whereJavert was bound to the post, only a single insurgent with a naked sword,watching over Javert, and himself, Mabeuf. At the moment of the attack, atthe detonation, the physical shock had reached him and had, as it were,awakened him; he started up abruptly, crossed the room, and at the instantwhen Enjolras repeated his appeal: &ldquo;Does no one volunteer?&rdquo; the old manwas seen to make his appearance on the threshold of the wine-shop. Hispresence produced a sort of commotion in the different groups. A shoutwent up:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It is the voter! It is the member of the Convention! It is therepresentative of the people!&rdquo;</p><p>It is probable that he did not hear them.</p><p>He strode straight up to Enjolras, the insurgents withdrawing before himwith a religious fear; he tore the flag from Enjolras, who recoiled inamazement and then, since no one dared to stop or to assist him, this oldman of eighty, with shaking head but firm foot, began slowly to ascend thestaircase of paving-stones arranged in the barricade. This was somelancholy and so grand that all around him cried: &ldquo;Off with your hats!&rdquo; At every step that he mounted, it was a frightful spectacle; his whitelocks, his decrepit face, his lofty, bald, and wrinkled brow, his amazedand open mouth, his aged arm upholding the red banner, rose through thegloom and were enlarged in the bloody light of the torch, and thebystanders thought that they beheld the spectre of &rsquo;93 emerging from theearth, with the flag of terror in his hand.</p><p>When he had reached the last step, when this trembling and terriblephantom, erect on that pile of rubbish in the presence of twelve hundredinvisible guns, drew himself up in the face of death and as though he weremore powerful than it, the whole barricade assumed amid the darkness, asupernatural and colossal form.</p><p>There ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence ofprodigies. In the midst of this silence, the old man waved the red flagand shouted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Long live the Revolution! Long live the Republic! Fraternity! Equality!and Death!&rdquo;</p><p>Those in the barricade heard a low and rapid whisper, like the murmur of apriest who is despatching a prayer in haste. It was probably thecommissary of police who was making the legal summons at the other end ofthe street.</p><p>Then the same piercing voice which had shouted: &ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo; shouted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Retire!&rdquo;</p><p>M. Mabeuf, pale, haggard, his eyes lighted up with the mournful flame ofaberration, raised the flag above his head and repeated:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Long live the Republic!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; said the voice.</p><p>A second discharge, similar to the first, rained down upon the barricade.</p><p>The old man fell on his knees, then rose again, dropped the flag and fellbackwards on the pavement, like a log, at full length, with outstretchedarms.</p><p>Rivulets of blood flowed beneath him. His aged head, pale and sad, seemedto be gazing at the sky.</p><p>One of those emotions which are superior to man, which make him forgeteven to defend himself, seized upon the insurgents, and they approachedthe body with respectful awe.</p><p>&ldquo;What men these regicides were!&rdquo; said Enjolras.</p><p>Courfeyrac bent down to Enjolras&rsquo; ear:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;This is for yourself alone, I do not wish to dampen the enthusiasm. Butthis man was anything rather than a regicide. I knew him. His name wasFather Mabeuf. I do not know what was the matter with him to-day. But hewas a brave blockhead. Just look at his head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The head of a blockhead and the heart of a Brutus,&rdquo; replied Enjolras.</p><p>Then he raised his voice:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Citizens! This is the example which the old give to the young. Wehesitated, he came! We were drawing back, he advanced! This is what thosewho are trembling with age teach to those who tremble with fear! This agedman is august in the eyes of his country. He has had a long life and amagnificent death! Now, let us place the body under cover, that each oneof us may defend this old man dead as he would his father living, and mayhis presence in our midst render the barricade impregnable!&rdquo;</p><p>A murmur of gloomy and energetic assent followed these words.</p><p>Enjolras bent down, raised the old man&rsquo;s head, and fierce as he was, hekissed him on the brow, then, throwing wide his arms, and handling thisdead man with tender precaution, as though he feared to hurt it, heremoved his coat, showed the bloody holes in it to all, and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;This is our flag now.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0290" id="link2HCH0290"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;GAVROCHE WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO ACCEPT ENJOLRAS&rsquo;CARBINE</h3><p>They threw a long black shawl of Widow Hucheloup&rsquo;s over Father Mabeuf. Sixmen made a litter of their guns; on this they laid the body, and bore it,with bared heads, with solemn slowness, to the large table in thetap-room.</p><p>These men, wholly absorbed in the grave and sacred task in which they wereengaged, thought no more of the perilous situation in which they stood.</p><p>When the corpse passed near Javert, who was still impassive, Enjolras saidto the spy:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It will be your turn presently!&rdquo;</p><p>During all this time, Little Gavroche, who alone had not quitted his post,but had remained on guard, thought he espied some men stealthilyapproaching the barricade. All at once he shouted:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo;</p><p>Courfeyrac, Enjolras, Jean Prouvaire, Combeferre, Joly, Bahorel, Bossuet,and all the rest ran tumultuously from the wine-shop. It was almost toolate. They saw a glistening density of bayonets undulating above thebarricade. Municipal guards of lofty stature were making their way in,some striding over the omnibus, others through the cut, thrusting beforethem the urchin, who retreated, but did not flee.</p><p>The moment was critical. It was that first, redoubtable moment ofinundation, when the stream rises to the level of the levee and when thewater begins to filter through the fissures of dike. A second more and thebarricade would have been taken.</p><p>Bahorel dashed upon the first municipal guard who was entering, and killedhim on the spot with a blow from his gun; the second killed Bahorel with ablow from his bayonet. Another had already overthrown Courfeyrac, who wasshouting: &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; The largest of all, a sort of colossus, marched onGavroche with his bayonet fixed. The urchin took in his arms Javert&rsquo;simmense gun, levelled it resolutely at the giant, and fired. No dischargefollowed. Javert&rsquo;s gun was not loaded. The municipal guard burst into alaugh and raised his bayonet at the child.</p><p>Before the bayonet had touched Gavroche, the gun slipped from thesoldier&rsquo;s grasp, a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman in the centreof the forehead, and he fell over on his back. A second bullet struck theother guard, who had assaulted Courfeyrac in the breast, and laid him lowon the pavement.</p><p>This was the work of Marius, who had just entered the barricade.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0291" id="link2HCH0291"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE BARREL OF POWDER</h3><p>Marius, still concealed in the turn of the Rue Mondétour, had witnessed,shuddering and irresolute, the first phase of the combat. But he had notlong been able to resist that mysterious and sovereign vertigo which maybe designated as the call of the abyss. In the presence of the imminenceof the peril, in the presence of the death of M. Mabeuf, that melancholyenigma, in the presence of Bahorel killed, and Courfeyrac shouting:&ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; of that child threatened, of his friends to succor or toavenge, all hesitation had vanished, and he had flung himself into theconflict, his two pistols in hand. With his first shot he had savedGavroche, and with the second delivered Courfeyrac.</p><p>Amid the sound of the shots, amid the cries of the assaulted guards, theassailants had climbed the entrenchment, on whose summit Municipal Guards,soldiers of the line and National Guards from the suburbs could now beseen, gun in hand, rearing themselves to more than half the height oftheir bodies.</p><p>They already covered more than two-thirds of the barrier, but they did notleap into the enclosure, as though wavering in the fear of some trap. Theygazed into the dark barricade as one would gaze into a lion&rsquo;s den. Thelight of the torch illuminated only their bayonets, their bear-skin caps,and the upper part of their uneasy and angry faces.</p><p>Marius had no longer any weapons; he had flung away his discharged pistolsafter firing them; but he had caught sight of the barrel of powder in thetap-room, near the door.</p><p>As he turned half round, gazing in that direction, a soldier took aim athim. At the moment when the soldier was sighting Marius, a hand was laidon the muzzle of the gun and obstructed it. This was done by some one whohad darted forward,&mdash;the young workman in velvet trousers. The shotsped, traversed the hand and possibly, also, the workman, since he fell,but the ball did not strike Marius. All this, which was rather to beapprehended than seen through the smoke, Marius, who was entering thetap-room, hardly noticed. Still, he had, in a confused way, perceived thatgun-barrel aimed at him, and the hand which had blocked it, and he hadheard the discharge. But in moments like this, the things which one seesvacillate and are precipitated, and one pauses for nothing. One feelsobscurely impelled towards more darkness still, and all is cloud.</p><p>The insurgents, surprised but not terrified, had rallied. Enjolras hadshouted: &ldquo;Wait! Don&rsquo;t fire at random!&rdquo; In the first confusion, they might,in fact, wound each other. The majority of them had ascended to the windowon the first story and to the attic windows, whence they commanded theassailants.</p><p>The most determined, with Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, andCombeferre, had proudly placed themselves with their backs against thehouses at the rear, unsheltered and facing the ranks of soldiers andguards who crowned the barricade.</p><p>All this was accomplished without haste, with that strange and threateninggravity which precedes engagements. They took aim, point blank, on bothsides: they were so close that they could talk together without raisingtheir voices.</p><p>When they had reached this point where the spark is on the brink ofdarting forth, an officer in a gorget extended his sword and said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Lay down your arms!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; replied Enjolras.</p><p>The two discharges took place at the same moment, and all disappeared insmoke.</p><p>An acrid and stifling smoke in which dying and wounded lay with weak, dullgroans. When the smoke cleared away, the combatants on both sides could beseen to be thinned out, but still in the same positions, reloading insilence. All at once, a thundering voice was heard, shouting:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Be off with you, or I&rsquo;ll blow up the barricade!&rdquo;</p><p>All turned in the direction whence the voice proceeded.</p><p>Marius had entered the tap-room, and had seized the barrel of powder, thenhe had taken advantage of the smoke, and the sort of obscure mist whichfilled the entrenched enclosure, to glide along the barricade as far asthat cage of paving-stones where the torch was fixed. To tear it from thetorch, to replace it by the barrel of powder, to thrust the pile of stonesunder the barrel, which was instantly staved in, with a sort of horribleobedience,&mdash;all this had cost Marius but the time necessary to stoopand rise again; and now all, National Guards, Municipal Guards, officers,soldiers, huddled at the other extremity of the barricade, gazed stupidlyat him, as he stood with his foot on the stones, his torch in his hand,his haughty face illuminated by a fatal resolution, drooping the flame ofthe torch towards that redoubtable pile where they could make out thebroken barrel of powder, and giving vent to that startling cry:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Be off with you, or I&rsquo;ll blow up the barricade!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius on that barricade after the octogenarian was the vision of theyoung revolution after the apparition of the old.</p><p>&ldquo;Blow up the barricade!&rdquo; said a sergeant, &ldquo;and yourself with it!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius retorted: &ldquo;And myself also.&rdquo;</p><p>And he dropped the torch towards the barrel of powder.</p><p>But there was no longer any one on the barrier. The assailants, abandoningtheir dead and wounded, flowed back pell-mell and in disorder towards theextremity of the street, and there were again lost in the night. It was aheadlong flight.</p><p>The barricade was free.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0292" id="link2HCH0292"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;END OF THE VERSES OF JEAN PROUVAIRE</h3><p>All flocked around Marius.

This whirlwind which was within him, produced on him the effectof being outside of him and of bearing him away. It seemed to him that hewas already at an immense distance from life. His two luminous months ofjoy and love, ending abruptly at that frightful precipice, Cosette lost tohim, that barricade, M. Mabeuf getting himself killed for the Republic,himself the leader of the insurgents,&mdash;all these things appeared tohim like a tremendous nightmare. He was obliged to make a mental effort torecall the fact that all that surrounded him was real. Marius had alreadyseen too much of life not to know that nothing is more imminent than theimpossible, and that what it is always necessary to foresee is theunforeseen. He had looked on at his own drama as a piece which one doesnot understand.</p><p>In the mists which enveloped his thoughts, he did not recognize Javert,who, bound to his post, had not so much as moved his head during the wholeof the attack on the barricade, and who had gazed on the revolt seethingaround him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of a judge.Marius had not even seen him.</p><p>In the meanwhile, the assailants did not stir, they could be heardmarching and swarming through at the end of the street but they did notventure into it, either because they were awaiting orders or because theywere awaiting reinforcements before hurling themselves afresh on thisimpregnable redoubt. The insurgents had posted sentinels, and some ofthem, who were medical students, set about caring for the wounded.</p><p>They had thrown the tables out of the wine-shop, with the exception of thetwo tables reserved for lint and cartridges, and of the one on which layFather Mabeuf; they had added them to the barricade, and had replaced themin the tap-room with mattresses from the bed of the widow Hucheloup andher servants. On these mattresses they had laid the wounded. As for thethree poor creatures who inhabited Corinthe, no one knew what had becomeof them. They were finally found, however, hidden in the cellar.</p><p>A poignant emotion clouded the joy of the disencumbered barricade.</p><p>The roll was called. One of the insurgents was missing. And who was it?One of the dearest. One of the most valiant. Jean Prouvaire. He was soughtamong the wounded, he was not there. He was sought among the dead, he wasnot there. He was evidently a prisoner. Combeferre said to Enjolras:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;They have our friend; we have their agent. Are you set on the death ofthat spy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Enjolras; &ldquo;but less so than on the life of Jean Prouvaire.&rdquo;</p><p>This took place in the tap-room near Javert&rsquo;s post.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Combeferre, &ldquo;I am going to fasten my handkerchief to mycane, and go as a flag of truce, to offer to exchange our man for theirs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Enjolras, laying his hand on Combeferre&rsquo;s arm.</p><p>At the end of the street there was a significant clash of arms.</p><p>They heard a manly voice shout:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Vive la France! Long live France! Long live the future!&rdquo;</p><p>They recognized the voice of Prouvaire.</p><p>A flash passed, a report rang out.</p><p>Silence fell again.</p><p>&ldquo;They have killed him,&rdquo; exclaimed Combeferre.</p><p>Enjolras glanced at Javert, and said to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Your friends have just shot you.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0293" id="link2HCH0293"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE AGONY OF DEATH AFTER THE AGONY OF LIFE</h3><p>A peculiarity of this species of war is, that the attack of the barricadesis almost always made from the front, and that the assailants generallyabstain from turning the position, either because they fear ambushes, orbecause they are afraid of getting entangled in the tortuous streets. Theinsurgents&rsquo; whole attention had been directed, therefore, to the grandbarricade, which was, evidently, the spot always menaced, and there thestruggle would infallibly recommence. But Marius thought of the littlebarricade, and went thither. It was deserted and guarded only by thefire-pot which trembled between the paving-stones. Moreover, the Mondétouralley, and the branches of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie and the Rue duCygne were profoundly calm.</p><p>As Marius was withdrawing, after concluding his inspection, he heard hisname pronounced feebly in the darkness.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Marius!&rdquo;</p><p>He started, for he recognized the voice which had called to him two hoursbefore through the gate in the Rue Plumet.</p><p>Only, the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath.</p><p>He looked about him, but saw no one.</p><p>Marius thought he had been mistaken, that it was an illusion added by hismind to the extraordinary realities which were clashing around him. Headvanced a step, in order to quit the distant recess where the barricadelay.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Marius!&rdquo; repeated the voice.</p><p>This time he could not doubt that he had heard it distinctly; he lookedand saw nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;At your feet,&rdquo; said the voice.</p><p>He bent down, and saw in the darkness a form which was dragging itselftowards him.</p><p>It was crawling along the pavement. It was this that had spoken to him.</p><p>The fire-pot allowed him to distinguish a blouse, torn trousers of coarsevelvet, bare feet, and something which resembled a pool of blood. Mariusindistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted towards him and whichwas saying to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You do not recognize me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Éponine.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius bent hastily down. It was, in fact, that unhappy child. She wasdressed in men&rsquo;s clothes.</p><p>&ldquo;How come you here? What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am dying,&rdquo; said she.</p><p>There are words and incidents which arouse dejected beings. Marius criedout with a start:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You are wounded! Wait, I will carry you into the room! They will attendto you there. Is it serious? How must I take hold of you in order not tohurt you? Where do you suffer? Help! My God! But why did you come hither?&rdquo;</p><p>And he tried to pass his arm under her, in order to raise her.</p><p>She uttered a feeble cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Have I hurt you?&rdquo; asked Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I only touched your hand.&rdquo;</p><p>She raised her hand to Marius, and in the middle of that hand Marius saw ablack hole.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter with your hand?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;It is pierced.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Pierced?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What with?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A bullet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Did you see a gun aimed at you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and a hand stopping it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was mine.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius was seized with a shudder.</p><p>&ldquo;What madness! Poor child! But so much the better, if that is all, it isnothing, let me carry you to a bed. They will dress your wound; one doesnot die of a pierced hand.&rdquo;</p><p>She murmured:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;The bullet traversed my hand, but it came out through my back. It isuseless to remove me from this spot. I will tell you how you can care forme better than any surgeon. Sit down near me on this stone.&rdquo;</p><p>He obeyed; she laid her head on Marius&rsquo; knees, and, without looking athim, she said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! How good this is! How comfortable this is! There; I no longersuffer.&rdquo;</p><p>She remained silent for a moment, then she turned her face with an effort,and looked at Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know what, Monsieur Marius? It puzzled me because you entered thatgarden; it was stupid, because it was I who showed you that house; andthen, I ought to have said to myself that a young man like you&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>She paused, and overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedlyexisted in her mind, she resumed with a heartrending smile:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You thought me ugly, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p><p>She continued:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You see, you are lost! Now, no one can get out of the barricade. It was Iwho led you here, by the way! You are going to die, I count upon that. Andyet, when I saw them taking aim at you, I put my hand on the muzzle of thegun. How queer it is! But it was because I wanted to die before you. WhenI received that bullet, I dragged myself here, no one saw me, no onepicked me up, I was waiting for you, I said: &lsquo;So he is not coming!&rsquo; Oh, ifyou only knew. I bit my blouse, I suffered so! Now I am well. Do youremember the day I entered your chamber and when I looked at myself inyour mirror, and the day when I came to you on the boulevard near thewasherwomen? How the birds sang! That was a long time ago. You gave me ahundred sous, and I said to you: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want your money.&rsquo; I hope youpicked up your coin? You are not rich. I did not think to tell you to pickit up. The sun was shining bright, and it was not cold. Do you remember,Monsieur Marius? Oh! How happy I am! Every one is going to die.&rdquo;</p><p>She had a mad, grave, and heart-breaking air. Her torn blouse disclosedher bare throat.</p><p>As she talked, she pressed her pierced hand to her breast, where there wasanother hole, and whence there spurted from moment to moment a stream ofblood, like a jet of wine from an open bung-hole.</p><p>Marius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she resumed, &ldquo;it is coming again, I am stifling!&rdquo;</p><p>She caught up her blouse and bit it, and her limbs stiffened on thepavement.</p><p>At that moment the young cock&rsquo;s crow executed by little Gavroche resoundedthrough the barricade.</p><p>The child had mounted a table to load his gun, and was singing gayly thesong then so popular:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;En voyant Lafayette,<br/>Le gendarme répète:&mdash;<br/>Sauvons nous! sauvons nous!<br/>    sauvons nous!&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;On beholding Lafayette,<br/>The gendarme repeats:&mdash;<br/>Let us flee! let us flee!<br/>    let us flee!</p><p>Éponine raised herself and listened; then she murmured:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It is he.&rdquo;</p><p>And turning to Marius:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My brother is here. He must not see me. He would scold me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your brother?&rdquo; inquired Marius, who was meditating in the most bitter andsorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the Thénardiers which hisfather had bequeathed to him; &ldquo;who is your brother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That little fellow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The one who is singing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius made a movement.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t go away,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it will not be long now.&rdquo;</p><p>She was sitting almost upright, but her voice was very low and broken byhiccoughs.</p><p>At intervals, the death rattle interrupted her. She put her face as nearthat of Marius as possible. She added with a strange expression:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, I do not wish to play you a trick. I have a letter in my pocketfor you. I was told to put it in the post. I kept it. I did not want tohave it reach you. But perhaps you will be angry with me for it when wemeet again presently? Take your letter.&rdquo;</p><p>She grasped Marius&rsquo; hand convulsively with her pierced hand, but she nolonger seemed to feel her sufferings. She put Marius&rsquo; hand in the pocketof her blouse. There, in fact, Marius felt a paper.</p><p>&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; said she.</p><p>Marius took the letter.</p><p>She made a sign of satisfaction and contentment.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, for my trouble, promise me&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>And she stopped.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Promise me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Promise to give me a kiss on my brow when I am dead.&mdash;I shall feelit.&rdquo;</p><p>She dropped her head again on Marius&rsquo; knees, and her eyelids closed. Hethought the poor soul had departed. Éponine remained motionless. All atonce, at the very moment when Marius fancied her asleep forever, sheslowly opened her eyes in which appeared the sombre profundity of death,and said to him in a tone whose sweetness seemed already to proceed fromanother world:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;And by the way, Monsieur Marius, I believe that I was a little bit inlove with you.&rdquo;</p><p>She tried to smile once more and expired.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0294" id="link2HCH0294"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;GAVROCHE AS A PROFOUND CALCULATOR OF DISTANCES</h3><p>Marius kept his promise. He dropped a kiss on that livid brow, where theicy perspiration stood in beads.</p><p>This was no infidelity to Cosette; it was a gentle and pensive farewell toan unhappy soul.</p><p>It was not without a tremor that he had taken the letter which Éponine hadgiven him. He had immediately felt that it was an event of weight. He wasimpatient to read it. The heart of man is so constituted that the unhappychild had hardly closed her eyes when Marius began to think of unfoldingthis paper.</p><p>He laid her gently on the ground, and went away. Something told him thathe could not peruse that letter in the presence of that body.</p><p>He drew near to a candle in the tap-room. It was a small note, folded andsealed with a woman&rsquo;s elegant care. The address was in a woman&rsquo;s hand andran:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;To Monsieur, Monsieur Marius Pontmercy, at M. Courfeyrac&rsquo;s, Rue de laVerrerie, No. 16.&rdquo;</p><p>He broke the seal and read:&mdash;</p><p class="letter">&ldquo;My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately.We shall be this evening in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé, No. 7.In a week we shall be in England. C<small>OSETTE</small>. June 4th.&rdquo;</p><p>Such was the innocence of their love that Marius was not even acquaintedwith Cosette&rsquo;s handwriting.</p><p>What had taken place may be related in a few words. Éponine had been thecause of everything. After the evening of the 3d of June she had cherisheda double idea, to defeat the projects of her father and the ruffians onthe house of the Rue Plumet, and to separate Marius and Cosette. She hadexchanged rags with the first young scamp she came across who had thoughtit amusing to dress like a woman, while Éponine disguised herself like aman. It was she who had conveyed to Jean Valjean in the Champ de Mars theexpressive warning: &ldquo;Leave your house.&rdquo; Jean Valjean had, in fact,returned home, and had said to Cosette: &ldquo;We set out this evening and we goto the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé with Toussaint. Next week, we shall be inLondon.&rdquo; Cosette, utterly overwhelmed by this unexpected blow, had hastilypenned a couple of lines to Marius. But how was she to get the letter tothe post? She never went out alone, and Toussaint, surprised at such acommission, would certainly show the letter to M. Fauchelevent. In thisdilemma, Cosette had caught sight through the fence of Éponine in man&rsquo;sclothes, who now prowled incessantly around the garden. Cosette had calledto &ldquo;this young workman&rdquo; and had handed him five francs and the letter,saying: &ldquo;Carry this letter immediately to its address.&rdquo; Éponine had putthe letter in her pocket. The next day, on the 5th of June, she went toCourfeyrac&rsquo;s quarters to inquire for Marius, not for the purpose ofdelivering the letter, but,&mdash;a thing which every jealous and lovingsoul will comprehend,&mdash;&ldquo;to see.&rdquo; There she had waited for Marius, orat least for Courfeyrac, still for the purpose of <i>seeing</i>. When Courfeyrachad told her: &ldquo;We are going to the barricades,&rdquo; an idea flashed throughher mind, to fling herself into that death, as she would have done intoany other, and to thrust Marius into it also. She had followed Courfeyrac,had made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process ofconstruction; and, quite certain, since Marius had received no warning,and since she had intercepted the letter, that he would go at dusk to histrysting place for every evening, she had betaken herself to the RuePlumet, had there awaited Marius, and had sent him, in the name of hisfriends, the appeal which would, she thought, lead him to the barricade.She reckoned on Marius&rsquo; despair when he should fail to find Cosette; shewas not mistaken. She had returned to the Rue de la Chanvrerie herself.What she did there the reader has just seen. She died with the tragic joyof jealous hearts who drag the beloved being into their own death, and whosay: &ldquo;No one shall have him!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius covered Cosette&rsquo;s letter with kisses. So she loved him! For onemoment the idea occurred to him that he ought not to die now. Then he saidto himself: &ldquo;She is going away. Her father is taking her to England, andmy grandfather refuses his consent to the marriage. Nothing is changed inour fates.&rdquo; Dreamers like Marius are subject to supreme attacks ofdejection, and desperate resolves are the result. The fatigue of living isinsupportable; death is sooner over with. Then he reflected that he hadstill two duties to fulfil: to inform Cosette of his death and send her afinal farewell, and to save from the impending catastrophe which was inpreparation, that poor child, Éponine&rsquo;s brother and Thénardier&rsquo;s son.</p><p>He had a pocket-book about him; the same one which had contained thenote-book in which he had inscribed so many thoughts of love for Cosette.He tore out a leaf and wrote on it a few lines in pencil:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Our marriage was impossible. I asked my grandfather, he refused; I haveno fortune, neither hast thou. I hastened to thee, thou wert no longerthere. Thou knowest the promise that I gave thee, I shall keep it. I die.I love thee. When thou readest this, my soul will be near thee, and thouwilt smile.&rdquo;</p><p>Having nothing wherewith to seal this letter, he contented himself withfolding the paper in four, and added the address:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;To Mademoiselle Cosette Fauchelevent, at M. Fauchelevent&rsquo;s, Rue del&rsquo;Homme Armé, No. 7.&rdquo;</p><p>Having folded the letter, he stood in thought for a moment, drew out hispocket-book again, opened it, and wrote, with the same pencil, these fourlines on the first page:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my body to my grandfather, M.Gillenormand, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais.&rdquo;</p><p>He put his pocketbook back in his pocket, then he called Gavroche.</p><p>The gamin, at the sound of Marius&rsquo; voice, ran up to him with his merry anddevoted air.</p><p>&ldquo;Will you do something for me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anything,&rdquo; said Gavroche. &ldquo;Good God! if it had not been for you, I shouldhave been done for.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you see this letter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Take it. Leave the barricade instantly&rdquo; (Gavroche began to scratch hisear uneasily) &ldquo;and to-morrow morning, you will deliver it at its addressto Mademoiselle Cosette, at M. Fauchelevent&rsquo;s, Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé, No.7.&rdquo;</p><p>The heroic child replied</p><p>&ldquo;Well, but! in the meanwhile the barricade will be taken, and I shall notbe there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The barricade will not be attacked until daybreak, according to allappearances, and will not be taken before to-morrow noon.&rdquo;</p><p>The fresh respite which the assailants were granting to the barricade had,in fact, been prolonged. It was one of those intermissions whichfrequently occur in nocturnal combats, which are always followed by anincrease of rage.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Gavroche, &ldquo;what if I were to go and carry your letterto-morrow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It will be too late. The barricade will probably be blockaded, all thestreets will be guarded, and you will not be able to get out. Go at once.&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche could think of no reply to this, and stood there in indecision,scratching his ear sadly.</p><p>All at once, he took the letter with one of those birdlike movements whichwere common with him.</p><p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>And he started off at a run through Mondétour lane.</p><p>An idea had occurred to Gavroche which had brought him to a decision, buthe had not mentioned it for fear that Marius might offer some objection toit.</p><p>This was the idea:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;It is barely midnight, the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé is not far off; I will goand deliver the letter at once, and I shall get back in time.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0341" id="link2H_4_0341"></a>BOOK FIFTEENTH&mdash;THE RUE DE L&rsquo;HOMME ARMÉ</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0295" id="link2HCH0295"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;A DRINKER IS A BABBLER</h3><p>What are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the insurrections ofthe soul? Man is a depth still greater than the people. Jean Valjean atthat very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval. Every sort of gulfhad opened again within him. He also was trembling, like Paris, on thebrink of an obscure and formidable revolution. A few hours had sufficed tobring this about. His destiny and his conscience had suddenly been coveredwith gloom. Of him also, as well as of Paris, it might have been said:&ldquo;Two principles are face to face. The white angel and the black angel areabout to seize each other on the bridge of the abyss. Which of the twowill hurl the other over? Who will carry the day?&rdquo;</p><p>On the evening preceding this same 5th of June, Jean Valjean, accompaniedby Cosette and Toussaint had installed himself in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé.A change awaited him there.</p><p>Cosette had not quitted the Rue Plumet without making an effort atresistance. For the first time since they had lived side by side,Cosette&rsquo;s will and the will of Jean Valjean had proved to be distinct, andhad been in opposition, at least, if they had not clashed. There had beenobjections on one side and inflexibility on the other. The abrupt advice:&ldquo;Leave your house,&rdquo; hurled at Jean Valjean by a stranger, had alarmed himto the extent of rendering him peremptory. He thought that he had beentraced and followed. Cosette had been obliged to give way.</p><p>Both had arrived in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé without opening their lips,and without uttering a word, each being absorbed in his own personalpreoccupation; Jean Valjean so uneasy that he did not notice Cosette&rsquo;ssadness, Cosette so sad that she did not notice Jean Valjean&rsquo;s uneasiness.</p><p>Jean Valjean had taken Toussaint with him, a thing which he had never donein his previous absences. He perceived the possibility of not returning tothe Rue Plumet, and he could neither leave Toussaint behind nor confidehis secret to her. Besides, he felt that she was devoted and trustworthy.Treachery between master and servant begins in curiosity. Now Toussaint,as though she had been destined to be Jean Valjean&rsquo;s servant, was notcurious. She stammered in her peasant dialect of Barneville: &ldquo;I am madeso; I do my work; the rest is no affair of mine.&rdquo;</p><p>In this departure from the Rue Plumet, which had been almost a flight,Jean Valjean had carried away nothing but the little embalmed valise,baptized by Cosette &ldquo;the inseparable.&rdquo; Full trunks would have requiredporters, and porters are witnesses. A fiacre had been summoned to the dooron the Rue de Babylone, and they had taken their departure.</p><p>It was with difficulty that Toussaint had obtained permission to pack up alittle linen and clothes and a few toilet articles. Cosette had taken onlyher portfolio and her blotting-book.</p><p>Jean Valjean, with a view to augmenting the solitude and the mystery ofthis departure, had arranged to quit the pavilion of the Rue Plumet onlyat dusk, which had allowed Cosette time to write her note to Marius. Theyhad arrived in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé after night had fully fallen.</p><p>They had gone to bed in silence.</p><p>The lodgings in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé were situated on a back court, onthe second floor, and were composed of two sleeping-rooms, a dining-roomand a kitchen adjoining the dining-room, with a garret where there was afolding-bed, and which fell to Toussaint&rsquo;s share. The dining-room was anantechamber as well, and separated the two bedrooms. The apartment wasprovided with all necessary utensils.</p><p>People re-acquire confidence as foolishly as they lose it; human nature isso constituted. Hardly had Jean Valjean reached the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Arméwhen his anxiety was lightened and by degrees dissipated. There aresoothing spots which act in some sort mechanically on the mind. An obscurestreet, peaceable inhabitants. Jean Valjean experienced an indescribablecontagion of tranquillity in that alley of ancient Paris, which is sonarrow that it is barred against carriages by a transverse beam placed ontwo posts, which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the clamorous city,dimly lighted at midday, and is, so to speak, incapable of emotionsbetween two rows of lofty houses centuries old, which hold their peacelike ancients as they are. There was a touch of stagnant oblivion in thatstreet. Jean Valjean drew his breath once more there. How could he befound there?</p><p>His first care was to place <i>the inseparable</i> beside him.</p><p>He slept well. Night brings wisdom; we may add, night soothes. On thefollowing morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay. He thought thedining-room charming, though it was hideous, furnished with an old roundtable, a long sideboard surmounted by a slanting mirror, a dilapidatedarmchair, and several plain chairs which were encumbered with Toussaint&rsquo;spackages. In one of these packages Jean Valjean&rsquo;s uniform of a NationalGuard was visible through a rent.</p><p>As for Cosette, she had had Toussaint take some broth to her room, and didnot make her appearance until evening.</p><p>About five o&rsquo;clock, Toussaint, who was going and coming and busyingherself with the tiny establishment, set on the table a cold chicken,which Cosette, out of deference to her father, consented to glance at.</p><p>That done, Cosette, under the pretext of an obstinate sick headache, hadbade Jean Valjean good night and had shut herself up in her chamber. JeanValjean had eaten a wing of the chicken with a good appetite, and with hiselbows on the table, having gradually recovered his serenity, had regainedpossession of his sense of security.</p><p>While he was discussing this modest dinner, he had, twice or thrice,noticed in a confused way, Toussaint&rsquo;s stammering words as she said tohim: &ldquo;Monsieur, there is something going on, they are fighting in Paris.&rdquo; But absorbed in a throng of inward calculations, he had paid no heed toit. To tell the truth, he had not heard her. He rose and began to pacefrom the door to the window and from the window to the door, growing evermore serene.</p><p>With this calm, Cosette, his sole anxiety, recurred to his thoughts. Notthat he was troubled by this headache, a little nervous crisis, a younggirl&rsquo;s fit of sulks, the cloud of a moment, there would be nothing left ofit in a day or two; but he meditated on the future, and, as was his habit,he thought of it with pleasure. After all, he saw no obstacle to theirhappy life resuming its course. At certain hours, everything seemsimpossible, at others everything appears easy; Jean Valjean was in themidst of one of these good hours. They generally succeed the bad ones, asday follows night, by virtue of that law of succession and of contrastwhich lies at the very foundation of nature, and which superficial mindscall antithesis. In this peaceful street where he had taken refuge, JeanValjean got rid of all that had been troubling him for some time past.This very fact, that he had seen many shadows, made him begin to perceivea little azure. To have quitted the Rue Plumet without complications orincidents was one good step already accomplished. Perhaps it would be wiseto go abroad, if only for a few months, and to set out for London. Well,they would go. What difference did it make to him whether he was in Franceor in England, provided he had Cosette beside him? Cosette was his nation.Cosette sufficed for his happiness; the idea that he, perhaps, did notsuffice for Cosette&rsquo;s happiness, that idea which had formerly been thecause of his fever and sleeplessness, did not even present itself to hismind. He was in a state of collapse from all his past sufferings, and hewas fully entered on optimism. Cosette was by his side, she seemed to behis; an optical illusion which every one has experienced. He arranged inhis own mind, with all sorts of felicitous devices, his departure forEngland with Cosette, and he beheld his felicity reconstituted wherever hepleased, in the perspective of his reverie.</p><p>As he paced to and fro with long strides, his glance suddenly encounteredsomething strange.</p><p>In the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard, he sawthe four lines which follow:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately. Weshall be this evening in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé, No. 7. In a week weshall be in England. COSETTE. June 4th.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean halted, perfectly haggard.</p><p>Cosette on her arrival had placed her blotting-book on the sideboard infront of the mirror, and, utterly absorbed in her agony of grief, hadforgotten it and left it there, without even observing that she had leftit wide open, and open at precisely the page on which she had laid to drythe four lines which she had penned, and which she had given in charge ofthe young workman in the Rue Plumet. The writing had been printed off onthe blotter.</p><p>The mirror reflected the writing.</p><p>The result was, what is called in geometry, <i>the symmetrical image</i>; so thatthe writing, reversed on the blotter, was righted in the mirror andpresented its natural appearance; and Jean Valjean had beneath his eyesthe letter written by Cosette to Marius on the preceding evening.</p><p>It was simple and withering.</p><p>Jean Valjean stepped up to the mirror. He read the four lines again, buthe did not believe them. They produced on him the effect of appearing in aflash of lightning. It was a hallucination, it was impossible. It was notso.</p><p>Little by little, his perceptions became more precise; he looked atCosette&rsquo;s blotting-book, and the consciousness of the reality returned tohim. He caught up the blotter and said: &ldquo;It comes from there.&rdquo; Hefeverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter, the reversalof the letters converted into an odd scrawl, and he saw no sense in it.Then he said to himself: &ldquo;But this signifies nothing; there is nothingwritten here.&rdquo; And he drew a long breath with inexpressible relief. Whohas not experienced those foolish joys in horrible instants? The soul doesnot surrender to despair until it has exhausted all illusions.</p><p>He held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid delight,almost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been the dupe.All at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again, and again he beheld thevision. There were the four lines outlined with inexorable clearness. Thistime it was no mirage. The recurrence of a vision is a reality; it waspalpable, it was the writing restored in the mirror. He understood.</p><p>Jean Valjean tottered, dropped the blotter, and fell into the oldarmchair beside the buffet, with drooping head, and glassy eyes, in utterbewilderment. He told himself that it was plain, that the light of theworld had been eclipsed forever, and that Cosette had written that to someone. Then he heard his soul, which had become terrible once more, givevent to a dull roar in the gloom. Try then the effect of taking from thelion the dog which he has in his cage!</p><p>Strange and sad to say, at that very moment, Marius had not yet receivedCosette&rsquo;s letter; chance had treacherously carried it to Jean Valjeanbefore delivering it to Marius. Up to that day, Jean Valjean had not beenvanquished by trial. He had been subjected to fearful proofs; no violenceof bad fortune had been spared him; the ferocity of fate, armed with allvindictiveness and all social scorn, had taken him for her prey and hadraged against him. He had accepted every extremity when it had beennecessary; he had sacrificed his inviolability as a reformed man, hadyielded up his liberty, risked his head, lost everything, sufferedeverything, and he had remained disinterested and stoical to such a pointthat he might have been thought to be absent from himself like a martyr.His conscience inured to every assault of destiny, might have appeared tobe forever impregnable. Well, any one who had beheld his spiritual selfwould have been obliged to concede that it weakened at that moment. It wasbecause, of all the tortures which he had undergone in the course of thislong inquisition to which destiny had doomed him, this was the mostterrible. Never had such pincers seized him hitherto. He felt themysterious stirring of all his latent sensibilities. He felt the pluckingat the strange chord. Alas! the supreme trial, let us say rather, the onlytrial, is the loss of the beloved being.</p><p>Poor old Jean Valjean certainly did not love Cosette otherwise than as afather; but we have already remarked, above, that into this paternity thewidowhood of his life had introduced all the shades of love; he lovedCosette as his daughter, and he loved her as his mother, and he loved heras his sister; and, as he had never had either a woman to love or a wife,as nature is a creditor who accepts no protest, that sentiment also, themost impossible to lose, was mingled with the rest, vague, ignorant, purewith the purity of blindness, unconscious, celestial, angelic, divine;less like a sentiment than like an instinct, less like an instinct thanlike an imperceptible and invisible but real attraction; and love,properly speaking, was, in his immense tenderness for Cosette, like thethread of gold in the mountain, concealed and virgin.</p><p>Let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have alreadyindicated. No marriage was possible between them; not even that of souls;and yet, it is certain that their destinies were wedded. With theexception of Cosette, that is to say, with the exception of a childhood,Jean Valjean had never, in the whole of his long life, known anything ofthat which may be loved. The passions and loves which succeed each otherhad not produced in him those successive green growths, tender green ordark green, which can be seen in foliage which passes through the winterand in men who pass fifty. In short, and we have insisted on it more thanonce, all this interior fusion, all this whole, of which the sum total wasa lofty virtue, ended in rendering Jean Valjean a father to Cosette. Astrange father, forged from the grandfather, the son, the brother, and thehusband, that existed in Jean Valjean; a father in whom there was includedeven a mother; a father who loved Cosette and adored her, and who heldthat child as his light, his home, his family, his country, his paradise.</p><p>Thus when he saw that the end had absolutely come, that she was escapingfrom him, that she was slipping from his hands, that she was gliding fromhim, like a cloud, like water, when he had before his eyes this crushingproof: &ldquo;another is the goal of her heart, another is the wish of her life;there is a dearest one, I am no longer anything but her father, I nolonger exist&rdquo;; when he could no longer doubt, when he said to himself:&ldquo;She is going away from me!&rdquo; the grief which he felt surpassed the boundsof possibility. To have done all that he had done for the purpose ofending like this! And the very idea of being nothing! Then, as we havejust said, a quiver of revolt ran through him from head to foot. He felt,even in the very roots of his hair, the immense reawakening of egotism,and the <i>I</i> in this man&rsquo;s abyss howled.</p><p>There is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil. Adespairing certainty does not make its way into a man without thrustingaside and breaking certain profound elements which, in some cases, are thevery man himself. Grief, when it attains this shape, is a headlong flightof all the forces of the conscience. These are fatal crises. Few among usemerge from them still like ourselves and firm in duty. When the limit ofendurance is overstepped, the most imperturbable virtue is disconcerted.Jean Valjean took the blotter again, and convinced himself afresh; heremained bowed and as though petrified and with staring eyes, over thosefour unobjectionable lines; and there arose within him such a cloud thatone might have thought that everything in this soul was crumbling away.</p><p>He examined this revelation, athwart the exaggerations of reverie, with anapparent and terrifying calmness, for it is a fearful thing when a man&rsquo;scalmness reaches the coldness of the statue.</p><p>He measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken without hishaving a suspicion of the fact; he recalled his fears of the precedingsummer, so foolishly dissipated; he recognized the precipice, it was stillthe same; only, Jean Valjean was no longer on the brink, he was at thebottom of it.</p><p>The unprecedented and heart-rending thing about it was that he had fallenwithout perceiving it. All the light of his life had departed, while hestill fancied that he beheld the sun.</p><p>His instinct did not hesitate. He put together certain circumstances,certain dates, certain blushes and certain pallors on Cosette&rsquo;s part, andhe said to himself: &ldquo;It is he.&rdquo;</p><p>The divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which never missesits aim. He struck Marius with his first conjecture. He did not know thename, but he found the man instantly. He distinctly perceived, in thebackground of the implacable conjuration of his memories, the unknownprowler of the Luxembourg, that wretched seeker of love adventures, thatidler of romance, that idiot, that coward, for it is cowardly to come andmake eyes at young girls who have beside them a father who loves them.</p><p>After he had thoroughly verified the fact that this young man was at thebottom of this situation, and that everything proceeded from that quarter,he, Jean Valjean, the regenerated man, the man who had so labored over hissoul, the man who had made so many efforts to resolve all life, allmisery, and all unhappiness into love, looked into his own breast andthere beheld a spectre, Hate.</p><p>Great griefs contain something of dejection. They discourage one withexistence. The man into whom they enter feels something within himwithdraw from him. In his youth, their visits are lugubrious; later onthey are sinister. Alas, if despair is a fearful thing when the blood ishot, when the hair is black, when the head is erect on the body like theflame on the torch, when the roll of destiny still retains its fullthickness, when the heart, full of desirable love, still possesses beatswhich can be returned to it, when one has time for redress, when all womenand all smiles and all the future and all the horizon are before one, whenthe force of life is complete, what is it in old age, when the yearshasten on, growing ever paler, to that twilight hour when one begins tobehold the stars of the tomb?</p><p>While he was meditating, Toussaint entered. Jean Valjean rose and askedher:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;In what quarter is it? Do you know?&rdquo;</p><p>Toussaint was struck dumb, and could only answer him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean began again: &ldquo;Did you not tell me that just now that there isfighting going on?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Toussaint. &ldquo;It is in the direction ofSaint-Merry.&rdquo;</p><p>There is a mechanical movement which comes to us, unconsciously, from themost profound depths of our thought. It was, no doubt, under the impulseof a movement of this sort, and of which he was hardly conscious, thatJean Valjean, five minutes later, found himself in the street.</p><p>Bareheaded, he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house. He seemedto be listening.</p><p>Night had come.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0296" id="link2HCH0296"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE STREET URCHIN AN ENEMY OF LIGHT</h3><p>How long did he remain thus? What was the ebb and flow of this tragicmeditation? Did he straighten up? Did he remain bowed? Had he been bent tobreaking? Could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscienceupon something solid? He probably would not have been able to tellhimself.</p><p>The street was deserted. A few uneasy bourgeois, who were rapidlyreturning home, hardly saw him. Each one for himself in times of peril.The lamp-lighter came as usual to light the lantern which was situatedprecisely opposite the door of No. 7, and then went away. Jean Valjeanwould not have appeared like a living man to any one who had examined himin that shadow. He sat there on the post of his door, motionless as a formof ice. There is congealment in despair. The alarm bells and a vague andstormy uproar were audible. In the midst of all these convulsions of thebell mingled with the revolt, the clock of Saint-Paul struck eleven,gravely and without haste; for the tocsin is man; the hour is God. Thepassage of the hour produced no effect on Jean Valjean; Jean Valjean didnot stir. Still, at about that moment, a brusque report burst forth in thedirection of the Halles, a second yet more violent followed; it wasprobably that attack on the barricade in the Rue de la Chanvrerie which wehave just seen repulsed by Marius. At this double discharge, whose furyseemed augmented by the stupor of the night, Jean Valjean started; herose, turning towards the quarter whence the noise proceeded; then he fellback upon the post again, folded his arms, and his head slowly sank on hisbosom again.</p><p>He resumed his gloomy dialogue with himself.</p><p>All at once, he raised his eyes; some one was walking in the street, heheard steps near him. He looked, and by the light of the lanterns, in thedirection of the street which ran into the Rue-aux-Archives, he perceiveda young, livid, and beaming face.</p><p>Gavroche had just arrived in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé.</p><p>Gavroche was staring into the air, apparently in search of something. Hesaw Jean Valjean perfectly well but he took no notice of him.</p><p>Gavroche after staring into the air, stared below; he raised himself ontiptoe, and felt of the doors and windows of the ground floor; they wereall shut, bolted, and padlocked. After having authenticated the fronts offive or six barricaded houses in this manner, the urchin shrugged hisshoulders, and took himself to task in these terms:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Pardi!&rdquo;</p><p>Then he began to stare into the air again.</p><p>Jean Valjean, who, an instant previously, in his then state of mind, wouldnot have spoken to or even answered any one, felt irresistibly impelled toaccost that child.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you, my little fellow?&rdquo; he said.</p><p>&ldquo;The matter with me is that I am hungry,&rdquo; replied Gavroche frankly. And headded: &ldquo;Little fellow yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean fumbled in his fob and pulled out a five-franc piece.</p><p>But Gavroche, who was of the wagtail species, and who skipped vivaciouslyfrom one gesture to another, had just picked up a stone. He had caughtsight of the lantern.</p><p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you still have your lanterns here. You aredisobeying the regulations, my friend. This is disorderly. Smash that forme.&rdquo;</p><p>And he flung the stone at the lantern, whose broken glass fell with such aclatter that the bourgeois in hiding behind their curtains in the oppositehouse cried: &ldquo;There is &lsquo;Ninety-three&rsquo; come again.&rdquo;</p><p>The lantern oscillated violently, and went out. The street had suddenlybecome black.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, old street,&rdquo; ejaculated Gavroche, &ldquo;put on your night-cap.&rdquo;</p><p>And turning to Jean Valjean:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the end ofthe street? It&rsquo;s the Archives, isn&rsquo;t it? I must crumble up those bigstupids of pillars a bit and make a nice barricade out of them.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean stepped up to Gavroche.</p><p>&ldquo;Poor creature,&rdquo; he said in a low tone, and speaking to himself, &ldquo;he ishungry.&rdquo;</p><p>And he laid the hundred-sou piece in his hand.</p><p>Gavroche raised his face, astonished at the size of this sou; he stared atit in the darkness, and the whiteness of the big sou dazzled him. He knewfive-franc pieces by hearsay; their reputation was agreeable to him; hewas delighted to see one close to. He said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Let us contemplate the tiger.&rdquo;</p><p>He gazed at it for several minutes in ecstasy; then, turning to JeanValjean, he held out the coin to him, and said majestically to him:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Bourgeois, I prefer to smash lanterns. Take back your ferocious beast.You can&rsquo;t bribe me. That has got five claws; but it doesn&rsquo;t scratch me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have you a mother?&rdquo; asked Jean Valjean.</p><p>Gavroche replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;More than you have, perhaps.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Jean Valjean, &ldquo;keep the money for your mother!&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche was touched. Moreover, he had just noticed that the man who wasaddressing him had no hat, and this inspired him with confidence.</p><p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so it wasn&rsquo;t to keep me from breaking the lanterns?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Break whatever you please.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine man,&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>And he put the five-franc piece into one of his pockets.</p><p>His confidence having increased, he added:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you belong in this street?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you tell me where No. 7 is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want with No. 7?&rdquo;</p><p>Here the child paused, he feared that he had said too much; he thrust hisnails energetically into his hair and contented himself with replying:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Here it is.&rdquo;</p><p>An idea flashed through Jean Valjean&rsquo;s mind. Anguish does have thesegleams. He said to the lad:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you the person who is bringing a letter that I am expecting?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; said Gavroche. &ldquo;You are not a woman.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The letter is for Mademoiselle Cosette, is it not?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette,&rdquo; muttered Gavroche. &ldquo;Yes, I believe that is the queer name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Jean Valjean, &ldquo;I am the person to whom you are to deliverthe letter. Give it here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In that case, you must know that I was sent from the barricade.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>Gavroche engulfed his hand in another of his pockets and drew out a paperfolded in four.</p><p>Then he made the military salute.</p><p>&ldquo;Respect for despatches,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It comes from the ProvisionalGovernment.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>Gavroche held the paper elevated above his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go and fancy it&rsquo;s a love letter. It is for a woman, but it&rsquo;s forthe people. We men fight and we respect the fair sex. We are not as theyare in fine society, where there are lions who send chickens<ahref="#linknote-55" name="linknoteref-55" id="linknoteref-55">55</a> tocamels.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give it to me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; continued Gavroche, &ldquo;you have the air of an honest man.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give it to me quick.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Catch hold of it.&rdquo;</p><p>And he handed the paper to Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;And make haste, Monsieur What&rsquo;s-your-name, for Mamselle Cosette iswaiting.&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche was satisfied with himself for having produced this remark.</p><p>Jean Valjean began again:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Is it to Saint-Merry that the answer is to be sent?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There you are making some of those bits of pastry vulgarly called<i>brioches</i> [blunders]. This letter comes from the barricade of the Rue de laChanvrerie, and I&rsquo;m going back there. Good evening, citizen.&rdquo;</p><p>That said, Gavroche took himself off, or, to describe it more exactly,fluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight like thatof an escaped bird. He plunged back into the gloom as though he made ahole in it, with the rigid rapidity of a projectile; the alley of l&rsquo;HommeArmé became silent and solitary once more; in a twinkling, that strangechild, who had about him something of the shadow and of the dream, hadburied himself in the mists of the rows of black houses, and was lostthere, like smoke in the dark; and one might have thought that he haddissipated and vanished, had there not taken place, a few minutes afterhis disappearance, a startling shiver of glass, and had not themagnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once moreabruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois. It was Gavroche upon his waythrough the Rue du Chaume.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0297" id="link2HCH0297"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;WHILE COSETTE AND TOUSSAINT ARE ASLEEP</h3><p>Jean Valjean went into the house with Marius&rsquo; letter.</p><p>He groped his way up the stairs, as pleased with the darkness as an owlwho grips his prey, opened and shut his door softly, listened to seewhether he could hear any noise,&mdash;made sure that, to all appearances,Cosette and Toussaint were asleep, and plunged three or four matches intothe bottle of the Fumade lighter before he could evoke a spark, so greatlydid his hand tremble. What he had just done smacked of theft. At last thecandle was lighted; he leaned his elbows on the table, unfolded the paper,and read.</p><p>In violent emotions, one does not read, one flings to the earth, so tospeak, the paper which one holds, one clutches it like a victim, onecrushes it, one digs into it the nails of one&rsquo;s wrath, or of one&rsquo;s joy;one hastens to the end, one leaps to the beginning; attention is at feverheat; it takes up in the gross, as it were, the essential points; itseizes on one point, and the rest disappears. In Marius&rsquo; note to Cosette,Jean Valjean saw only these words:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I die. When thou readest this, my soul will be near thee.&rdquo;</p><p>In the presence of these two lines, he was horribly dazzled; he remainedfor a moment, crushed, as it were, by the change of emotion which wastaking place within him, he stared at Marius&rsquo; note with a sort ofintoxicated amazement, he had before his eyes that splendor, the death ofa hated individual.</p><p>He uttered a frightful cry of inward joy. So it was all over. Thecatastrophe had arrived sooner than he had dared to hope. The being whoobstructed his destiny was disappearing. That man had taken himself off ofhis own accord, freely, willingly. This man was going to his death, andhe, Jean Valjean, had had no hand in the matter, and it was through nofault of his. Perhaps, even, he is already dead. Here his fever enteredinto calculations. No, he is not dead yet. The letter had evidently beenintended for Cosette to read on the following morning; after the twodischarges that were heard between eleven o&rsquo;clock and midnight, nothingmore has taken place; the barricade will not be attacked seriously untildaybreak; but that makes no difference, from the moment when &ldquo;that man&rdquo; isconcerned in this war, he is lost; he is caught in the gearing. JeanValjean felt himself delivered. So he was about to find himself alone withCosette once more. The rivalry would cease; the future was beginningagain. He had but to keep this note in his pocket. Cosette would neverknow what had become of that man. All that there requires to be done is tolet things take their own course. This man cannot escape. If he is notalready dead, it is certain that he is about to die. What good fortune!</p><p>Having said all this to himself, he became gloomy.</p><p>Then he went downstairs and woke up the porter.</p><p>About an hour later, Jean Valjean went out in the complete costume of aNational Guard, and with his arms.

We&rsquo;ll take the cart for the Republic, and leave the Auvergnat for theMonarchy.&rdquo;</p><p>His mind had just been illuminated by this flash of light:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;How bully that cart would look on our barricade!&rdquo;</p><p>The Auvergnat was snoring.</p><p>Gavroche gently tugged at the cart from behind, and at the Auvergnat fromthe front, that is to say, by the feet, and at the expiration of anotherminute the imperturbable Auvergnat was reposing flat on the pavement.</p><p>The cart was free.</p><p>Gavroche, habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters, hadeverything about him. He fumbled in one of his pockets, and pulled from ita scrap of paper and a bit of red pencil filched from some carpenter.</p><p>He wrote:&mdash;</p><p class="center"><i>&ldquo;French Republic.&rdquo;</i></p><p>&ldquo;Received thy cart.&rdquo;</p><p>And he signed it: &ldquo;G<small>AVROCHE</small>.&rdquo;</p><p>That done, he put the paper in the pocket of the still snoring Auvergnat&rsquo;svelvet vest, seized the cart shafts in both hands, and set off in thedirection of the Halles, pushing the cart before him at a hard gallop witha glorious and triumphant uproar.</p><p>This was perilous. There was a post at the Royal Printing Establishment.Gavroche did not think of this. This post was occupied by the NationalGuards of the suburbs. The squad began to wake up, and heads were raisedfrom camp beds. Two street lanterns broken in succession, that ditty sungat the top of the lungs. This was a great deal for those cowardly streets,which desire to go to sleep at sunset, and which put the extinguisher ontheir candles at such an early hour. For the last hour, that boy had beencreating an uproar in that peaceable arrondissement, the uproar of a flyin a bottle. The sergeant of the banlieue lent an ear. He waited. He was aprudent man.</p><p>The mad rattle of the cart, filled to overflowing the possible measure ofwaiting, and decided the sergeant to make a reconnaisance.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole band of them there!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us proceed gently.&rdquo;</p><p>It was clear that the hydra of anarchy had emerged from its box and thatit was stalking abroad through the quarter.</p><p>And the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread.</p><p>All at once, Gavroche, pushing his cart in front of him, and at the verymoment when he was about to turn into the Rue des Vieilles-Haudriettes,found himself face to face with a uniform, a shako, a plume, and a gun.</p><p>For the second time, he stopped short.</p><p>&ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s him. Good day, public order.&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche&rsquo;s amazement was always brief and speedily thawed.</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going, you rascal?&rdquo; shouted the sergeant.</p><p>&ldquo;Citizen,&rdquo; retorted Gavroche, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t called you &lsquo;bourgeois&rsquo; yet. Whydo you insult me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going, you rogue?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; retorted Gavroche, &ldquo;perhaps you were a man of wit yesterday,but you have degenerated this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I ask you where are you going, you villain?&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche replied:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;You speak prettily. Really, no one would suppose you as old as you are.You ought to sell all your hair at a hundred francs apiece. That wouldyield you five hundred francs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going, bandit?&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche retorted again:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;What villainous words! You must wipe your mouth better the first timethat they give you suck.&rdquo;</p><p>The sergeant lowered his bayonet.</p><p>&ldquo;Will you tell me where you are going, you wretch?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;General,&rdquo; said Gavroche &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way to look for a doctor for my wifewho is in labor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; shouted the sergeant.</p><p>The master-stroke of strong men consists in saving themselves by the verymeans that have ruined them; Gavroche took in the whole situation at aglance. It was the cart which had told against him, it was the cart&rsquo;splace to protect him.</p><p>At the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descent onGavroche, the cart, converted into a projectile and launched with all thelatter&rsquo;s might, rolled down upon him furiously, and the sergeant, struckfull in the stomach, tumbled over backwards into the gutter while his gunwent off in the air.</p><p>The men of the post had rushed out pell-mell at the sergeant&rsquo;s shout; theshot brought on a general random discharge, after which they reloadedtheir weapons and began again.</p><p>This blind-man&rsquo;s-buff musketry lasted for a quarter of an hour and killedseveral panes of glass.</p><p>In the meanwhile, Gavroche, who had retraced his steps at full speed,halted five or six streets distant and seated himself, panting, on thestone post which forms the corner of the Enfants-Rouges.</p><p>He listened.</p><p>After panting for a few minutes, he turned in the direction where thefusillade was raging, lifted his left hand to a level with his nose andthrust it forward three times, as he slapped the back of his head with hisright hand; an imperious gesture in which Parisian street-urchindom hascondensed French irony, and which is evidently efficacious, since it hasalready lasted half a century.</p><p>This gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m splitting with laughter, I&rsquo;m twisting with delight, Iabound in joy, but I&rsquo;m losing my way, I shall have to take a roundaboutway. If I only reach the barricade in season!&rdquo;</p><p>Thereupon he set out again on a run.</p><p>And as he ran:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, by the way, where was I?&rdquo; said he.</p><p>And he resumed his ditty, as he plunged rapidly through the streets, andthis is what died away in the gloom:&mdash;</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Mais il reste encore des bastilles,<br/>Et je vais mettre le holà<br/>Dans l&rsquo;ordre public que voilà.<br/>    Où vont les belles filles,<br/>        Lon la.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Quelqu&rsquo;un veut-il jouer aux quilles?<br/>Tout l&rsquo;ancien monde s&rsquo;écroula<br/>Quand la grosse boule roula.<br/>    Où vont les belles filles,<br/>        Lon la.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Vieux bon peuple, à coups de béquilles,<br/>Cassons ce Louvre où s&rsquo;étala<br/>La monarchie en falbala.<br/>    Où vont les belles filles,<br/>        Lon la.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Nous en avons forcé les grilles,<br/>Le roi Charles-Dix ce jour-là,<br/>Tenait mal et se décolla.<br/>    Où vont les belles filles,<br/>        Lon la.&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-57" name="linknoteref-57" id="linknoteref-57">57</a></p><p>The post&rsquo;s recourse to arms was not without result.

These two barricades, both of them symbols, under two differentaspects, of a redoubtable situation, sprang from the earth at the time ofthe fatal insurrection of June, 1848, the greatest war of the streets thathistory has ever beheld.</p><p>It sometimes happens that, even contrary to principles, even contrary toliberty, equality, and fraternity, even contrary to the universal vote,even contrary to the government, by all for all, from the depths of itsanguish, of its discouragements and its destitutions, of its fevers, ofits distresses, of its miasmas, of its ignorances, of its darkness, thatgreat and despairing body, the rabble, protests against, and that thepopulace wages battle against, the people.</p><p>Beggars attack the common right; the ochlocracy rises against demos.</p><p>These are melancholy days; for there is always a certain amount of nighteven in this madness, there is suicide in this duel, and those words whichare intended to be insults&mdash;beggars, canaille, ochlocracy, populace&mdash;exhibit,alas! rather the fault of those who reign than the fault of those whosuffer; rather the fault of the privileged than the fault of thedisinherited.</p><p>For our own part, we never pronounce those words without pain and withoutrespect, for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which they correspond,it often finds many a grandeur beside these miseries. Athens was anochlocracy; the beggars were the making of Holland; the populace savedRome more than once; and the rabble followed Jesus Christ.</p><p>There is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the magnificences ofthe lower classes.</p><p>It was of this rabble that Saint Jerome was thinking, no doubt, and of allthese poor people and all these vagabonds and all these miserable peoplewhence sprang the apostles and the martyrs, when he uttered thismysterious saying: <i>&ldquo;Fex urbis, lex orbis,&rdquo;</i>&mdash;the dregs of the city,the law of the earth.</p><p>The exasperations of this crowd which suffers and bleeds, its violencescontrary to all sense, directed against the principles which are its life,its masterful deeds against the right, are its popular <i>coups d&rsquo;état</i> andshould be repressed. The man of probity sacrifices himself, and out of hisvery love for this crowd, he combats it. But how excusable he feels iteven while holding out against it! How he venerates it even whileresisting it! This is one of those rare moments when, while doing thatwhich it is one&rsquo;s duty to do, one feels something which disconcerts one,and which would dissuade one from proceeding further; one persists, it isnecessary, but conscience, though satisfied, is sad, and theaccomplishment of duty is complicated with a pain at the heart.</p><p>June, 1848, let us hasten to say, was an exceptional fact, and almostimpossible of classification, in the philosophy of history. All the wordswhich we have just uttered, must be discarded, when it becomes a questionof this extraordinary revolt, in which one feels the holy anxiety of toilclaiming its rights. It was necessary to combat it, and this was a duty,for it attacked the republic. But what was June, 1848, at bottom? A revoltof the people against itself.</p><p>Where the subject is not lost sight of, there is no digression; may we,then, be permitted to arrest the reader&rsquo;s attention for a moment on thetwo absolutely unique barricades of which we have just spoken and whichcharacterized this insurrection.</p><p>One blocked the entrance to the Faubourg Saint Antoine; the other defendedthe approach to the Faubourg du Temple; those before whom these twofearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath the brilliantblue sky of June, will never forget them.</p><p>The Saint-Antoine barricade was tremendous; it was three stories high, andseven hundred feet wide. It barred the vast opening of the faubourg, thatis to say, three streets, from angle to angle; ravined, jagged, cut up,divided, crenelated, with an immense rent, buttressed with piles that werebastions in themselves throwing out capes here and there, powerfullybacked up by two great promontories of houses of the faubourg, it reareditself like a cyclopean dike at the end of the formidable place which hadseen the 14th of July. Nineteen barricades were ranged, one behind theother, in the depths of the streets behind this principal barricade. Atthe very sight of it, one felt the agonizing suffering in the immensefaubourg, which had reached that point of extremity when a distress maybecome a catastrophe. Of what was that barricade made? Of the ruins ofthree six-story houses demolished expressly, said some. Of the prodigy ofall wraths, said others. It wore the lamentable aspect of allconstructions of hatred, ruin. It might be asked: Who built this? It mightalso be said: Who destroyed this? It was the improvisation of theebullition. Hold! take this door! this grating! this penthouse! thischimney-piece! this broken brazier! this cracked pot! Give all! cast awayall! Push this roll, dig, dismantle, overturn, ruin everything! It was thecollaboration of the pavement, the block of stone, the beam, the bar ofiron, the rag, the scrap, the broken pane, the unseated chair, thecabbage-stalk, the tatter, the rag, and the malediction. It was grand andit was petty. It was the abyss parodied on the public place by hubbub. Themass beside the atom; the strip of ruined wall and the broken bowl,&mdash;threateningfraternization of every sort of rubbish. Sisyphus had thrown his rockthere and Job his potsherd. Terrible, in short. It was the acropolis ofthe barefooted. Overturned carts broke the uniformity of the slope; animmense dray was spread out there crossways, its axle pointing heavenward,and seemed a scar on that tumultuous façade; an omnibus hoisted gayly, bymain force, to the very summit of the heap, as though the architects ofthis bit of savagery had wished to add a touch of the street urchin humorto their terror, presented its horseless, unharnessed pole to no one knowswhat horses of the air. This gigantic heap, the alluvium of the revolt,figured to the mind an Ossa on Pelion of all revolutions; &rsquo;93 on &rsquo;89, the9th of Thermidor on the 10th of August, the 18th of Brumaire on the 11thof January, Vendemiaire on Prairial, 1848 on 1830. The situation deservedthe trouble and this barricade was worthy to figure on the very spotwhence the Bastille had disappeared. If the ocean made dikes, it is thusthat it would build. The fury of the flood was stamped upon this shapelessmass. What flood? The crowd. One thought one beheld hubbub petrified. Onethought one heard humming above this barricade as though there had beenover their hive, enormous, dark bees of violent progress. Was it athicket? Was it a bacchanalia? Was it a fortress? Vertigo seemed to haveconstructed it with blows of its wings. There was something of thecesspool in that redoubt and something Olympian in that confusion. Onethere beheld in a pell-mell full of despair, the rafters of roofs, bits ofgarret windows with their figured paper, window sashes with their glassplanted there in the ruins awaiting the cannon, wrecks of chimneys,cupboards, tables, benches, howling topsyturveydom, and those thousandpoverty-stricken things, the very refuse of the mendicant, which containat the same time fury and nothingness. One would have said that it was thetatters of a people, rags of wood, of iron, of bronze, of stone, and thatthe Faubourg Saint Antoine had thrust it there at its door, with acolossal flourish of the broom making of its misery its barricade. Blocksresembling headsman&rsquo;s blocks, dislocated chains, pieces of woodwork withbrackets having the form of gibbets, horizontal wheels projecting from therubbish, amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of theold tortures endured by the people. The barricade Saint Antoine convertedeverything into a weapon; everything that civil war could throw at thehead of society proceeded thence; it was not combat, it was a paroxysm;the carbines which defended this redoubt, among which there were someblunderbusses, sent bits of earthenware bones, coat-buttons, even thecasters from night-stands, dangerous projectiles on account of the brass.This barricade was furious; it hurled to the clouds an inexpressibleclamor; at certain moments, when provoking the army, it was covered withthrongs and tempest; a tumultuous crowd of flaming heads crowned it; aswarm filled it; it had a thorny crest of guns, of sabres, of cudgels, ofaxes, of pikes and of bayonets; a vast red flag flapped in the wind;shouts of command, songs of attack, the roll of drums, the sobs of womenand bursts of gloomy laughter from the starving were to be heard there. Itwas huge and living, and, like the back of an electric beast, thereproceeded from it little flashes of lightning. The spirit of revolutioncovered with its cloud this summit where rumbled that voice of the peoplewhich resembles the voice of God; a strange majesty was emitted by thistitanic basket of rubbish. It was a heap of filth and it was Sinai.</p><p>As we have said previously, it attacked in the name of the revolution&mdash;what?The revolution. It&mdash;that barricade, chance, hazard, disorder, terror,misunderstanding, the unknown&mdash;had facing it the ConstituentAssembly, the sovereignty of the people, universal suffrage, the nation,the republic; and it was the Carmagnole bidding defiance to theMarseillaise.</p><p>Immense but heroic defiance, for the old faubourg is a hero.</p><p>The faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance. The faubourgshouldered the redoubt, the redoubt took its stand under cover of thefaubourg. The vast barricade spread out like a cliff against which thestrategy of the African generals dashed itself. Its caverns, itsexcrescences, its warts, its gibbosities, grimaced, so to speak, andgrinned beneath the smoke. The mitraille vanished in shapelessness; thebombs plunged into it; bullets only succeeded in making holes in it; whatwas the use of cannonading chaos? and the regiments, accustomed to thefiercest visions of war, gazed with uneasy eyes on that species ofredoubt, a wild beast in its boar-like bristling and a mountain by itsenormous size.</p><p>A quarter of a league away, from the corner of the Rue du Temple whichdebouches on the boulevard near the Château-d&rsquo;Eau, if one thrust one&rsquo;s headbodily beyond the point formed by the front of the Dallemagne shop, oneperceived in the distance, beyond the canal, in the street which mountsthe slopes of Belleville at the culminating point of the rise, a strangewall reaching to the second story of the house fronts, a sort of hyphenbetween the houses on the right and the houses on the left, as though thestreet had folded back on itself its loftiest wall in order to closeitself abruptly. This wall was built of paving-stones. It was straight,correct, cold, perpendicular, levelled with the square, laid out by ruleand line. Cement was lacking, of course, but, as in the case of certainRoman walls, without interfering with its rigid architecture. Theentablature was mathematically parallel with the base. From distance todistance, one could distinguish on the gray surface, almost invisibleloopholes which resembled black threads. These loopholes were separatedfrom each other by equal spaces. The street was deserted as far as the eyecould reach. All windows and doors were closed. In the background rosethis barrier, which made a blind thoroughfare of the street, a motionlessand tranquil wall; no one was visible, nothing was audible; not a cry, nota sound, not a breath. A sepulchre.</p><p>The dazzling sun of June inundated this terrible thing with light.</p><p>It was the barricade of the Faubourg of the Temple.</p><p>As soon as one arrived on the spot, and caught sight of it, it wasimpossible, even for the boldest, not to become thoughtful before thismysterious apparition. It was adjusted, jointed, imbricated, rectilinear,symmetrical and funereal. Science and gloom met there. One felt that thechief of this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre. One looked at itand spoke low.</p><p>From time to time, if some soldier, an officer or representative of thepeople, chanced to traverse the deserted highway, a faint, sharp whistlewas heard, and the passer-by fell dead or wounded, or, if he escaped thebullet, sometimes a biscaïen was seen to ensconce itself in some closedshutter, in the interstice between two blocks of stone, or in the plasterof a wall. For the men in the barricade had made themselves two smallcannons out of two cast-iron lengths of gas-pipe, plugged up at one endwith tow and fire-clay. There was no waste of useless powder. Nearly everyshot told. There were corpses here and there, and pools of blood on thepavement. I remember a white butterfly which went and came in the street.Summer does not abdicate.</p><p>In the neighborhood, the spaces beneath the portes-cochères wereencumbered with wounded.</p><p>One felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did not see, and oneunderstood that guns were levelled at the whole length of the street.</p><p>Massed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal forms atthe entrance to the Faubourg du Temple, the soldiers of the attackingcolumn, gravely and thoughtfully, watched this dismal redoubt, thisimmobility, this passivity, whence sprang death. Some crawled flat ontheir faces as far as the crest of the curve of the bridge, taking carethat their shakos did not project beyond it.</p><p>The valiant Colonel Monteynard admired this barricade with a shudder.&mdash;&ldquo;Howthat is built!&rdquo; he said to a Representative. &ldquo;Not one paving-stoneprojects beyond its neighbor. It is made of porcelain.&rdquo;&mdash;At thatmoment, a bullet broke the cross on his breast, and he fell.</p><p>&ldquo;The cowards!&rdquo; people said. &ldquo;Let them show themselves. Let us see them!They dare not! They are hiding!&rdquo;</p><p>The barricade of the Faubourg du Temple, defended by eighty men, attackedby ten thousand, held out for three days. On the fourth, they did as atZaatcha, as at Constantine, they pierced the houses, they came over theroofs, the barricade was taken. Not one of the eighty cowards thought offlight, all were killed there with the exception of the leader,Barthélemy, of whom we shall speak presently.</p><p>The Saint-Antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders; the barricade ofthe Temple was silence. The difference between these two redoubts was thedifference between the formidable and the sinister. One seemed a maw; theother a mask.</p><p>Admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of June was composedof a wrath and of an enigma, one divined in the first barricade thedragon, and behind the second the sphinx.</p><p>These two fortresses had been erected by two men named, the one, Cournet,the other, Barthélemy. Cournet made the Saint-Antoine barricade;Barthélemy the barricade of the Temple. Each was the image of the man whohad built it.</p><p>Cournet was a man of lofty stature; he had broad shoulders, a red face, acrushing fist, a bold heart, a loyal soul, a sincere and terrible eye.Intrepid, energetic, irascible, stormy; the most cordial of men, the mostformidable of combatants. War, strife, conflict, were the very air hebreathed and put him in a good humor. He had been an officer in the navy,and, from his gestures and his voice, one divined that he sprang from theocean, and that he came from the tempest; he carried the hurricane on intobattle. With the exception of the genius, there was in Cournet somethingof Danton, as, with the exception of the divinity, there was in Dantonsomething of Hercules.</p><p>Barthélemy, thin, feeble, pale, taciturn, was a sort of tragic streeturchin, who, having had his ears boxed by a policeman, lay in wait forhim, and killed him, and at seventeen was sent to the galleys. He came outand made this barricade.</p><p>Later on, fatal circumstance, in London, proscribed by all, Barthélemyslew Cournet. It was a funereal duel. Some time afterwards, caught in thegearing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passion plays apart, a catastrophe in which French justice sees extenuatingcircumstances, and in which English justice sees only death, Barthélemywas hanged. The sombre social construction is so made that, thanks tomaterial destitution, thanks to moral obscurity, that unhappy being whopossessed an intelligence, certainly firm, possibly great, began in Francewith the galleys, and ended in England with the gallows. Barthélemy, onoccasion, flew but one flag, the black flag.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0300" id="link2HCH0300"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE ABYSS IF ONE DOES NOT CONVERSE</h3><p>Sixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection, andJune, 1848, knew a great deal more about it than June, 1832. So thebarricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie was only an outline, and an embryocompared to the two colossal barricades which we have just sketched; butit was formidable for that epoch.</p><p>The insurgents under the eye of Enjolras, for Marius no longer lookedafter anything, had made good use of the night. The barricade had been notonly repaired, but augmented. They had raised it two feet. Bars of ironplanted in the pavement resembled lances in rest. All sorts of rubbishbrought and added from all directions complicated the external confusion.The redoubt had been cleverly made over, into a wall on the inside and athicket on the outside.</p><p>The staircase of paving-stones which permitted one to mount it like thewall of a citadel had been reconstructed.</p><p>The barricade had been put in order, the tap-room disencumbered, thekitchen appropriated for the ambulance, the dressing of the woundedcompleted, the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had beengathered up, bullets run, cartridges manufactured, lint scraped, thefallen weapons re-distributed, the interior of the redoubt cleaned, therubbish swept up, corpses removed.</p><p>They laid the dead in a heap in the Mondétour lane, of which they werestill the masters. The pavement was red for a long time at that spot.Among the dead there were four National Guardsmen of the suburbs. Enjolrashad their uniforms laid aside.</p><p>Enjolras had advised two hours of sleep. Advice from Enjolras was acommand. Still, only three or four took advantage of it.</p><p>Feuilly employed these two hours in engraving this inscription on the wallwhich faced the tavern:&mdash;</p><p class="center">LONG LIVE THE PEOPLES!</p><p>These four words, hollowed out in the rough stone with a nail, could bestill read on the wall in 1848.</p><p>The three women had profited by the respite of the night to vanishdefinitely; which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely.</p><p>They had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring house.</p><p>The greater part of the wounded were able, and wished, to fight still. Ona litter of mattresses and trusses of straw in the kitchen, which had beenconverted into an ambulance, there were five men gravely wounded, two ofwhom were municipal guardsmen. The municipal guardsmen were attended tofirst.</p><p>In the tap-room there remained only Mabeuf under his black cloth andJavert bound to his post.</p><p>&ldquo;This is the hall of the dead,&rdquo; said Enjolras.</p><p>In the interior of this hall, barely lighted by a candle at one end, themortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bar, a sort ofvast, vague cross resulted from Javert erect and Mabeuf lying prone.</p><p>The pole of the omnibus, although snapped off by the fusillade, was stillsufficiently upright to admit of their fastening the flag to it.</p><p>Enjolras, who possessed that quality of a leader, of always doing what hesaid, attached to this staff the bullet-ridden and bloody coat of the oldman&rsquo;s.</p><p>No repast had been possible. There was neither bread nor meat. The fiftymen in the barricade had speedily exhausted the scanty provisions of thewine-shop during the sixteen hours which they had passed there. At a givenmoment, every barricade inevitably becomes the raft of <i>la Méduse</i>. Theywere obliged to resign themselves to hunger. They had then reached thefirst hours of that Spartan day of the 6th of June when, in the barricadeSaint-Merry, Jeanne, surrounded by the insurgents who demanded bread,replied to all combatants crying: &ldquo;Something to eat!&rdquo; with: &ldquo;Why? It isthree o&rsquo;clock; at four we shall be dead.&rdquo;</p><p>As they could no longer eat, Enjolras forbade them to drink. Heinterdicted wine, and portioned out the brandy.</p><p>They had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed.Enjolras and Combeferre examined them. Combeferre when he came up againsaid:&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the old stock of Father Hucheloup, who began business asa grocer.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It must be real wine,&rdquo; observed Bossuet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s luckythat Grantaire is asleep. If he were on foot, there would be a good dealof difficulty in saving those bottles.&rdquo;&mdash;Enjolras, in spite of allmurmurs, placed his veto on the fifteen bottles, and, in order that no onemight touch them, he had them placed under the table on which FatherMabeuf was lying.</p><p>About two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, they reckoned up their strength. Therewere still thirty-seven of them.</p><p>The day began to dawn. The torch, which had been replaced in its cavity inthe pavement, had just been extinguished. The interior of the barricade,that species of tiny courtyard appropriated from the street, was bathed inshadows, and resembled, athwart the vague, twilight horror, the deck of adisabled ship. The combatants, as they went and came, moved about therelike black forms. Above that terrible nesting-place of gloom the storiesof the mute houses were lividly outlined; at the very top, the chimneysstood palely out. The sky was of that charming, undecided hue, which maybe white and may be blue. Birds flew about in it with cries of joy. Thelofty house which formed the back of the barricade, being turned to theEast, had upon its roof a rosy reflection. The morning breeze ruffled thegray hair on the head of the dead man at the third-story window.</p><p>&ldquo;I am delighted that the torch has been extinguished,&rdquo; said Courfeyrac toFeuilly. &ldquo;That torch flickering in the wind annoyed me. It had theappearance of being afraid. The light of torches resembles the wisdom ofcowards; it gives a bad light because it trembles.&rdquo;</p><p>Dawn awakens minds as it does the birds; all began to talk.</p><p>Joly, perceiving a cat prowling on a gutter, extracted philosophy from it.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the cat?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It is a corrective. The good God, havingmade the mouse, said: &lsquo;Hullo! I have committed a blunder.&rsquo; And so he madethe cat. The cat is the erratum of the mouse. The mouse, plus the cat, isthe proof of creation revised and corrected.&rdquo;</p><p>Combeferre, surrounded by students and artisans, was speaking of the dead,of Jean Prouvaire, of Bahorel, of Mabeuf, and even of Cabuc, and ofEnjolras&rsquo; sad severity. He said:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Harmodius and Aristogiton, Brutus, Chereas, Stephanus, Cromwell,Charlotte Corday, Sand, have all had their moment of agony when it was toolate. Our hearts quiver so, and human life is such a mystery that, even inthe case of a civic murder, even in a murder for liberation, if there besuch a thing, the remorse for having struck a man surpasses the joy ofhaving served the human race.&rdquo;</p><p>And, such are the windings of the exchange of speech, that, a momentlater, by a transition brought about through Jean Prouvaire&rsquo;s verses,Combeferre was comparing the translators of the Georgics, Raux withCournand, Cournand with Delille, pointing out the passages translated byMalfilâtre, particularly the prodigies of Cæsar&rsquo;s death; and at that word,Cæsar, the conversation reverted to Brutus.</p><p>&ldquo;Cæsar,&rdquo; said Combeferre, &ldquo;fell justly. Cicero was severe towards Cæsar,and he was right. That severity is not diatribe. When Zoïlus insultsHomer, when Mævius insults Virgil, when Visé insults Molière, when Popeinsults Shakspeare, when Frederic insults Voltaire, it is an old law ofenvy and hatred which is being carried out; genius attracts insult, greatmen are always more or less barked at. But Zoïlus and Cicero are twodifferent persons. Cicero is an arbiter in thought, just as Brutus is anarbiter by the sword. For my own part, I blame that last justice, theblade; but, antiquity admitted it. Cæsar, the violator of the Rubicon,conferring, as though they came from him, the dignities which emanatedfrom the people, not rising at the entrance of the senate, committed theacts of a king and almost of a tyrant, <i>regia ac pene tyrannica</i>. He was agreat man; so much the worse, or so much the better; the lesson is but themore exalted. His twenty-three wounds touch me less than the spitting inthe face of Jesus Christ. Cæsar is stabbed by the senators; Christ iscuffed by lackeys. One feels the God through the greater outrage.&rdquo;</p><p>Bossuet, who towered above the interlocutors from the summit of a heap ofpaving-stones, exclaimed, rifle in hand:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh Cydathenæum, Oh Myrrhinus, Oh Probalinthus, Oh graces of theÆantides! Oh! Who will grant me to pronounce the verses of Homer like aGreek of Laurium or of Edapteon?&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0301" id="link2HCH0301"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;LIGHT AND SHADOW</h3><p>Enjolras had been to make a reconnaissance. He had made his way outthrough Mondétour lane, gliding along close to the houses.</p><p>The insurgents, we will remark, were full of hope. The manner in whichthey had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them toalmost disdain in advance the attack at dawn. They waited for it with asmile. They had no more doubt as to their success than as to their cause.Moreover, succor was, evidently, on the way to them. They reckoned on it.With that facility of triumphant prophecy which is one of the sources ofstrength in the French combatant, they divided the day which was at handinto three distinct phases. At six o&rsquo;clock in the morning a regiment&ldquo;which had been labored with,&rdquo; would turn; at noon, the insurrection ofall Paris; at sunset, revolution.</p><p>They heard the alarm bell of Saint-Merry, which had not been silent for aninstant since the night before; a proof that the other barricade, thegreat one, Jeanne&rsquo;s, still held out.</p><p>All these hopes were exchanged between the different groups in a sort ofgay and formidable whisper which resembled the warlike hum of a hive ofbees.</p><p>Enjolras reappeared. He returned from his sombre eagle flight into outerdarkness. He listened for a moment to all this joy with folded arms, andone hand on his mouth. Then, fresh and rosy in the growing whiteness ofthe dawn, he said:</p><p>&ldquo;The whole army of Paris is to strike. A third of the army is bearing downupon the barricades in which you now are. There is the National Guard inaddition. I have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the line, and thestandard-bearers of the sixth legion. In one hour you will be attacked. Asfor the populace, it was seething yesterday, to-day it is not stirring.There is nothing to expect; nothing to hope for. Neither from a faubourgnor from a regiment. You are abandoned.&rdquo;</p><p>These words fell upon the buzzing of the groups, and produced on them theeffect caused on a swarm of bees by the first drops of a storm. A momentof indescribable silence ensued, in which death might have been heardflitting by.</p><p>This moment was brief.</p><p>A voice from the obscurest depths of the groups shouted to Enjolras:</p><p>&ldquo;So be it. Let us raise the barricade to a height of twenty feet, and letus all remain in it. Citizens, let us offer the protests of corpses. Letus show that, if the people abandon the republicans, the republicans donot abandon the people.&rdquo;</p><p>These words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud of individualanxieties. It was hailed with an enthusiastic acclamation.</p><p>No one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus; he was someunknown blouse-wearer, a stranger, a man forgotten, a passing hero, thatgreat anonymous, always mingled in human crises and in social geneses who,at a given moment, utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word, and whovanishes into the shadows after having represented for a minute, in alightning flash, the people and God.</p><p>This inexorable resolution so thoroughly impregnated the air of the 6th ofJune, 1832, that, almost at the very same hour, on the barricadeSaint-Merry, the insurgents were raising that clamor which has become amatter of history and which has been consigned to the documents in thecase:&mdash;&ldquo;What matters it whether they come to our assistance or not?Let us get ourselves killed here, to the very last man.&rdquo;</p><p>As the reader sees, the two barricades, though materially isolated, werein communication with each other.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0302" id="link2HCH0302"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;MINUS FIVE, PLUS ONE</h3><p>After the man who decreed the &ldquo;protest of corpses&rdquo; had spoken, and hadgiven this formula of their common soul, there issued from all mouths astrangely satisfied and terrible cry, funereal in sense and triumphant intone:</p><p>&ldquo;Long live death! Let us all remain here!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why all?&rdquo; said Enjolras.</p><p>&ldquo;All! All!&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras resumed:</p><p>&ldquo;The position is good; the barricade is fine. Thirty men are enough. Whysacrifice forty?&rdquo;</p><p>They replied:</p><p>&ldquo;Because not one will go away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Citizens,&rdquo; cried Enjolras, and there was an almost irritated vibration inhis voice, &ldquo;this republic is not rich enough in men to indulge in uselessexpenditure of them. Vain-glory is waste. If the duty of some is todepart, that duty should be fulfilled like any other.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras, the man-principle, had over his co-religionists that sort ofomnipotent power which emanates from the absolute. Still, great as wasthis omnipotence, a murmur arose. A leader to the very finger-tips,Enjolras, seeing that they murmured, insisted. He resumed haughtily:</p><p>&ldquo;Let those who are afraid of not numbering more than thirty say so.&rdquo;</p><p>The murmurs redoubled.</p><p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; observed a voice in one group, &ldquo;it is easy enough to talk aboutleaving. The barricade is hemmed in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not on the side of the Halles,&rdquo; said Enjolras. &ldquo;The Rue Mondétour isfree, and through the Rue des Prêcheurs one can reach the Marché desInnocents.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And there,&rdquo; went on another voice, &ldquo;you would be captured. You would fallin with some grand guard of the line or the suburbs; they will spy a manpassing in blouse and cap. &lsquo;Whence come you?&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you belong to thebarricade?&rsquo; And they will look at your hands. You smell of powder. Shot.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras, without making any reply, touched Combeferre&rsquo;s shoulder, and thetwo entered the tap-room.</p><p>They emerged thence a moment later. Enjolras held in his outstretchedhands the four uniforms which he had laid aside. Combeferre followed,carrying the shoulder-belts and the shakos.</p><p>&ldquo;With this uniform,&rdquo; said Enjolras, &ldquo;you can mingle with the ranks andescape; here is enough for four.&rdquo; And he flung on the ground, deprived ofits pavement, the four uniforms.</p><p>No wavering took place in his stoical audience. Combeferre took the word.</p><p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must have a little pity. Do you know what thequestion is here? It is a question of women. See here. Are there women orare there not? Are there children or are there not? Are there mothers, yesor no, who rock cradles with their foot and who have a lot of little onesaround them? Let that man of you who has never beheld a nurse&rsquo;s breastraise his hand. Ah! you want to get yourselves killed, so do I&mdash;I,who am speaking to you; but I do not want to feel the phantoms of womenwreathing their arms around me. Die, if you will, but don&rsquo;t make othersdie. Suicides like that which is on the brink of accomplishment here aresublime; but suicide is narrow, and does not admit of extension; and assoon as it touches your neighbors, suicide is murder. Think of the littleblond heads; think of the white locks. Listen, Enjolras has just told methat he saw at the corner of the Rue du Cygne a lighted casement, a candlein a poor window, on the fifth floor, and on the pane the quivering shadowof the head of an old woman, who had the air of having spent the night inwatching. Perhaps she is the mother of some one of you. Well, let that mango, and make haste, to say to his mother: &lsquo;Here I am, mother!&rsquo; Let himfeel at ease, the task here will be performed all the same. When onesupports one&rsquo;s relatives by one&rsquo;s toil, one has not the right to sacrificeone&rsquo;s self. That is deserting one&rsquo;s family. And those who have daughters!what are you thinking of? You get yourselves killed, you are dead, that iswell. And tomorrow? Young girls without bread&mdash;that is a terriblething. Man begs, woman sells. Ah! those charming and gracious beings, sogracious and so sweet, who have bonnets of flowers, who fill the housewith purity, who sing and prattle, who are like a living perfume, whoprove the existence of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth,that Jeanne, that Lise, that Mimi, those adorable and honest creatures whoare your blessings and your pride, ah! good God, they will suffer hunger!What do you want me to say to you? There is a market for human flesh; andit is not with your shadowy hands, shuddering around them, that you willprevent them from entering it! Think of the street, think of the pavementcovered with passers-by, think of the shops past which women go and comewith necks all bare, and through the mire. These women, too, were pureonce. Think of your sisters, those of you who have them. Misery,prostitution, the police, Saint-Lazare&mdash;that is what those beautiful,delicate girls, those fragile marvels of modesty, gentleness andloveliness, fresher than lilacs in the month of May, will come to. Ah! youhave got yourselves killed! You are no longer on hand! That is well; youhave wished to release the people from Royalty, and you deliver over yourdaughters to the police. Friends, have a care, have mercy. Women, unhappywomen, we are not in the habit of bestowing much thought on them. We trustto the women not having received a man&rsquo;s education, we prevent theirreading, we prevent their thinking, we prevent their occupying themselveswith politics; will you prevent them from going to the dead-house thisevening, and recognizing your bodies? Let us see, those who have familiesmust be tractable, and shake hands with us and take themselves off, andleave us here alone to attend to this affair. I know well that courage isrequired to leave, that it is hard; but the harder it is, the moremeritorious. You say: &lsquo;I have a gun, I am at the barricade; so much theworse, I shall remain there.&rsquo; So much the worse is easily said. Myfriends, there is a morrow; you will not be here to-morrow, but yourfamilies will; and what sufferings! See, here is a pretty, healthy child,with cheeks like an apple, who babbles, prattles, chatters, who laughs,who smells sweet beneath your kiss,&mdash;and do you know what becomes ofhim when he is abandoned? I have seen one, a very small creature, notaller than that. His father was dead. Poor people had taken him in out ofcharity, but they had bread only for themselves. The child was alwayshungry. It was winter. He did not cry. You could see him approach thestove, in which there was never any fire, and whose pipe, you know, was ofmastic and yellow clay. His breathing was hoarse, his face livid, hislimbs flaccid, his belly prominent. He said nothing. If you spoke to him,he did not answer. He is dead. He was taken to the Necker Hospital, whereI saw him. I was house-surgeon in that hospital. Now, if there are anyfathers among you, fathers whose happiness it is to stroll on Sundaysholding their child&rsquo;s tiny hand in their robust hand, let each one ofthose fathers imagine that this child is his own. That poor brat, Iremember, and I seem to see him now, when he lay nude on the dissectingtable, how his ribs stood out on his skin like the graves beneath thegrass in a cemetery. A sort of mud was found in his stomach. There wereashes in his teeth. Come, let us examine ourselves conscientiously andtake counsel with our heart. Statistics show that the mortality amongabandoned children is fifty-five per cent. I repeat, it is a question ofwomen, it concerns mothers, it concerns young girls, it concerns littlechildren. Who is talking to you of yourselves? We know well what you are;we know well that you are all brave, parbleu! we know well that you allhave in your souls the joy and the glory of giving your life for the greatcause; we know well that you feel yourselves elected to die usefully andmagnificently, and that each one of you clings to his share in thetriumph. Very well. But you are not alone in this world. There are otherbeings of whom you must think. You must not be egoists.&rdquo;</p><p>All dropped their heads with a gloomy air.</p><p>Strange contradictions of the human heart at its most sublime moments.Combeferre, who spoke thus, was not an orphan. He recalled the mothers ofother men, and forgot his own. He was about to get himself killed. He was&ldquo;an egoist.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius, fasting, fevered, having emerged in succession from all hope, andhaving been stranded in grief, the most sombre of shipwrecks, andsaturated with violent emotions and conscious that the end was near, hadplunged deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor which always precedesthe fatal hour voluntarily accepted.</p><p>A physiologist might have studied in him the growing symptoms of thatfebrile absorption known to, and classified by, science, and which is tosuffering what voluptuousness is to pleasure. Despair, also, has itsecstasy. Marius had reached this point. He looked on at everything as fromwithout; as we have said, things which passed before him seemed far away;he made out the whole, but did not perceive the details. He beheld mengoing and coming as through a flame. He heard voices speaking as at thebottom of an abyss.</p><p>But this moved him. There was in this scene a point which pierced androused even him. He had but one idea now, to die; and he did not wish tobe turned aside from it, but he reflected, in his gloomy somnambulism,that while destroying himself, he was not prohibited from saving some oneelse.</p><p>He raised his voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Enjolras and Combeferre are right,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;no unnecessary sacrifice. Ijoin them, and you must make haste. Combeferre has said convincing thingsto you. There are some among you who have families, mothers, sisters,wives, children. Let such leave the ranks.&rdquo;</p><p>No one stirred.</p><p>&ldquo;Married men and the supporters of families, step out of the ranks!&rdquo; repeated Marius.</p><p>His authority was great. Enjolras was certainly the head of the barricade,but Marius was its savior.</p><p>&ldquo;I order it,&rdquo; cried Enjolras.</p><p>&ldquo;I entreat you,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>Then, touched by Combeferre&rsquo;s words, shaken by Enjolras&rsquo; order, touched byMarius&rsquo; entreaty, these heroic men began to denounce each other.&mdash;&ldquo;Itis true,&rdquo; said one young man to a full grown man, &ldquo;you are the father of afamily. Go.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It is your duty rather,&rdquo; retorted the man, &ldquo;you havetwo sisters whom you maintain.&rdquo;&mdash;And an unprecedented controversybroke forth. Each struggled to determine which should not allow himself tobe placed at the door of the tomb.</p><p>&ldquo;Make haste,&rdquo; said Courfeyrac, &ldquo;in another quarter of an hour it will betoo late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Citizens,&rdquo; pursued Enjolras, &ldquo;this is the Republic, and universalsuffrage reigns. Do you yourselves designate those who are to go.&rdquo;</p><p>They obeyed. After the expiration of a few minutes, five were unanimouslyselected and stepped out of the ranks.</p><p>&ldquo;There are five of them!&rdquo; exclaimed Marius.</p><p>There were only four uniforms.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began the five, &ldquo;one must stay behind.&rdquo;</p><p>And then a struggle arose as to who should remain, and who should findreasons for the others not remaining. The generous quarrel began afresh.</p><p>&ldquo;You have a wife who loves you.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You have your aged mother.&rdquo;&mdash;&rdquo; You have neither father nor mother, and what is to become of your threelittle brothers?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;You are the father of five children.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Youhave a right to live, you are only seventeen, it is too early for you todie.&rdquo;</p><p>These great revolutionary barricades were assembling points for heroism.The improbable was simple there. These men did not astonish each other.</p><p>&ldquo;Be quick,&rdquo; repeated Courfeyrac.</p><p>Men shouted to Marius from the groups:</p><p>&ldquo;Do you designate who is to remain.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the five, &ldquo;choose. We will obey you.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius did not believe that he was capable of another emotion. Still, atthis idea, that of choosing a man for death, his blood rushed back to hisheart. He would have turned pale, had it been possible for him to becomeany paler.</p><p>He advanced towards the five, who smiled upon him, and each, with his eyesfull of that grand flame which one beholds in the depths of historyhovering over Thermopylæ, cried to him:</p><p>&ldquo;Me! me! me!&rdquo;</p><p>And Marius stupidly counted them; there were still five of them! Then hisglance dropped to the four uniforms.</p><p>At that moment, a fifth uniform fell, as if from heaven, upon the otherfour.</p><p>The fifth man was saved.</p><p>Marius raised his eyes and recognized M. Fauchelevent.</p><p>Jean Valjean had just entered the barricade.</p><p>He had arrived by way of Mondétour lane, whither by dint of inquiriesmade, or by instinct, or chance. Thanks to his dress of a NationalGuardsman, he had made his way without difficulty.</p><p>The sentinel stationed by the insurgents in the Rue Mondétour had nooccasion to give the alarm for a single National Guardsman, and he hadallowed the latter to entangle himself in the street, saying to himself:&ldquo;Probably it is a reinforcement, in any case it is a prisoner.&rdquo; The momentwas too grave to admit of the sentinel abandoning his duty and his post ofobservation.</p><p>At the moment when Jean Valjean entered the redoubt, no one had noticedhim, all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men and the four uniforms.Jean Valjean also had seen and heard, and he had silently removed his coatand flung it on the pile with the rest.</p><p>The emotion aroused was indescribable.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is this man?&rdquo; demanded Bossuet.</p><p>&ldquo;He is a man who saves others,&rdquo; replied Combeferre.</p><p>Marius added in a grave voice:</p><p>&ldquo;I know him.&rdquo;</p><p>This guarantee satisfied every one.</p><p>Enjolras turned to Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;Welcome, citizen.&rdquo;</p><p>And he added:</p><p>&ldquo;You know that we are about to die.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean, without replying, helped the insurgent whom he was saving todon his uniform.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0303" id="link2HCH0303"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;THE HORIZON WHICH ONE BEHOLDS FROM THE SUMMIT OF ABARRICADE</h3><p>The situation of all in that fatal hour and that pitiless place, had asresult and culminating point Enjolras&rsquo; supreme melancholy.</p><p>Enjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution; he wasincomplete, however, so far as the absolute can be so; he had too much ofSaint-Just about him, and not enough of Anacharsis Cloots; still, hismind, in the society of the Friends of the A B C, had ended by undergoinga certain polarization from Combeferre&rsquo;s ideas; for some time past, he hadbeen gradually emerging from the narrow form of dogma, and had allowedhimself to incline to the broadening influence of progress, and he hadcome to accept, as a definitive and magnificent evolution, thetransformation of the great French Republic, into the immense humanrepublic. As far as the immediate means were concerned, a violentsituation being given, he wished to be violent; on that point, he nevervaried; and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school which issummed up in the words: &ldquo;Eighty-three.&rdquo; Enjolras was standing erect on thestaircase of paving-stones, one elbow resting on the stock of his gun. Hewas engaged in thought; he quivered, as at the passage of propheticbreaths; places where death is have these effects of tripods. A sort ofstifled fire darted from his eyes, which were filled with an inward look.All at once he threw back his head, his blond locks fell back like thoseof an angel on the sombre quadriga made of stars, they were like the maneof a startled lion in the flaming of an halo, and Enjolras cried:</p><p>&ldquo;Citizens, do you picture the future to yourselves? The streets of citiesinundated with light, green branches on the thresholds, nations sisters,men just, old men blessing children, the past loving the present, thinkersentirely at liberty, believers on terms of full equality, for religionheaven, God the direct priest, human conscience become an altar, no morehatreds, the fraternity of the workshop and the school, for sole penaltyand recompense fame, work for all, right for all, peace over all, no morebloodshed, no more wars, happy mothers! To conquer matter is the firststep; to realize the ideal is the second. Reflect on what progress hasalready accomplished. Formerly, the first human races beheld with terrorthe hydra pass before their eyes, breathing on the waters, the dragonwhich vomited flame, the griffin who was the monster of the air, and whoflew with the wings of an eagle and the talons of a tiger; fearful beastswhich were above man. Man, nevertheless, spread his snares, consecrated byintelligence, and finally conquered these monsters. We have vanquished thehydra, and it is called the locomotive; we are on the point of vanquishingthe griffin, we already grasp it, and it is called the balloon. On the daywhen this Promethean task shall be accomplished, and when man shall havedefinitely harnessed to his will the triple Chimæra of antiquity, thehydra, the dragon and the griffin, he will be the master of water, fire,and of air, and he will be for the rest of animated creation that whichthe ancient gods formerly were to him. Courage, and onward! Citizens,whither are we going? To science made government, to the force of thingsbecome the sole public force, to the natural law, having in itself itssanction and its penalty and promulgating itself by evidence, to a dawn oftruth corresponding to a dawn of day. We are advancing to the union ofpeoples; we are advancing to the unity of man. No more fictions; no moreparasites. The real governed by the true, that is the goal. Civilizationwill hold its assizes at the summit of Europe, and, later on, at thecentre of continents, in a grand parliament of the intelligence. Somethingsimilar has already been seen. The amphictyons had two sittings a year,one at Delphos the seat of the gods, the other at Thermopylæ, the placeof heroes. Europe will have her amphictyons; the globe will have itsamphictyons. France bears this sublime future in her breast. This is thegestation of the nineteenth century. That which Greece sketched out isworthy of being finished by France. Listen to me, you, Feuilly, valiantartisan, man of the people. I revere you. Yes, you clearly behold thefuture, yes, you are right. You had neither father nor mother, Feuilly;you adopted humanity for your mother and right for your father. You areabout to die, that is to say to triumph, here. Citizens, whatever happensto-day, through our defeat as well as through our victory, it is arevolution that we are about to create. As conflagrations light up a wholecity, so revolutions illuminate the whole human race. And what is therevolution that we shall cause? I have just told you, the Revolution ofthe True. From a political point of view, there is but a single principle;the sovereignty of man over himself. This sovereignty of myself overmyself is called Liberty. Where two or three of these sovereignties arecombined, the state begins. But in that association there is noabdication. Each sovereignty concedes a certain quantity of itself, forthe purpose of forming the common right. This quantity is the same for allof us. This identity of concession which each makes to all, is calledEquality. Common right is nothing else than the protection of all beamingon the right of each. This protection of all over each is calledFraternity. The point of intersection of all these assembled sovereigntiesis called society. This intersection being a junction, this point is aknot. Hence what is called the social bond. Some say social contract;which is the same thing, the word contract being etymologically formedwith the idea of a bond. Let us come to an understanding about equality;for, if liberty is the summit, equality is the base. Equality, citizens,is not wholly a surface vegetation, a society of great blades of grass andtiny oaks; a proximity of jealousies which render each other null andvoid; legally speaking, it is all aptitudes possessed of the sameopportunity; politically, it is all votes possessed of the same weight;religiously, it is all consciences possessed of the same right. Equalityhas an organ: gratuitous and obligatory instruction. The right to thealphabet, that is where the beginning must be made. The primary schoolimposed on all, the secondary school offered to all, that is the law. Froman identical school, an identical society will spring. Yes, instruction!light! light! everything comes from light, and to it everything returns.Citizens, the nineteenth century is great, but the twentieth century willbe happy. Then, there will be nothing more like the history of old, weshall no longer, as to-day, have to fear a conquest, an invasion, ausurpation, a rivalry of nations, arms in hand, an interruption ofcivilization depending on a marriage of kings, on a birth in hereditarytyrannies, a partition of peoples by a congress, a dismemberment becauseof the failure of a dynasty, a combat of two religions meeting face toface, like two bucks in the dark, on the bridge of the infinite; we shallno longer have to fear famine, farming out, prostitution arising fromdistress, misery from the failure of work and the scaffold and the sword,and battles and the ruffianism of chance in the forest of events. Onemight almost say: There will be no more events. We shall be happy. Thehuman race will accomplish its law, as the terrestrial globe accomplishesits law; harmony will be re-established between the soul and the star; thesoul will gravitate around the truth, as the planet around the light.Friends, the present hour in which I am addressing you, is a gloomy hour;but these are terrible purchases of the future. A revolution is a toll.Oh! the human race will be delivered, raised up, consoled! We affirm it onthis barrier. Whence should proceed that cry of love, if not from theheights of sacrifice? Oh my brothers, this is the point of junction, ofthose who think and of those who suffer; this barricade is not made ofpaving-stones, nor of joists, nor of bits of iron; it is made of twoheaps, a heap of ideas, and a heap of woes. Here misery meets the ideal.The day embraces the night, and says to it: &lsquo;I am about to die, and thoushalt be born again with me.&rsquo; From the embrace of all desolations faithleaps forth. Sufferings bring hither their agony and ideas theirimmortality. This agony and this immortality are about to join andconstitute our death. Brothers, he who dies here dies in the radiance ofthe future, and we are entering a tomb all flooded with the dawn.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras paused rather than became silent; his lips continued to movesilently, as though he were talking to himself, which caused them all togaze attentively at him, in the endeavor to hear more. There was noapplause; but they whispered together for a long time. Speech being abreath, the rustling of intelligences resembles the rustling of leaves.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0304" id="link2HCH0304"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;MARIUS HAGGARD, JAVERT LACONIC</h3><p>Let us narrate what was passing in Marius&rsquo; thoughts.</p><p>Let the reader recall the state of his soul. We have just recalled it,everything was a vision to him now. His judgment was disturbed. Marius,let us insist on this point, was under the shadow of the great, dark wingswhich are spread over those in the death agony. He felt that he hadentered the tomb, it seemed to him that he was already on the other sideof the wall, and he no longer beheld the faces of the living except withthe eyes of one dead.</p><p>How did M. Fauchelevent come there? Why was he there? What had he comethere to do? Marius did not address all these questions to himself.Besides, since our despair has this peculiarity, that it envelops othersas well as ourselves, it seemed logical to him that all the world shouldcome thither to die.</p><p>Only, he thought of Cosette with a pang at his heart.</p><p>However, M. Fauchelevent did not speak to him, did not look at him, andhad not even the air of hearing him, when Marius raised his voice to say:&ldquo;I know him.&rdquo;</p><p>As far as Marius was concerned, this attitude of M. Fauchelevent wascomforting, and, if such a word can be used for such impressions, weshould say that it pleased him. He had always felt the absoluteimpossibility of addressing that enigmatical man, who was, in his eyes,both equivocal and imposing. Moreover, it had been a long time since hehad seen him; and this still further augmented the impossibility forMarius&rsquo; timid and reserved nature.</p><p>The five chosen men left the barricade by way of Mondétour lane; they borea perfect resemblance to members of the National Guard. One of them weptas he took his leave. Before setting out, they embraced those whoremained.</p><p>When the five men sent back to life had taken their departure, Enjolrasthought of the man who had been condemned to death.</p><p>He entered the tap-room. Javert, still bound to the post, was engaged inmeditation.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want anything?&rdquo; Enjolras asked him.</p><p>Javert replied: &ldquo;When are you going to kill me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Wait. We need all our cartridges just at present.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then give me a drink,&rdquo; said Javert.</p><p>Enjolras himself offered him a glass of water, and, as Javert waspinioned, he helped him to drink.</p><p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; inquired Enjolras.</p><p>&ldquo;I am uncomfortable against this post,&rdquo; replied Javert. &ldquo;You are nottender to have left me to pass the night here. Bind me as you please, butyou surely might lay me out on a table like that other man.&rdquo;</p><p>And with a motion of the head, he indicated the body of M. Mabeuf.</p><p>There was, as the reader will remember, a long, broad table at the end ofthe room, on which they had been running bullets and making cartridges.All the cartridges having been made, and all the powder used, this tablewas free.</p><p>At Enjolras&rsquo; command, four insurgents unbound Javert from the post. Whilethey were loosing him, a fifth held a bayonet against his breast.</p><p>Leaving his arms tied behind his back, they placed about his feet aslender but stout whip-cord, as is done to men on the point of mountingthe scaffold, which allowed him to take steps about fifteen inches inlength, and made him walk to the table at the end of the room, where theylaid him down, closely bound about the middle of the body.</p><p>By way of further security, and by means of a rope fastened to his neck,they added to the system of ligatures which rendered every attempt atescape impossible, that sort of bond which is called in prisons amartingale, which, starting at the neck, forks on the stomach, and meetsthe hands, after passing between the legs.</p><p>While they were binding Javert, a man standing on the threshold wassurveying him with singular attention. The shadow cast by this man madeJavert turn his head. He raised his eyes, and recognized Jean Valjean.

Not a window was opened, not a doorstood ajar; it was the dawn but not the awaking. The end of the Rue de laChanvrerie, opposite the barricade, had been evacuated by the troops, aswe have stated, it seemed to be free, and presented itself to passers-bywith a sinister tranquillity. The Rue Saint-Denis was as dumb as theavenue of Sphinxes at Thebes. Not a living being in the crossroads, whichgleamed white in the light of the sun. Nothing is so mournful as thislight in deserted streets. Nothing was to be seen, but there was somethingto be heard. A mysterious movement was going on at a certain distance. Itwas evident that the critical moment was approaching. As on the previousevening, the sentinels had come in; but this time all had come.</p><p>The barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack. Sincethe departure of the five, they had increased its height still further.</p><p>On the advice of the sentinel who had examined the region of the Halles,Enjolras, for fear of a surprise in the rear, came to a serious decision.He had the small gut of the Mondétour lane, which had been left open up tothat time, barricaded. For this purpose, they tore up the pavement for thelength of several houses more. In this manner, the barricade, walled onthree streets, in front on the Rue de la Chanvrerie, to the left on theRues du Cygne and de la Petite Truanderie, to the right on the RueMondétour, was really almost impregnable; it is true that they werefatally hemmed in there. It had three fronts, but no exit.&mdash;&ldquo;Afortress but a rat hole too,&rdquo; said Courfeyrac with a laugh.</p><p>Enjolras had about thirty paving-stones &ldquo;torn up in excess,&rdquo; said Bossuet,piled up near the door of the wine-shop.</p><p>The silence was now so profound in the quarter whence the attack mustneeds come, that Enjolras had each man resume his post of battle.</p><p>An allowance of brandy was doled out to each.</p><p>Nothing is more curious than a barricade preparing for an assault. Eachman selects his place as though at the theatre. They jostle, and elbow andcrowd each other. There are some who make stalls of paving-stones. Here isa corner of the wall which is in the way, it is removed; here is a redanwhich may afford protection, they take shelter behind it. Left-handed menare precious; they take the places that are inconvenient to the rest. Manyarrange to fight in a sitting posture. They wish to be at ease to kill,and to die comfortably. In the sad war of June, 1848, an insurgent who wasa formidable marksman, and who was firing from the top of a terrace upon aroof, had a reclining-chair brought there for his use; a charge ofgrape-shot found him out there.</p><p>As soon as the leader has given the order to clear the decks for action,all disorderly movements cease; there is no more pulling from one another;there are no more coteries; no more asides, there is no more holdingaloof; everything in their spirits converges in, and changes into, awaiting for the assailants. A barricade before the arrival of danger ischaos; in danger, it is discipline itself. Peril produces order.</p><p>As soon as Enjolras had seized his double-barrelled rifle, and had placedhimself in a sort of embrasure which he had reserved for himself, all therest held their peace. A series of faint, sharp noises resoundedconfusedly along the wall of paving-stones. It was the men cocking theirguns.</p><p>Moreover, their attitudes were prouder, more confident than ever; theexcess of sacrifice strengthens; they no longer cherished any hope, butthey had despair, despair,&mdash;the last weapon, which sometimes givesvictory; Virgil has said so. Supreme resources spring from extremeresolutions. To embark in death is sometimes the means of escaping ashipwreck; and the lid of the coffin becomes a plank of safety.</p><p>As on the preceding evening, the attention of all was directed, we mightalmost say leaned upon, the end of the street, now lighted up and visible.</p><p>They had not long to wait. A stir began distinctly in the Saint-Leuquarter, but it did not resemble the movement of the first attack. Aclashing of chains, the uneasy jolting of a mass, the click of brassskipping along the pavement, a sort of solemn uproar, announced that somesinister construction of iron was approaching. There arose a tremor in thebosoms of these peaceful old streets, pierced and built for the fertilecirculation of interests and ideas, and which are not made for thehorrible rumble of the wheels of war.</p><p>The fixity of eye in all the combatants upon the extremity of the streetbecame ferocious.</p><p>A cannon made its appearance.</p><p>Artillery-men were pushing the piece; it was in firing trim; thefore-carriage had been detached; two upheld the gun-carriage, four were atthe wheels; others followed with the caisson. They could see the smoke ofthe burning lint-stock.</p><p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; shouted Enjolras.</p><p>The whole barricade fired, the report was terrible; an avalanche of smokecovered and effaced both cannon and men; after a few seconds, the clouddispersed, and the cannon and men reappeared; the gun-crew had justfinished rolling it slowly, correctly, without haste, into position facingthe barricade. Not one of them had been struck. Then the captain of thepiece, bearing down upon the breech in order to raise the muzzle, began topoint the cannon with the gravity of an astronomer levelling a telescope.</p><p>&ldquo;Bravo for the cannoneers!&rdquo; cried Bossuet.</p><p>And the whole barricade clapped their hands.</p><p>A moment later, squarely planted in the very middle of the street, astrideof the gutter, the piece was ready for action. A formidable pair of jawsyawned on the barricade.</p><p>&ldquo;Come, merrily now!&rdquo; ejaculated Courfeyrac. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the brutal part of it.After the fillip on the nose, the blow from the fist. The army is reachingout its big paw to us. The barricade is going to be severely shaken up.The fusillade tries, the cannon takes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is a piece of eight, new model, brass,&rdquo; added Combeferre. &ldquo;Thosepieces are liable to burst as soon as the proportion of ten parts of tinto one hundred of brass is exceeded. The excess of tin renders them tootender. Then it comes to pass that they have caves and chambers whenlooked at from the vent hole. In order to obviate this danger, and torender it possible to force the charge, it may become necessary to returnto the process of the fourteenth century, hooping, and to encircle thepiece on the outside with a series of unwelded steel bands, from thebreech to the trunnions. In the meantime, they remedy this defect as bestthey may; they manage to discover where the holes are located in the ventof a cannon, by means of a searcher. But there is a better method, withGribeauval&rsquo;s movable star.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the sixteenth century,&rdquo; remarked Bossuet, &ldquo;they used to rifle cannon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Combeferre, &ldquo;that augments the projectile force, butdiminishes the accuracy of the firing. In firing at short range, thetrajectory is not as rigid as could be desired, the parabola isexaggerated, the line of the projectile is no longer sufficientlyrectilinear to allow of its striking intervening objects, which is,nevertheless, a necessity of battle, the importance of which increaseswith the proximity of the enemy and the precipitation of the discharge.This defect of the tension of the curve of the projectile in the rifledcannon of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness of the charge;small charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballisticnecessities, such, for instance, as the preservation of the gun-carriage.In short, that despot, the cannon, cannot do all that it desires; force isa great weakness. A cannon-ball only travels six hundred leagues an hour;light travels seventy thousand leagues a second. Such is the superiorityof Jesus Christ over Napoleon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Reload your guns,&rdquo; said Enjolras.</p><p>How was the casing of the barricade going to behave under thecannon-balls? Would they effect a breach? That was the question. While theinsurgents were reloading their guns, the artillery-men were loading thecannon.</p><p>The anxiety in the redoubt was profound.</p><p>The shot sped the report burst forth.</p><p>&ldquo;Present!&rdquo; shouted a joyous voice.</p><p>And Gavroche flung himself into the barricade just as the ball dashedagainst it.</p><p>He came from the direction of the Rue du Cygne, and he had nimbly climbedover the auxiliary barricade which fronted on the labyrinth of the Rue dela Petite Truanderie.</p><p>Gavroche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than thecannon-ball.</p><p>The ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish. At the most there was anomnibus wheel broken, and the old Anceau cart was demolished. On seeingthis, the barricade burst into a laugh.</p><p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; shouted Bossuet to the artillerists.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0306" id="link2HCH0306"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE ARTILLERY-MEN COMPEL PEOPLE TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY</h3><p>They flocked round Gavroche. But he had no time to tell anything. Mariusdrew him aside with a shudder.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;what are you doing here yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>And he stared at Marius intently with his epic effrontery. His eyes grewlarger with the proud light within them.</p><p>It was with an accent of severity that Marius continued:</p><p>&ldquo;Who told you to come back? Did you deliver my letter at the address?&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche was not without some compunctions in the matter of that letter.In his haste to return to the barricade, he had got rid of it rather thandelivered it. He was forced to acknowledge to himself that he had confidedit rather lightly to that stranger whose face he had not been able to makeout. It is true that the man was bareheaded, but that was not sufficient.In short, he had been administering to himself little inward remonstrancesand he feared Marius&rsquo; reproaches. In order to extricate himself from thepredicament, he took the simplest course; he lied abominably.</p><p>&ldquo;Citizen, I delivered the letter to the porter. The lady was asleep. Shewill have the letter when she wakes up.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius had had two objects in sending that letter: to bid farewell toCosette and to save Gavroche. He was obliged to content himself with thehalf of his desire.</p><p>The despatch of his letter and the presence of M. Fauchelevent in thebarricade, was a coincidence which occurred to him. He pointed out M.Fauchelevent to Gavroche.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know that man?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gavroche.</p><p>Gavroche had, in fact, as we have just mentioned, seen Jean Valjean onlyat night.</p><p>The troubled and unhealthy conjectures which had outlined themselves inMarius&rsquo; mind were dissipated. Did he know M. Fauchelevent&rsquo;s opinions?Perhaps M. Fauchelevent was a republican. Hence his very natural presencein this combat.</p><p>In the meanwhile, Gavroche was shouting, at the other end of thebarricade: &ldquo;My gun!&rdquo;</p><p>Courfeyrac had it returned to him.</p><p>Gavroche warned &ldquo;his comrades&rdquo; as he called them, that the barricade wasblocked. He had had great difficulty in reaching it. A battalion of theline whose arms were piled in the Rue de la Petite Truanderie was on thewatch on the side of the Rue du Cygne; on the opposite side, the municipalguard occupied the Rue des Prêcheurs. The bulk of the army was facing themin front.</p><p>This information given, Gavroche added:</p><p>&ldquo;I authorize you to hit &rsquo;em a tremendous whack.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, Enjolras was straining his ears and watching at his embrasure.</p><p>The assailants, dissatisfied, no doubt, with their shot, had not repeatedit.</p><p>A company of infantry of the line had come up and occupied the end of thestreet behind the piece of ordnance. The soldiers were tearing up thepavement and constructing with the stones a small, low wall, a sort ofside-work not more than eighteen inches high, and facing the barricade. Inthe angle at the left of this epaulement, there was visible the head ofthe column of a battalion from the suburbs massed in the Rue Saint-Denis.</p><p>Enjolras, on the watch, thought he distinguished the peculiar sound whichis produced when the shells of grape-shot are drawn from the caissons, andhe saw the commander of the piece change the elevation and incline themouth of the cannon slightly to the left. Then the cannoneers began toload the piece. The chief seized the lint-stock himself and lowered it tothe vent.</p><p>&ldquo;Down with your heads, hug the wall!&rdquo; shouted Enjolras, &ldquo;and all on yourknees along the barricade!&rdquo;</p><p>The insurgents who were straggling in front of the wine-shop, and who hadquitted their posts of combat on Gavroche&rsquo;s arrival, rushed pell-melltowards the barricade; but before Enjolras&rsquo; order could be executed, thedischarge took place with the terrifying rattle of a round of grape-shot.This is what it was, in fact.</p><p>The charge had been aimed at the cut in the redoubt, and had thererebounded from the wall; and this terrible rebound had produced two deadand three wounded.</p><p>If this were continued, the barricade was no longer tenable. Thegrape-shot made its way in.</p><p>A murmur of consternation arose.</p><p>&ldquo;Let us prevent the second discharge,&rdquo; said Enjolras.</p><p>And, lowering his rifle, he took aim at the captain of the gun, who, atthat moment, was bearing down on the breach of his gun and rectifying anddefinitely fixing its pointing.</p><p>The captain of the piece was a handsome sergeant of artillery, very young,blond, with a very gentle face, and the intelligent air peculiar to thatpredestined and redoubtable weapon which, by dint of perfecting itself inhorror, must end in killing war.</p><p>Combeferre, who was standing beside Enjolras, scrutinized this young man.</p><p>&ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; said Combeferre. &ldquo;What hideous things these butcheries are!Come, when there are no more kings, there will be no more war. Enjolras,you are taking aim at that sergeant, you are not looking at him. Fancy, heis a charming young man; he is intrepid; it is evident that he isthoughtful; those young artillery-men are very well educated; he has afather, a mother, a family; he is probably in love; he is not more thanfive and twenty at the most; he might be your brother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Enjolras.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Combeferre, &ldquo;he is mine too. Well, let us not kill him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Let me alone. It must be done.&rdquo;</p><p>And a tear trickled slowly down Enjolras&rsquo; marble cheek.</p><p>At the same moment, he pressed the trigger of his rifle. The flame leapedforth. The artillery-man turned round twice, his arms extended in front ofhim, his head uplifted, as though for breath, then he fell with his sideon the gun, and lay there motionless. They could see his back, from thecentre of which there flowed directly a stream of blood. The ball hadtraversed his breast from side to side. He was dead.</p><p>He had to be carried away and replaced by another. Several minutes werethus gained, in fact.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0307" id="link2HCH0307"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;EMPLOYMENT OF THE OLD TALENTS OF A POACHER AND THATINFALLIBLE MARKSMANSHIP WHICH INFLUENCED THE CONDEMNATION OF 1796</h3><p>Opinions were exchanged in the barricade. The firing from the gun wasabout to begin again. Against that grape-shot, they could not hold out aquarter of an hour longer. It was absolutely necessary to deaden theblows.</p><p>Enjolras issued this command:</p><p>&ldquo;We must place a mattress there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We have none,&rdquo; said Combeferre, &ldquo;the wounded are lying on them.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean, who was seated apart on a stone post, at the corner of thetavern, with his gun between his knees, had, up to that moment, taken nopart in anything that was going on. He did not appear to hear thecombatants saying around him: &ldquo;Here is a gun that is doing nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>At the order issued by Enjolras, he rose.</p><p>It will be remembered that, on the arrival of the rabble in the Rue de laChanvrerie, an old woman, foreseeing the bullets, had placed her mattressin front of her window. This window, an attic window, was on the roof of asix-story house situated a little beyond the barricade. The mattress,placed cross-wise, supported at the bottom on two poles for drying linen,was upheld at the top by two ropes, which, at that distance, looked liketwo threads, and which were attached to two nails planted in the windowframes. These ropes were distinctly visible, like hairs, against the sky.</p><p>&ldquo;Can some one lend me a double-barrelled rifle?&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>Enjolras, who had just re-loaded his, handed it to him.</p><p>Jean Valjean took aim at the attic window and fired.</p><p>One of the mattress ropes was cut.</p><p>The mattress now hung by one thread only.</p><p>Jean Valjean fired the second charge. The second rope lashed the panes ofthe attic window. The mattress slipped between the two poles and fell intothe street.</p><p>The barricade applauded.</p><p>All voices cried:</p><p>&ldquo;Here is a mattress!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Combeferre, &ldquo;but who will go and fetch it?&rdquo;</p><p>The mattress had, in fact, fallen outside the barricade, between besiegersand besieged. Now, the death of the sergeant of artillery havingexasperated the troop, the soldiers had, for several minutes, been lyingflat on their stomachs behind the line of paving-stones which they haderected, and, in order to supply the forced silence of the piece, whichwas quiet while its service was in course of reorganization, they hadopened fire on the barricade. The insurgents did not reply to thismusketry, in order to spare their ammunition. The fusillade broke againstthe barricade; but the street, which it filled, was terrible.</p><p>Jean Valjean stepped out of the cut, entered the street, traversed thestorm of bullets, walked up to the mattress, hoisted it upon his back, andreturned to the barricade.</p><p>He placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands. He fixed it thereagainst the wall in such a manner that the artillery-men should not seeit.</p><p>That done, they awaited the next discharge of grape-shot.</p><p>It was not long in coming.</p><p>The cannon vomited forth its package of buckshot with a roar. But therewas no rebound. The effect which they had foreseen had been attained. Thebarricade was saved.</p><p>&ldquo;Citizen,&rdquo; said Enjolras to Jean Valjean, &ldquo;the Republic thanks you.&rdquo;</p><p>Bossuet admired and laughed. He exclaimed:</p><p>&ldquo;It is immoral that a mattress should have so much power. Triumph of thatwhich yields over that which strikes with lightning.

She had not been thereon the preceding evening, and she had already retired to her chamber whenToussaint had said:</p><p>&ldquo;It appears that there is a row.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette had slept only a few hours, but soundly. She had had sweet dreams,which possibly arose from the fact that her little bed was very white.Some one, who was Marius, had appeared to her in the light. She awoke withthe sun in her eyes, which, at first, produced on her the effect of beinga continuation of her dream. Her first thought on emerging from this dreamwas a smiling one. Cosette felt herself thoroughly reassured. Like JeanValjean, she had, a few hours previously, passed through that reaction ofthe soul which absolutely will not hear of unhappiness. She began tocherish hope, with all her might, without knowing why. Then she felt apang at her heart. It was three days since she had seen Marius. But shesaid to herself that he must have received her letter, that he knew whereshe was, and that he was so clever that he would find means of reachingher.&mdash;And that certainly to-day, and perhaps that very morning.&mdash;Itwas broad daylight, but the rays of light were very horizontal; shethought that it was very early, but that she must rise, nevertheless, inorder to receive Marius.</p><p>She felt that she could not live without Marius, and that, consequently,that was sufficient and that Marius would come. No objection was valid.All this was certain. It was monstrous enough already to have suffered forthree days. Marius absent three days, this was horrible on the part of thegood God. Now, this cruel teasing from on high had been gone through with.Marius was about to arrive, and he would bring good news. Youth is madethus; it quickly dries its eyes; it finds sorrow useless and does notaccept it. Youth is the smile of the future in the presence of an unknownquantity, which is itself. It is natural to it to be happy. It seems asthough its respiration were made of hope.</p><p>Moreover, Cosette could not remember what Marius had said to her on thesubject of this absence which was to last only one day, and whatexplanation of it he had given her. Every one has noticed with whatnimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls away andhides, and with what art it renders itself undiscoverable. There arethoughts which play us the same trick; they nestle away in a corner of ourbrain; that is the end of them; they are lost; it is impossible to lay thememory on them. Cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless little effortmade by her memory. She told herself, that it was very naughty and verywicked of her, to have forgotten the words uttered by Marius.</p><p>She sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul and body,her prayers and her toilet.</p><p>One may, in a case of exigency, introduce the reader into a nuptialchamber, not into a virginal chamber. Verse would hardly venture it, prosemust not.</p><p>It is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded, it is whitenessin the dark, it is the private cell of a closed lily, which must not begazed upon by man so long as the sun has not gazed upon it. Woman in thebud is sacred. That innocent bud which opens, that adorable half-nuditywhich is afraid of itself, that white foot which takes refuge in aslipper, that throat which veils itself before a mirror as though a mirrorwere an eye, that chemise which makes haste to rise up and conceal theshoulder for a creaking bit of furniture or a passing vehicle, those cordstied, those clasps fastened, those laces drawn, those tremors, thoseshivers of cold and modesty, that exquisite affright in every movement,that almost winged uneasiness where there is no cause for alarm, thesuccessive phases of dressing, as charming as the clouds of dawn,&mdash;itis not fitting that all this should be narrated, and it is too much tohave even called attention to it.</p><p>The eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the rising of ayoung girl than in the presence of the rising of a star. The possibilityof hurting should inspire an augmentation of respect. The down on thepeach, the bloom on the plum, the radiated crystal of the snow, the wingof the butterfly powdered with feathers, are coarse compared to thatchastity which does not even know that it is chaste. The young girl isonly the flash of a dream, and is not yet a statue. Her bed-chamber ishidden in the sombre part of the ideal. The indiscreet touch of a glancebrutalizes this vague penumbra. Here, contemplation is profanation.</p><p>We shall, therefore, show nothing of that sweet little flutter ofCosette&rsquo;s rising.</p><p>An oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by God, but that Adamlooked upon her when she was unfolding, and she was ashamed and turnedcrimson. We are of the number who fall speechless in the presence of younggirls and flowers, since we think them worthy of veneration.</p><p>Cosette dressed herself very hastily, combed and dressed her hair, whichwas a very simple matter in those days, when women did not swell out theircurls and bands with cushions and puffs, and did not put crinoline intheir locks. Then she opened the window and cast her eyes around her inevery direction, hoping to descry some bit of the street, an angle of thehouse, an edge of pavement, so that she might be able to watch for Mariusthere. But no view of the outside was to be had. The back court wassurrounded by tolerably high walls, and the outlook was only on severalgardens. Cosette pronounced these gardens hideous: for the first time inher life, she found flowers ugly. The smallest scrap of the gutter of thestreet would have met her wishes better. She decided to gaze at the sky,as though she thought that Marius might come from that quarter.</p><p>All at once, she burst into tears. Not that this was fickleness of soul;but hopes cut in twain by dejection&mdash;that was her case. She had aconfused consciousness of something horrible. Thoughts were rife in theair, in fact. She told herself that she was not sure of anything, that towithdraw herself from sight was to be lost; and the idea that Marius couldreturn to her from heaven appeared to her no longer charming but mournful.</p><p>Then, as is the nature of these clouds, calm returned to her, and hope anda sort of unconscious smile, which yet indicated trust in God.</p><p>Every one in the house was still asleep. A country-like silence reigned.Not a shutter had been opened. The porter&rsquo;s lodge was closed. Toussainthad not risen, and Cosette, naturally, thought that her father was asleep.She must have suffered much, and she must have still been sufferinggreatly, for she said to herself, that her father had been unkind; but shecounted on Marius. The eclipse of such a light was decidedly impossible.Now and then, she heard sharp shocks in the distance, and she said: &ldquo;It isodd that people should be opening and shutting their carriage gates soearly.&rdquo; They were the reports of the cannon battering the barricade.</p><p>A few feet below Cosette&rsquo;s window, in the ancient and perfectly blackcornice of the wall, there was a martin&rsquo;s nest; the curve of this nestformed a little projection beyond the cornice, so that from above it waspossible to look into this little paradise. The mother was there,spreading her wings like a fan over her brood; the father fluttered about,flew away, then came back, bearing in his beak food and kisses. Thedawning day gilded this happy thing, the great law, &ldquo;Multiply,&rdquo; lay theresmiling and august, and that sweet mystery unfolded in the glory of themorning. Cosette, with her hair in the sunlight, her soul absorbed inchimæras, illuminated by love within and by the dawn without, bent overmechanically, and almost without daring to avow to herself that she wasthinking at the same time of Marius, began to gaze at these birds, at thisfamily, at that male and female, that mother and her little ones, with theprofound trouble which a nest produces on a virgin.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0309" id="link2HCH0309"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;THE SHOT WHICH MISSES NOTHING AND KILLS NO ONE</h3><p>The assailants&rsquo; fire continued. Musketry and grape-shot alternated, butwithout committing great ravages, to tell the truth. The top alone of theCorinthe façade suffered; the window on the first floor, and the atticwindow in the roof, riddled with buckshot and biscaïens, were slowlylosing their shape. The combatants who had been posted there had beenobliged to withdraw. However, this is according to the tactics ofbarricades; to fire for a long while, in order to exhaust the insurgents&rsquo;ammunition, if they commit the mistake of replying. When it is perceived,from the slackening of their fire, that they have no more powder and ball,the assault is made. Enjolras had not fallen into this trap; the barricadedid not reply.</p><p>At every discharge by platoons, Gavroche puffed out his cheek with histongue, a sign of supreme disdain.</p><p>&ldquo;Good for you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;rip up the cloth. We want some lint.&rdquo;</p><p>Courfeyrac called the grape-shot to order for the little effect which itproduced, and said to the cannon:</p><p>&ldquo;You are growing diffuse, my good fellow.&rdquo;</p><p>One gets puzzled in battle, as at a ball. It is probable that this silenceon the part of the redoubt began to render the besiegers uneasy, and tomake them fear some unexpected incident, and that they felt the necessityof getting a clear view behind that heap of paving-stones, and of knowingwhat was going on behind that impassable wall which received blows withoutretorting. The insurgents suddenly perceived a helmet glittering in thesun on a neighboring roof. A fireman had placed his back against a tallchimney, and seemed to be acting as sentinel.

Jean Valjean, who had re-loaded his gun,took aim at the newcomer and sent the officer&rsquo;s casque to join thesoldier&rsquo;s. The officer did not persist, and retired speedily. This timethe warning was understood. No one made his appearance thereafter on thatroof; and the idea of spying on the barricade was abandoned.</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you not kill the man?&rdquo; Bossuet asked Jean Valjean.</p><p>Jean Valjean made no reply.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0310" id="link2HCH0310"></a>CHAPTER XII&mdash;DISORDER A PARTISAN OF ORDER</h3><p>Bossuet muttered in Combeferre&rsquo;s ear:</p><p>&ldquo;He did not answer my question.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is a man who does good by gun-shots,&rdquo; said Combeferre.</p><p>Those who have preserved some memory of this already distant epoch knowthat the National Guard from the suburbs was valiant againstinsurrections. It was particularly zealous and intrepid in the days ofJune, 1832. A certain good dram-shop keeper of Pantin des Vertus or laCunette, whose &ldquo;establishment&rdquo; had been closed by the riots, becameleonine at the sight of his deserted dance-hall, and got himself killed topreserve the order represented by a tea-garden. In that bourgeois andheroic time, in the presence of ideas which had their knights, interestshad their paladins. The prosiness of the originators detracted nothingfrom the bravery of the movement. The diminution of a pile of crowns madebankers sing the Marseillaise. They shed their blood lyrically for thecounting-house; and they defended the shop, that immense diminutive of thefatherland, with Lacedæmonian enthusiasm.</p><p>At bottom, we will observe, there was nothing in all this that was notextremely serious. It was social elements entering into strife, whileawaiting the day when they should enter into equilibrium.</p><p>Another sign of the times was the anarchy mingled with governmentalism[the barbarous name of the correct party]. People were for order incombination with lack of discipline.</p><p>The drum suddenly beat capricious calls, at the command of such or such aColonel of the National Guard; such and such a captain went into actionthrough inspiration; such and such National Guardsmen fought, &ldquo;for anidea,&rdquo; and on their own account. At critical moments, on &ldquo;days&rdquo; they tookcounsel less of their leaders than of their instincts. There existed inthe army of order, veritable guerilleros, some of the sword, likeFannicot, others of the pen, like Henri Fonfrède.</p><p>Civilization, unfortunately, represented at this epoch rather by anaggregation of interests than by a group of principles, was or thoughtitself, in peril; it set up the cry of alarm; each, constituting himself acentre, defended it, succored it, and protected it with his own head; andthe first comer took it upon himself to save society.</p><p>Zeal sometimes proceeded to extermination. A platoon of the National Guardwould constitute itself on its own authority a private council of war, andjudge and execute a captured insurgent in five minutes. It was animprovisation of this sort that had slain Jean Prouvaire. Fierce Lynchlaw, with which no one party had any right to reproach the rest, for ithas been applied by the Republic in America, as well as by the monarchy inEurope. This Lynch law was complicated with mistakes. On one day ofrioting, a young poet, named Paul Aimé Garnier, was pursued in the PlaceRoyale, with a bayonet at his loins, and only escaped by taking refugeunder the porte-cochère of No. 6. They shouted:&mdash;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another ofthose Saint-Simonians!&rdquo; and they wanted to kill him. Now, he had under hisarm a volume of the memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon. A National Guardhad read the words <i>Saint-Simon</i> on the book, and had shouted: &ldquo;Death!&rdquo;</p><p>On the 6th of June, 1832, a company of the National Guards from thesuburbs, commanded by the Captain Fannicot, above mentioned, had itselfdecimated in the Rue de la Chanvrerie out of caprice and its own goodpleasure. This fact, singular though it may seem, was proved at thejudicial investigation opened in consequence of the insurrection of 1832.Captain Fannicot, a bold and impatient bourgeois, a sort of condottiere ofthe order of those whom we have just characterized, a fanatical andintractable governmentalist, could not resist the temptation to fireprematurely, and the ambition of capturing the barricade alone andunaided, that is to say, with his company. Exasperated by the successiveapparition of the red flag and the old coat which he took for the blackflag, he loudly blamed the generals and chiefs of the corps, who wereholding council and did not think that the moment for the decisive assaulthad arrived, and who were allowing &ldquo;the insurrection to fry in its ownfat,&rdquo; to use the celebrated expression of one of them. For his part, hethought the barricade ripe, and as that which is ripe ought to fall, hemade the attempt.</p><p>He commanded men as resolute as himself, &ldquo;raging fellows,&rdquo; as a witnesssaid. His company, the same which had shot Jean Prouvaire the poet, wasthe first of the battalion posted at the angle of the street. At themoment when they were least expecting it, the captain launched his menagainst the barricade. This movement, executed with more good will thanstrategy, cost the Fannicot company dear. Before it had traversed twothirds of the street it was received by a general discharge from thebarricade. Four, the most audacious, who were running on in front, weremown down point-blank at the very foot of the redoubt, and this courageousthrong of National Guards, very brave men but lacking in militarytenacity, were forced to fall back, after some hesitation, leaving fifteencorpses on the pavement. This momentary hesitation gave the insurgentstime to re-load their weapons, and a second and very destructive dischargestruck the company before it could regain the corner of the street, itsshelter. A moment more, and it was caught between two fires, and itreceived the volley from the battery piece which, not having received theorder, had not discontinued its firing.</p><p>The intrepid and imprudent Fannicot was one of the dead from thisgrape-shot. He was killed by the cannon, that is to say, by order.</p><p>This attack, which was more furious than serious, irritated Enjolras.&mdash;&ldquo;Thefools!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They are getting their own men killed and they are usingup our ammunition for nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras spoke like the real general of insurrection which he was.Insurrection and repression do not fight with equal weapons. Insurrection,which is speedily exhausted, has only a certain number of shots to fireand a certain number of combatants to expend. An empty cartridge-box, aman killed, cannot be replaced. As repression has the army, it does notcount its men, and, as it has Vincennes, it does not count its shots.Repression has as many regiments as the barricade has men, and as manyarsenals as the barricade has cartridge-boxes. Thus they are struggles ofone against a hundred, which always end in crushing the barricade; unlessthe revolution, uprising suddenly, flings into the balance its flamingarchangel&rsquo;s sword. This does happen sometimes. Then everything rises, thepavements begin to seethe, popular redoubts abound. Paris quiverssupremely, the <i>quid divinum</i> is given forth, a 10th of August is in theair, a 29th of July is in the air, a wonderful light appears, the yawningmaw of force draws back, and the army, that lion, sees before it, erectand tranquil, that prophet, France.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0311" id="link2HCH0311"></a>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;PASSING GLEAMS</h3><p>In the chaos of sentiments and passions which defend a barricade, there isa little of everything; there is bravery, there is youth, honor,enthusiasm, the ideal, conviction, the rage of the gambler, and, aboveall, intermittences of hope.</p><p>One of these intermittences, one of these vague quivers of hope suddenlytraversed the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie at the moment when itwas least expected.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; suddenly cried Enjolras, who was still on the watch, &ldquo;it seemsto me that Paris is waking up.&rdquo;</p><p>It is certain that, on the morning of the 6th of June, the insurrectionbroke out afresh for an hour or two, to a certain extent. The obstinacy ofthe alarm peal of Saint-Merry reanimated some fancies. Barricades werebegun in the Rue du Poirier and the Rue des Gravilliers. In front of thePorte Saint-Martin, a young man, armed with a rifle, attacked alone asquadron of cavalry. In plain sight, on the open boulevard, he placed oneknee on the ground, shouldered his weapon, fired, killed the commander ofthe squadron, and turned away, saying: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another who will do us nomore harm.&rdquo;</p><p>He was put to the sword. In the Rue Saint-Denis, a woman fired on theNational Guard from behind a lowered blind. The slats of the blind couldbe seen to tremble at every shot. A child fourteen years of age wasarrested in the Rue de la Cossonerie, with his pockets full of cartridges.Many posts were attacked. At the entrance to the Rue Bertin-Poirée, a verylively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed a regiment ofcuirrassiers, at whose head marched Marshal General Cavaignac de Barague.In the Rue Planche-Mibray, they threw old pieces of pottery and householdutensils down on the soldiers from the roofs; a bad sign; and when thismatter was reported to Marshal Soult, Napoleon&rsquo;s old lieutenant grewthoughtful, as he recalled Suchet&rsquo;s saying at Saragossa: &ldquo;We are lost whenthe old women empty their pots de chambre on our heads.&rdquo;</p><p>These general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment when itwas thought that the uprising had been rendered local, this fever ofwrath, these sparks which flew hither and thither above those deep massesof combustibles which are called the faubourgs of Paris,&mdash;all this,taken together, disturbed the military chiefs. They made haste to stampout these beginnings of conflagration.</p><p>They delayed the attack on the barricades Maubuée, de la Chanvrerie andSaint-Merry until these sparks had been extinguished, in order that theymight have to deal with the barricades only and be able to finish them atone blow. Columns were thrown into the streets where there wasfermentation, sweeping the large, sounding the small, right and left, nowslowly and cautiously, now at full charge. The troops broke in the doorsof houses whence shots had been fired; at the same time, manœuvres by thecavalry dispersed the groups on the boulevards. This repression was noteffected without some commotion, and without that tumultuous uproarpeculiar to collisions between the army and the people. This was whatEnjolras had caught in the intervals of the cannonade and the musketry.Moreover, he had seen wounded men passing the end of the street inlitters, and he said to Courfeyrac:&mdash;&ldquo;Those wounded do not come fromus.&rdquo;</p><p>Their hope did not last long; the gleam was quickly eclipsed. In less thanhalf an hour, what was in the air vanished, it was a flash of lightningunaccompanied by thunder, and the insurgents felt that sort of leadencope, which the indifference of the people casts over obstinate anddeserted men, fall over them once more.</p><p>The general movement, which seemed to have assumed a vague outline, hadmiscarried; and the attention of the minister of war and the strategy ofthe generals could now be concentrated on the three or four barricadeswhich still remained standing.</p><p>The sun was mounting above the horizon.</p><p>An insurgent hailed Enjolras.</p><p>&ldquo;We are hungry here. Are we really going to die like this, withoutanything to eat?&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras, who was still leaning on his elbows at his embrasure, made anaffirmative sign with his head, but without taking his eyes from the endof the street.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0312" id="link2HCH0312"></a>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;WHEREIN WILL APPEAR THE NAME OF ENJOLRAS&rsquo; MISTRESS</h3><p>Courfeyrac, seated on a paving-stone beside Enjolras, continued to insultthe cannon, and each time that that gloomy cloud of projectiles which iscalled grape-shot passed overhead with its terrible sound he assailed itwith a burst of irony.</p><p>&ldquo;You are wearing out your lungs, poor, brutal, old fellow, you pain me,you are wasting your row.

That is one way of taking our revenge for the capers thatmesdames our grisettes play on us. Roland gets himself killed forAngélique; all our heroism comes from our women. A man without a woman isa pistol without a trigger; it is the woman that sets the man off. Well,Enjolras has no woman. He is not in love, and yet he manages to beintrepid. It is a thing unheard of that a man should be as cold as ice andas bold as fire.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras did not appear to be listening, but had any one been near him,that person would have heard him mutter in a low voice: &ldquo;Patria.&rdquo;</p><p>Bossuet was still laughing when Courfeyrac exclaimed:</p><p>&ldquo;News!&rdquo;</p><p>And assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement, he added:</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Eight-Pounder.&rdquo;</p><p>In fact, a new personage had entered on the scene. This was a second pieceof ordnance.</p><p>The artillery-men rapidly performed their manœuvres in force and placedthis second piece in line with the first.</p><p>This outlined the catastrophe.</p><p>A few minutes later, the two pieces, rapidly served, were firingpoint-blank at the redoubt; the platoon firing of the line and of thesoldiers from the suburbs sustained the artillery.</p><p>Another cannonade was audible at some distance. At the same time that thetwo guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the Rue de laChanvrerie, two other cannons, trained one from the Rue Saint-Denis, theother from the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, were riddling the Saint-Merrybarricade. The four cannons echoed each other mournfully.</p><p>The barking of these sombre dogs of war replied to each other.</p><p>One of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade on the Rue dela Chanvrerie was firing grape-shot, the other balls.</p><p>The piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high, and the aimwas calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper crestof the barricade, and crumbled the stone down upon the insurgents, mingledwith bursts of grape-shot.</p><p>The object of this mode of firing was to drive the insurgents from thesummit of the redoubt, and to compel them to gather close in the interior,that is to say, this announced the assault.</p><p>The combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls, andfrom the windows of the cabaret by grape-shot, the attacking columns couldventure into the street without being picked off, perhaps, even, withoutbeing seen, could briskly and suddenly scale the redoubt, as on thepreceding evening, and, who knows? take it by surprise.</p><p>&ldquo;It is absolutely necessary that the inconvenience of those guns should bediminished,&rdquo; said Enjolras, and he shouted: &ldquo;Fire on the artillery-men!&rdquo;</p><p>All were ready. The barricade, which had long been silent, poured forth adesperate fire; seven or eight discharges followed, with a sort of rageand joy; the street was filled with blinding smoke, and, at the end of afew minutes, athwart this mist all streaked with flame, two thirds of thegunners could be distinguished lying beneath the wheels of the cannons.Those who were left standing continued to serve the pieces with severetranquillity, but the fire had slackened.</p><p>&ldquo;Things are going well now,&rdquo; said Bossuet to Enjolras. &ldquo;Success.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras shook his head and replied:</p><p>&ldquo;Another quarter of an hour of this success, and there will not be anycartridges left in the barricade.&rdquo;</p><p>It appears that Gavroche overheard this remark.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0313" id="link2HCH0313"></a>CHAPTER XV&mdash;GAVROCHE OUTSIDE</h3><p>Courfeyrac suddenly caught sight of some one at the base of the barricade,outside in the street, amid the bullets.</p><p>Gavroche had taken a bottle basket from the wine-shop, had made his wayout through the cut, and was quietly engaged in emptying the fullcartridge-boxes of the National Guardsmen who had been killed on the slopeof the redoubt, into his basket.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; asked Courfeyrac.</p><p>Gavroche raised his face:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m filling my basket, citizen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see the grape-shot?&rdquo;</p><p>Gavroche replied:</p><p>&ldquo;Well, it is raining.

Twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement,through the whole length of the street. Twenty cartouches for Gavrochemeant a provision of cartridges for the barricade.</p><p>The smoke in the street was like a fog. Whoever has beheld a cloud whichhas fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments canimagine this smoke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows of loftyhouses. It rose gradually and was incessantly renewed; hence a twilightwhich made even the broad daylight turn pale. The combatants could hardlysee each other from one end of the street to the other, short as it was.</p><p>This obscurity, which had probably been desired and calculated on by thecommanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade, was useful toGavroche.</p><p>Beneath the folds of this veil of smoke, and thanks to his small size, hecould advance tolerably far into the street without being seen. He rifledthe first seven or eight cartridge-boxes without much danger.</p><p>He crawled flat on his belly, galloped on all fours, took his basket inhis teeth, twisted, glided, undulated, wound from one dead body toanother, and emptied the cartridge-box or cartouche as a monkey opens anut.</p><p>They did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade, which wasquite near, for fear of attracting attention to him.</p><p>On one body, that of a corporal, he found a powder-flask.</p><p>&ldquo;For thirst,&rdquo; said he, putting it in his pocket.</p><p>By dint of advancing, he reached a point where the fog of the fusilladebecame transparent. So that the sharpshooters of the line ranged on theoutlook behind their paving-stone dike and the sharpshooters of thebanlieue massed at the corner of the street suddenly pointed out to eachother something moving through the smoke.</p><p>At the moment when Gavroche was relieving a sergeant, who was lying near astone door-post, of his cartridges, a bullet struck the body.</p><p>&ldquo;Fichtre!&rdquo; ejaculated Gavroche. &ldquo;They are killing my dead men for me.&rdquo;</p><p>A second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him.&mdash;A thirdoverturned his basket.</p><p>Gavroche looked and saw that this came from the men of the banlieue.</p><p>He sprang to his feet, stood erect, with his hair flying in the wind, hishands on his hips, his eyes fixed on the National Guardsmen who werefiring, and sang:</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;On est laid à Nanterre,<br/>C&rsquo;est la faute à Voltaire;<br/>Et bête à Palaiseau,<br/>C&rsquo;est la faute à Rousseau.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Men are ugly at Nanterre,<br/>&rsquo;Tis the fault of Voltaire;<br/>And dull at Palaiseau,<br/>&rsquo;Tis the fault of Rousseau.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he picked up his basket, replaced the cartridges which had fallenfrom it, without missing a single one, and, advancing towards thefusillade, set about plundering another cartridge-box. There a fourthbullet missed him, again. Gavroche sang:</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Je ne suis pas notaire,<br/>C&rsquo;est la faute à Voltaire;<br/>Je suis un petit oiseau,<br/>C&rsquo;est la faute à Rousseau.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;I am not a notary,<br/>&rsquo;Tis the fault of Voltaire;<br/>I&rsquo;m a little bird,<br/>&rsquo;Tis the fault of Rousseau.&rdquo;</p><p>A fifth bullet only succeeded in drawing from him a third couplet.</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Joie est mon caractère,<br/>C&rsquo;est la faute à Voltaire;<br/>Misère est mon trousseau,<br/>C&rsquo;est la faute à Rousseau.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Joy is my character,<br/>&rsquo;Tis the fault of Voltaire;<br/>Misery is my trousseau,<br/>&rsquo;Tis the fault of Rousseau.&rdquo;</p><p>Thus it went on for some time.</p><p>It was a charming and terrible sight. Gavroche, though shot at, wasteasing the fusillade. He had the air of being greatly diverted. It wasthe sparrow pecking at the sportsmen. To each discharge he retorted with acouplet. They aimed at him constantly, and always missed him. The NationalGuardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at him. He lay down,sprang to his feet, hid in the corner of a doorway, then made a bound,disappeared, reappeared, scampered away, returned, replied to thegrape-shot with his thumb at his nose, and, all the while, went onpillaging the cartouches, emptying the cartridge-boxes, and filling hisbasket. The insurgents, panting with anxiety, followed him with theireyes. The barricade trembled; he sang. He was not a child, he was not aman; he was a strange gamin-fairy. He might have been called theinvulnerable dwarf of the fray. The bullets flew after him, he was morenimble than they. He played a fearful game of hide and seek with death;every time that the flat-nosed face of the spectre approached, the urchinadministered to it a fillip.</p><p>One bullet, however, better aimed or more treacherous than the rest,finally struck the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp of a child. Gavroche was seen tostagger, then he sank to the earth. The whole barricade gave vent to acry; but there was something of Antæus in that pygmy; for the gamin totouch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth;Gavroche had fallen only to rise again; he remained in a sitting posture,a long thread of blood streaked his face, he raised both arms in the air,glanced in the direction whence the shot had come, and began to sing:</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Je suis tombé par terre,<br/>C&rsquo;est la faute à Voltaire;<br/>Le nez dans le ruisseau,<br/>C&rsquo;est la faute à . . . &ldquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;I have fallen to the earth,<br/>&rsquo;Tis the fault of Voltaire;<br/>With my nose in the gutter,<br/>&rsquo;Tis the fault of . . . &rdquo;</p><p>He did not finish.

One might have been seven years old, the otherfive. The rain having soaked them, they were walking along the paths onthe sunny side; the elder was leading the younger; they were pale andragged; they had the air of wild birds. The smaller of them said: &ldquo;I amvery hungry.&rdquo;</p><p>The elder, who was already somewhat of a protector, was leading hisbrother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick.</p><p>They were alone in the garden. The garden was deserted, the gates had beenclosed by order of the police, on account of the insurrection. The troopswho had been bivouacking there had departed for the exigencies of combat.</p><p>How did those children come there? Perhaps they had escaped from someguard-house which stood ajar; perhaps there was in the vicinity, at theBarrière d&rsquo;Enfer; or on the Esplanade de l&rsquo;Observatoire, or in theneighboring carrefour, dominated by the pediment on which could be read:<i>Invenerunt parvulum pannis involutum</i>, some mountebank&rsquo;s booth from whichthey had fled; perhaps they had, on the preceding evening, escaped the eyeof the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing, and had passed thenight in some one of those sentry-boxes where people read the papers? Thefact is, they were stray lambs and they seemed free. To be astray and toseem free is to be lost. These poor little creatures were, in fact, lost.</p><p>These two children were the same over whom Gavroche had been put to sometrouble, as the reader will recollect. Children of the Thénardiers, leasedout to Magnon, attributed to M. Gillenormand, and now leaves fallen fromall these rootless branches, and swept over the ground by the wind. Theirclothing, which had been clean in Magnon&rsquo;s day, and which had served heras a prospectus with M. Gillenormand, had been converted into rags.</p><p>Henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as &ldquo;Abandonedchildren,&rdquo; whom the police take note of, collect, mislay and find again onthe pavements of Paris.</p><p>It required the disturbance of a day like that to account for thesemiserable little creatures being in that garden. If the superintendentshad caught sight of them, they would have driven such rags forth. Poorlittle things do not enter public gardens; still, people should reflectthat, as children, they have a right to flowers.</p><p>These children were there, thanks to the locked gates. They were therecontrary to the regulations. They had slipped into the garden and therethey remained. Closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors, oversight issupposed to continue, but it grows slack and reposes; and the inspectors,moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with the outside than theinside, no longer glanced into the garden, and had not seen the twodelinquents.</p><p>It had rained the night before, and even a little in the morning. But inJune, showers do not count for much. An hour after a storm, it can hardlybe seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept. The earth, in summer, isas quickly dried as the cheek of a child. At that period of the solstice,the light of full noonday is, so to speak, poignant. It takes everything.It applies itself to the earth, and superposes itself with a sort ofsuction. One would say that the sun was thirsty. A shower is but a glassof water; a rainstorm is instantly drunk up. In the morning everything wasdripping, in the afternoon everything is powdered over.</p><p>Nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain and wipedby the rays of sunlight; it is warm freshness. The gardens and meadows,having water at their roots, and sun in their flowers, becomeperfuming-pans of incense, and smoke with all their odors at once.Everything smiles, sings and offers itself. One feels gently intoxicated.The springtime is a provisional paradise, the sun helps man to havepatience.</p><p>There are beings who demand nothing further; mortals, who, having theazure of heaven, say: &ldquo;It is enough!&rdquo; dreamers absorbed in the wonderful,dipping into the idolatry of nature, indifferent to good and evil,contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man, who do notunderstand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of these, andthe thirst of those, with the nudity of the poor in winter, with thelymphatic curvature of the little spinal column, with the pallet, theattic, the dungeon, and the rags of shivering young girls, when they candream beneath the trees; peaceful and terrible spirits they, andpitilessly satisfied. Strange to say, the infinite suffices them. Thatgreat need of man, the finite, which admits of embrace, they ignore. Thefinite which admits of progress and sublime toil, they do not think about.The indefinite, which is born from the human and divine combination of theinfinite and the finite, escapes them. Provided that they are face to facewith immensity, they smile. Joy never, ecstasy forever. Their life lies insurrendering their personality in contemplation. The history of humanityis for them only a detailed plan. All is not there; the true All remainswithout; what is the use of busying oneself over that detail, man? Mansuffers, that is quite possible; but look at Aldebaran rising! The motherhas no more milk, the new-born babe is dying. I know nothing about that,but just look at this wonderful rosette which a slice of wood-cells of thepine presents under the microscope! Compare the most beautiful Mechlinlace to that if you can! These thinkers forget to love. The zodiac thriveswith them to such a point that it prevents their seeing the weeping child.God eclipses their souls. This is a family of minds which are, at once,great and petty. Horace was one of them; so was Goethe. La Fontaineperhaps; magnificent egoists of the infinite, tranquil spectators ofsorrow, who do not behold Nero if the weather be fair, for whom the sunconceals the funeral pile, who would look on at an execution by theguillotine in the search for an effect of light, who hear neither the crynor the sob, nor the death rattle, nor the alarm peal, for whom everythingis well, since there is a month of May, who, so long as there are cloudsof purple and gold above their heads, declare themselves content, and whoare determined to be happy until the radiance of the stars and the songsof the birds are exhausted.</p><p>These are dark radiances. They have no suspicion that they are to bepitied. Certainly they are so. He who does not weep does not see. They areto be admired and pitied, as one would both pity and admire a being atonce night and day, without eyes beneath his lashes but with a star on hisbrow.</p><p>The indifference of these thinkers, is, according to some, a superiorphilosophy. That may be; but in this superiority there is some infirmity.One may be immortal and yet limp: witness Vulcan. One may be more than manand less than man. There is incomplete immensity in nature. Who knowswhether the sun is not a blind man?</p><p>But then, what? In whom can we trust? <i>Solem quis dicere falsum audeat?</i> Whoshall dare to say that the sun is false? Thus certain geniuses,themselves, certain Very-Lofty mortals, man-stars, may be mistaken? Thatwhich is on high at the summit, at the crest, at the zenith, that whichsends down so much light on the earth, sees but little, sees badly, seesnot at all? Is not this a desperate state of things? No. But what isthere, then, above the sun? The god.</p><p>On the 6th of June, 1832, about eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning, theLuxembourg, solitary and depopulated, was charming. The quincunxes andflower-beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight. Thebranches, wild with the brilliant glow of midday, seemed endeavoring toembrace. In the sycamores there was an uproar of linnets, sparrowstriumphed, woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees, administeringlittle pecks on the bark. The flower-beds accepted the legitimate royaltyof the lilies; the most august of perfumes is that which emanates fromwhiteness. The peppery odor of the carnations was perceptible. The oldcrows of Marie de Medici were amorous in the tall trees. The sun gilded,empurpled, set fire to and lighted up the tulips, which are nothing butall the varieties of flame made into flowers. All around the banks oftulips the bees, the sparks of these flame-flowers, hummed. All was graceand gayety, even the impending rain; this relapse, by which the lilies ofthe valley and the honeysuckles were destined to profit, had nothingdisturbing about it; the swallows indulged in the charming threat offlying low. He who was there aspired to happiness; life smelled good; allnature exhaled candor, help, assistance, paternity, caress, dawn. Thethoughts which fell from heaven were as sweet as the tiny hand of a babywhen one kisses it.</p><p>The statues under the trees, white and nude, had robes of shadow piercedwith light; these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight; rays hungfrom them on all sides. Around the great fountain, the earth was alreadydried up to the point of being burnt. There was sufficient breeze to raiselittle insurrections of dust here and there. A few yellow leaves, leftover from the autumn, chased each other merrily, and seemed to be playingtricks on each other.</p><p>This abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring about it.Life, sap, heat, odors overflowed; one was conscious, beneath creation, ofthe enormous size of the source; in all these breaths permeated with love,in this interchange of reverberations and reflections, in this marvellousexpenditure of rays, in this infinite outpouring of liquid gold, one feltthe prodigality of the inexhaustible; and, behind this splendor as behinda curtain of flame, one caught a glimpse of God, that millionaire ofstars.</p><p>Thanks to the sand, there was not a speck of mud; thanks to the rain,there was not a grain of ashes. The clumps of blossoms had just beenbathed; every sort of velvet, satin, gold and varnish, which springs fromthe earth in the form of flowers, was irreproachable. This magnificencewas cleanly. The grand silence of happy nature filled the garden. Acelestial silence that is compatible with a thousand sorts of music, thecooing of nests, the buzzing of swarms, the flutterings of the breeze. Allthe harmony of the season was complete in one gracious whole; theentrances and exits of spring took place in proper order; the lilacsended; the jasmines began; some flowers were tardy, some insects inadvance of their time; the van-guard of the red June butterfliesfraternized with the rear-guard of the white butterflies of May. Theplantain trees were getting their new skins. The breeze hollowed outundulations in the magnificent enormity of the chestnut-trees. It wassplendid. A veteran from the neighboring barracks, who was gazing throughthe fence, said: &ldquo;Here is the Spring presenting arms and in full uniform.&rdquo;</p><p>All nature was breakfasting; creation was at table; this was its hour; thegreat blue cloth was spread in the sky, and the great green cloth onearth; the sun lighted it all up brilliantly. God was serving theuniversal repast. Each creature had his pasture or his mess. The ring-dovefound his hemp-seed, the chaffinch found his millet, the goldfinch foundchickweed, the red-breast found worms, the green finch found flies, thefly found infusoriæ, the bee found flowers. They ate each other somewhat,it is true, which is the misery of evil mixed with good; but not a beastof them all had an empty stomach.</p><p>The two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of thegrand fountain, and, rather bewildered by all this light, they tried tohide themselves, the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presence ofeven impersonal magnificence; and they kept behind the swans&rsquo; hutch.</p><p>Here and there, at intervals, when the wind blew, shouts, clamor, a sortof tumultuous death rattle, which was the firing, and dull blows, whichwere discharges of cannon, struck the ear confusedly. Smoke hung over theroofs in the direction of the Halles. A bell, which had the air of anappeal, was ringing in the distance.</p><p>These children did not appear to notice these noises. The little onerepeated from time to time: &ldquo;I am hungry.&rdquo;</p><p>Almost at the same instant with the children, another couple approachedthe great basin. They consisted of a goodman, about fifty years of age,who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six. No doubt, a father andhis son. The little man of six had a big brioche.</p><p>At that epoch, certain houses abutting on the river, in the Rues Madameand d&rsquo;Enfer, had keys to the Luxembourg garden, of which the lodgersenjoyed the use when the gates were shut, a privilege which was suppressedlater on. This father and son came from one of these houses, no doubt.</p><p>The two poor little creatures watched &ldquo;that gentleman&rdquo; approaching, andhid themselves a little more thoroughly.</p><p>He was a bourgeois. The same person, perhaps, whom Marius had one dayheard, through his love fever, near the same grand basin, counselling hisson &ldquo;to avoid excesses.&rdquo; He had an affable and haughty air, and a mouthwhich was always smiling, since it did not shut. This mechanical smile,produced by too much jaw and too little skin, shows the teeth rather thanthe soul. The child, with his brioche, which he had bitten into but hadnot finished eating, seemed satiated. The child was dressed as a NationalGuardsman, owing to the insurrection, and the father had remained clad asa bourgeois out of prudence.</p><p>Father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting.This bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans. Heresembled them in this sense, that he walked like them.</p><p>For the moment, the swans were swimming, which is their principal talent,and they were superb.</p><p>If the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been of an ageto understand, they might have gathered the words of this grave man. Thefather was saying to his son:</p><p>&ldquo;The sage lives content with little. Look at me, my son. I do not lovepomp. I am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones; I leavethat false splendor to badly organized souls.&rdquo;</p><p>Here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the Hallesburst out with fresh force of bell and uproar.</p><p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; inquired the child.</p><p>The father replied:</p><p>&ldquo;It is the Saturnalia.&rdquo;</p><p>All at once, he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind thegreen swan-hutch.</p><p>&ldquo;There is the beginning,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>And, after a pause, he added:</p><p>&ldquo;Anarchy is entering this garden.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meanwhile, his son took a bite of his brioche, spit it out, and,suddenly burst out crying.</p><p>&ldquo;What are you crying about?&rdquo; demanded his father.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not hungry any more,&rdquo; said the child.</p><p>The father&rsquo;s smile became more accentuated.</p><p>&ldquo;One does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My cake tires me. It is stale.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want any more of it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>The father pointed to the swans.</p><p>&ldquo;Throw it to those palmipeds.&rdquo;</p><p>The child hesitated. A person may not want any more of his cake; but thatis no reason for giving it away.</p><p>The father went on:</p><p>&ldquo;Be humane. You must have compassion on animals.&rdquo;</p><p>And, taking the cake from his son, he flung it into the basin.</p><p>The cake fell very near the edge.</p><p>The swans were far away, in the centre of the basin, and busy with someprey. They had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche.</p><p>The bourgeois, feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted, andmoved by this useless shipwreck, entered upon a telegraphic agitation,which finally attracted the attention of the swans.</p><p>They perceived something floating, steered for the edge like ships, asthey are, and slowly directed their course toward the brioche, with thestupid majesty which befits white creatures.</p><p>&ldquo;The swans [<i>cygnes</i>] understand signs [<i>signes</i>],&rdquo; said the bourgeois,delighted to make a jest.</p><p>At that moment, the distant tumult of the city underwent another suddenincrease. This time it was sinister. There are some gusts of wind whichspeak more distinctly than others. The one which was blowing at thatmoment brought clearly defined drum-beats, clamors, platoon firing, andthe dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon. This coincided with ablack cloud which suddenly veiled the sun.</p><p>The swans had not yet reached the brioche.</p><p>&ldquo;Let us return home,&rdquo; said the father, &ldquo;they are attacking the Tuileries.&rdquo;</p><p>He grasped his son&rsquo;s hand again. Then he continued:</p><p>&ldquo;From the Tuileries to the Luxembourg, there is but the distance whichseparates Royalty from the peerage; that is not far. Shots will soon raindown.&rdquo;</p><p>He glanced at the cloud.</p><p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down; the sky isjoining in; the younger branch is condemned. Let us return home quickly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should like to see the swans eat the brioche,&rdquo; said the child.</p><p>The father replied:</p><p>&ldquo;That would be imprudent.&rdquo;</p><p>And he led his little bourgeois away.</p><p>The son, regretting the swans, turned his head back toward the basin untila corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him.</p><p>In the meanwhile, the two little waifs had approached the brioche at thesame time as the swans. It was floating on the water. The smaller of themstared at the cake, the elder gazed after the retreating bourgeois.</p><p>Father and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grandflight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the Rue Madame.</p><p>As soon as they had disappeared from view, the elder child hastily flunghimself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin, andclinging to it with his left hand, and leaning over the water, on theverge of falling in, he stretched out his right hand with his sticktowards the cake. The swans, perceiving the enemy, made haste, and in sodoing, they produced an effect of their breasts which was of service tothe little fisher; the water flowed back before the swans, and one ofthese gentle concentric undulations softly floated the brioche towards thechild&rsquo;s wand. Just as the swans came up, the stick touched the cake. Thechild gave it a brisk rap, drew in the brioche, frightened away the swans,seized the cake, and sprang to his feet. The cake was wet; but they werehungry and thirsty. The elder broke the cake into two portions, a largeone and a small one, took the small one for himself, gave the large one tohis brother, and said to him:</p><p>&ldquo;Ram that into your muzzle.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0315" id="link2HCH0315"></a>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;MORTUUS PATER FILIUM MORITURUM EXPECTAT</h3><p>Marius dashed out of the barricade, Combeferre followed him. But he wastoo late. Gavroche was dead. Combeferre brought back the basket ofcartridges; Marius bore the child.</p><p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;that which the father had done for his father, he wasrequiting to the son; only, Thénardier had brought back his father alive;he was bringing back the child dead.&rdquo;</p><p>When Marius re-entered the redoubt with Gavroche in his arms, his face,like the child, was inundated with blood.</p><p>At the moment when he had stooped to lift Gavroche, a bullet had grazedhis head; he had not noticed it.</p><p>Courfeyrac untied his cravat and with it bandaged Marius&rsquo; brow.</p><p>They laid Gavroche on the same table with Mabeuf, and spread over the twocorpses the black shawl. There was enough of it for both the old man andthe child.</p><p>Combeferre distributed the cartridges from the basket which he had broughtin.</p><p>This gave each man fifteen rounds to fire.</p><p>Jean Valjean was still in the same place, motionless on his stone post.When Combeferre offered him his fifteen cartridges, he shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a rare eccentric,&rdquo; said Combeferre in a low voice to Enjolras. &ldquo;Hefinds a way of not fighting in this barricade.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which does not prevent him from defending it,&rdquo; responded Enjolras.</p><p>&ldquo;Heroism has its originals,&rdquo; resumed Combeferre.</p><p>And Courfeyrac, who had overheard, added:</p><p>&ldquo;He is another sort from Father Mabeuf.&rdquo;</p><p>One thing which must be noted is, that the fire which was battering thebarricade hardly disturbed the interior. Those who have never traversedthe whirlwind of this sort of war can form no idea of the singular momentsof tranquillity mingled with these convulsions. Men go and come, theytalk, they jest, they lounge. Some one whom we know heard a combatant sayto him in the midst of the grape-shot: &ldquo;We are here as at a bachelorbreakfast.&rdquo; The redoubt of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, we repeat, seemedvery calm within. All mutations and all phases had been, or were about tobe, exhausted. The position, from critical, had become menacing, and, frommenacing, was probably about to become desperate. In proportion as thesituation grew gloomy, the glow of heroism empurpled the barricade moreand more. Enjolras, who was grave, dominated it, in the attitude of ayoung Spartan sacrificing his naked sword to the sombre genius, Epidotas.</p><p>Combeferre, wearing an apron, was dressing the wounds: Bossuet and Feuillywere making cartridges with the powder-flask picked up by Gavroche on thedead corporal, and Bossuet said to Feuilly: &ldquo;We are soon to take thediligence for another planet&rdquo;; Courfeyrac was disposing and arranging onsome paving-stones which he had reserved for himself near Enjolras, acomplete arsenal, his sword-cane, his gun, two holster pistols, and acudgel, with the care of a young girl setting a small dunkerque in order.Jean Valjean stared silently at the wall opposite him. An artisan wasfastening Mother Hucheloup&rsquo;s big straw hat on his head with a string, &ldquo;forfear of sun-stroke,&rdquo; as he said. The young men from the Cougourde d&rsquo;Aixwere chatting merrily among themselves, as though eager to speak patoisfor the last time. Joly, who had taken Widow Hucheloup&rsquo;s mirror from thewall, was examining his tongue in it. Some combatants, having discovered afew crusts of rather mouldy bread, in a drawer, were eagerly devouringthem. Marius was disturbed with regard to what his father was about to sayto him.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0316" id="link2HCH0316"></a>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;THE VULTURE BECOME PREY</h3><p>We must insist upon one psychological fact peculiar to barricades. Nothingwhich is characteristic of that surprising war of the streets should beomitted.</p><p>Whatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we have justmentioned, the barricade, for those who are inside it, remains,nonetheless, a vision.</p><p>There is something of the apocalypse in civil war, all the mists of theunknown are commingled with fierce flashes, revolutions are sphinxes, andany one who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed adream.</p><p>The feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed outin the case of Marius, and we shall see the consequences; they are bothmore and less than life. On emerging from a barricade, one no longer knowswhat one has seen there. One has been terrible, but one knows it not. Onehas been surrounded with conflicting ideas which had human faces; one&rsquo;shead has been in the light of the future. There were corpses lying pronethere, and phantoms standing erect. The hours were colossal and seemedhours of eternity. One has lived in death. Shadows have passed by. Whatwere they?</p><p>One has beheld hands on which there was blood; there was a deafeninghorror; there was also a frightful silence; there were open mouths whichshouted, and other open mouths which held their peace; one was in themidst of smoke, of night, perhaps. One fancied that one had touched thesinister ooze of unknown depths; one stares at something red on one&rsquo;sfinger nails. One no longer remembers anything.</p><p>Let us return to the Rue de la Chanvrerie.</p><p>All at once, between two discharges, the distant sound of a clock strikingthe hour became audible.</p><p>&ldquo;It is midday,&rdquo; said Combeferre.</p><p>The twelve strokes had not finished striking when Enjolras sprang to hisfeet, and from the summit of the barricade hurled this thundering shout:</p><p>&ldquo;Carry stones up into the houses; line the windowsills and the roofs withthem. Half the men to their guns, the other half to the paving-stones.There is not a minute to be lost.&rdquo;</p><p>A squad of sappers and miners, axe on shoulder, had just made theirappearance in battle array at the end of the street.</p><p>This could only be the head of a column; and of what column? The attackingcolumn, evidently; the sappers charged with the demolition of thebarricade must always precede the soldiers who are to scale it.</p><p>They were, evidently, on the brink of that moment which M.Clermont-Tonnerre, in 1822, called &ldquo;the tug of war.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras&rsquo; order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiar toships and barricades, the only two scenes of combat where escape isimpossible. In less than a minute, two thirds of the stones which Enjolrashad had piled up at the door of Corinthe had been carried up to the firstfloor and the attic, and before a second minute had elapsed, these stones,artistically set one upon the other, walled up the sash-window on thefirst floor and the windows in the roof to half their height. A fewloop-holes carefully planned by Feuilly, the principal architect, allowedof the passage of the gun-barrels. This armament of the windows could beeffected all the more easily since the firing of grape-shot had ceased.The two cannons were now discharging ball against the centre of thebarrier in order to make a hole there, and, if possible, a breach for theassault.</p><p>When the stones destined to the final defence were in place, Enjolras hadthe bottles which he had set under the table where Mabeuf lay, carried tothe first floor.</p><p>&ldquo;Who is to drink that?&rdquo; Bossuet asked him.</p><p>&ldquo;They,&rdquo; replied Enjolras.</p><p>Then they barricaded the window below, and held in readiness the ironcross-bars which served to secure the door of the wine-shop at night.</p><p>The fortress was complete. The barricade was the rampart, the wine-shopwas the dungeon. With the stones which remained they stopped up theoutlet.</p><p>As the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing of theirammunition, and as the assailants know this, the assailants combine theirarrangements with a sort of irritating leisure, expose themselves to fireprematurely, though in appearance more than in reality, and take theirease. The preparations for attack are always made with a certainmethodical deliberation; after which, the lightning strikes.</p><p>This deliberation permitted Enjolras to take a review of everything and toperfect everything. He felt that, since such men were to die, their deathought to be a masterpiece.</p><p>He said to Marius: &ldquo;We are the two leaders. I will give the last ordersinside. Do you remain outside and observe.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the barricade.</p><p>Enjolras had the door of the kitchen, which was the ambulance, as thereader will remember, nailed up.</p><p>&ldquo;No splashing of the wounded,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>He issued his final orders in the tap-room in a curt, but profoundlytranquil tone; Feuilly listened and replied in the name of all.</p><p>&ldquo;On the first floor, hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase.Have you them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Feuilly.</p><p>&ldquo;How many?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Two axes and a pole-axe.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is good. There are now twenty-six combatants of us on foot. How manyguns are there?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thirty-four.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eight too many. Keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at hand.Swords and pistols in your belts. Twenty men to the barricade. Sixambushed in the attic windows, and at the window on the first floor tofire on the assailants through the loop-holes in the stones. Let not asingle worker remain inactive here. Presently, when the drum beats theassault, let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade. The first toarrive will have the best places.&rdquo;</p><p>These arrangements made, he turned to Javert and said:</p><p>&ldquo;I am not forgetting you.&rdquo;</p><p>And, laying a pistol on the table, he added:</p><p>&ldquo;The last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; inquired a voice.</p><p>&ldquo;No, let us not mix their corpses with our own. The little barricade ofthe Mondétour lane can be scaled. It is only four feet high. The man iswell pinioned. He shall be taken thither and put to death.&rdquo;</p><p>There was some one who was more impassive at that moment than Enjolras, itwas Javert. Here Jean Valjean made his appearance.</p><p>He had been lost among the group of insurgents. He stepped forth and saidto Enjolras:</p><p>&ldquo;You are the commander?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You thanked me a while ago.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the name of the Republic. The barricade has two saviors, MariusPontmercy and yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you think that I deserve a recompense?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I request one.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I may blow that man&rsquo;s brains out.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert raised his head, saw Jean Valjean, made an almost imperceptiblemovement, and said:</p><p>&ldquo;That is just.&rdquo;</p><p>As for Enjolras, he had begun to re-load his rifle; he cut his eyes abouthim:</p><p>&ldquo;No objections.&rdquo;</p><p>And he turned to Jean Valjean:</p><p>&ldquo;Take the spy.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean did, in fact, take possession of Javert, by seating himselfon the end of the table. He seized the pistol, and a faint click announcedthat he had cocked it.</p><p>Almost at the same moment, a blast of trumpets became audible.</p><p>&ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; shouted Marius from the top of the barricade.</p><p>Javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar to him,and gazing intently at the insurgents, he said to them:</p><p>&ldquo;You are in no better case than I am.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All out!&rdquo; shouted Enjolras.</p><p>The insurgents poured out tumultuously, and, as they went, received in theback,&mdash;may we be permitted the expression,&mdash;this sally ofJavert&rsquo;s:</p><p>&ldquo;We shall meet again shortly!&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0317" id="link2HCH0317"></a>CHAPTER XIX&mdash;JEAN VALJEAN TAKES HIS REVENGE</h3><p>When Jean Valjean was left alone with Javert, he untied the rope whichfastened the prisoner across the middle of the body, and the knot of whichwas under the table. After this he made him a sign to rise.</p><p>Javert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy ofenchained authority is condensed.</p><p>Jean Valjean took Javert by the martingale, as one would take a beast ofburden by the breast-band, and, dragging the latter after him, emergedfrom the wine-shop slowly, because Javert, with his impeded limbs, couldtake only very short steps.</p><p>Jean Valjean had the pistol in his hand.</p><p>In this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade. Theinsurgents, all intent on the attack, which was imminent, had their backsturned to these two.</p><p>Marius alone, stationed on one side, at the extreme left of the barricade,saw them pass. This group of victim and executioner was illuminated by thesepulchral light which he bore in his own soul.</p><p>Jean Valjean with some difficulty, but without relaxing his hold for asingle instant, made Javert, pinioned as he was, scale the littleentrenchment in the Mondétour lane.</p><p>When they had crossed this barrier, they found themselves alone in thelane. No one saw them. Among the heap they could distinguish a livid face,streaming hair, a pierced hand and the half nude breast of a woman. It wasÉponine. The corner of the houses hid them from the insurgents. Thecorpses carried away from the barricade formed a terrible pile a few pacesdistant.</p><p>Javert gazed askance at this body, and, profoundly calm, said in a lowtone:</p><p>&ldquo;It strikes me that I know that girl.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he turned to Jean Valjean.</p><p>Jean Valjean thrust the pistol under his arm and fixed on Javert a lookwhich it required no words to interpret: &ldquo;Javert, it is I.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert replied:</p><p>&ldquo;Take your revenge.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean drew from his pocket a knife, and opened it.</p><p>&ldquo;A clasp-knife!&rdquo; exclaimed Javert, &ldquo;you are right. That suits you better.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean cut the martingale which Javert had about his neck, then hecut the cords on his wrists, then, stooping down, he cut the cord on hisfeet; and, straightening himself up, he said to him:</p><p>&ldquo;You are free.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert was not easily astonished. Still, master of himself though he was,he could not repress a start. He remained open-mouthed and motionless.</p><p>Jean Valjean continued:</p><p>&ldquo;I do not think that I shall escape from this place. But if, by chance, Ido, I live, under the name of Fauchelevent, in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé,No. 7.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert snarled like a tiger, which made him half open one corner of hismouth, and he muttered between his teeth:</p><p>&ldquo;Have a care.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>Javert began again:</p><p>&ldquo;Thou saidst Fauchelevent, Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Number 7.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert repeated in a low voice:&mdash;&ldquo;Number 7.&rdquo;</p><p>He buttoned up his coat once more, resumed the military stiffness betweenhis shoulders, made a half turn, folded his arms and, supporting his chinon one of his hands, he set out in the direction of the Halles. JeanValjean followed him with his eyes:</p><p>A few minutes later, Javert turned round and shouted to Jean Valjean:</p><p>&ldquo;You annoy me. Kill me, rather.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert himself did not notice that he no longer addressed Jean Valjean as&ldquo;thou.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be off with you,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>Javert retreated slowly. A moment later he turned the corner of the Ruedes Prêcheurs.</p><p>When Javert had disappeared, Jean Valjean fired his pistol in the air.</p><p>Then he returned to the barricade and said:</p><p>&ldquo;It is done.&rdquo;</p><p>In the meanwhile, this is what had taken place.</p><p>Marius, more intent on the outside than on the interior, had not, up tothat time, taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark background ofthe tap-room.</p><p>When he beheld him in broad daylight, striding over the barricade in orderto proceed to his death, he recognized him. Something suddenly recurred tohis mind. He recalled the inspector of the Rue de Pontoise, and the twopistols which the latter had handed to him and which he, Marius, had usedin this very barricade, and not only did he recall his face, but his nameas well.</p><p>This recollection was misty and troubled, however, like all his ideas.</p><p>It was not an affirmation that he made, but a question which he put tohimself:</p><p>&ldquo;Is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name wasJavert?&rdquo;</p><p>Perhaps there was still time to intervene in behalf of that man. But, inthe first place, he must know whether this was Javert.</p><p>Marius called to Enjolras, who had just stationed himself at the otherextremity of the barricade:</p><p>&ldquo;Enjolras!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is the name of yonder man?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What man?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The police agent.

When the situation was not ripe, when the insurrectionwas not decidedly admitted, when the masses disowned the movement, all wasover with the combatants, the city was changed into a desert around therevolt, souls grew chilled, refuges were nailed up, and the street turnedinto a defile to help the army to take the barricade.</p><p>A people cannot be forced, through surprise, to walk more quickly than itchooses. Woe to whomsoever tries to force its hand! A people does not letitself go at random. Then it abandons the insurrection to itself. Theinsurgents become noxious, infected with the plague. A house is anescarpment, a door is a refusal, a façade is a wall. This wall hears, seesand will not. It might open and save you. No. This wall is a judge. Itgazes at you and condemns you. What dismal things are closed houses. Theyseem dead, they are living. Life which is, as it were, suspended there,persists there. No one has gone out of them for four and twenty hours, butno one is missing from them. In the interior of that rock, people go andcome, go to bed and rise again; they are a family party there; there theyeat and drink; they are afraid, a terrible thing! Fear excuses thisfearful lack of hospitality; terror is mixed with it, an extenuatingcircumstance. Sometimes, even, and this has been actually seen, fear turnsto passion; fright may change into fury, as prudence does into rage; hencethis wise saying: &ldquo;The enraged moderates.&rdquo; There are outbursts of supremeterror, whence springs wrath like a mournful smoke.&mdash;&ldquo;What do thesepeople want? What have they come there to do? Let them get out of thescrape. So much the worse for them. It is their fault. They are onlygetting what they deserve. It does not concern us. Here is our poor streetall riddled with balls. They are a pack of rascals. Above all things,don&rsquo;t open the door.&rdquo;&mdash;And the house assumes the air of a tomb. Theinsurgent is in the death-throes in front of that house; he sees thegrape-shot and naked swords drawing near; if he cries, he knows that theyare listening to him, and that no one will come; there stand walls whichmight protect him, there are men who might save him; and these walls haveears of flesh, and these men have bowels of stone.</p><p>Whom shall he reproach?</p><p>No one and every one.</p><p>The incomplete times in which we live.</p><p>It is always at its own risk and peril that Utopia is converted intorevolution, and from philosophical protest becomes an armed protest, andfrom Minerva turns to Pallas.</p><p>The Utopia which grows impatient and becomes revolt knows what awaits it;it almost always comes too soon. Then it becomes resigned, and stoicallyaccepts catastrophe in lieu of triumph. It serves those who deny itwithout complaint, even excusing them, and even disculpates them, and itsmagnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment. It is indomitable inthe face of obstacles and gentle towards ingratitude.</p><p>Is this ingratitude, however?</p><p>Yes, from the point of view of the human race.</p><p>No, from the point of view of the individual.</p><p>Progress is man&rsquo;s mode of existence. The general life of the human race iscalled Progress, the collective stride of the human race is calledProgress. Progress advances; it makes the great human and terrestrialjourney towards the celestial and the divine; it has its halting placeswhere it rallies the laggard troop, it has its stations where itmeditates, in the presence of some splendid Canaan suddenly unveiled onits horizon, it has its nights when it sleeps; and it is one of thepoignant anxieties of the thinker that he sees the shadow resting on thehuman soul, and that he gropes in darkness without being able to awakenthat slumbering Progress.</p><p>&ldquo;God is dead, perhaps,&rdquo; said Gerard de Nerval one day to the writer ofthese lines, confounding progress with God, and taking the interruption ofmovement for the death of Being.</p><p>He who despairs is in the wrong. Progress infallibly awakes, and, inshort, we may say that it marches on, even when it is asleep, for it hasincreased in size. When we behold it erect once more, we find it taller.To be always peaceful does not depend on progress any more than it does onthe stream; erect no barriers, cast in no boulders; obstacles make waterfroth and humanity boil. Hence arise troubles; but after these troubles,we recognize the fact that ground has been gained. Until order, which isnothing else than universal peace, has been established, until harmony andunity reign, progress will have revolutions as its halting-places.</p><p>What, then, is progress? We have just enunciated it; the permanent life ofthe peoples.</p><p>Now, it sometimes happens, that the momentary life of individuals offersresistance to the eternal life of the human race.</p><p>Let us admit without bitterness, that the individual has his distinctinterests, and can, without forfeiture, stipulate for his interest, anddefend it; the present has its pardonable dose of egotism; momentary lifehas its rights, and is not bound to sacrifice itself constantly to thefuture. The generation which is passing in its turn over the earth, is notforced to abridge it for the sake of the generations, its equal, afterall, who will have their turn later on.&mdash;&ldquo;I exist,&rdquo; murmurs that someone whose name is All. &ldquo;I am young and in love, I am old and I wish torepose, I am the father of a family, I toil, I prosper, I am successful inbusiness, I have houses to lease, I have money in the government funds, Iam happy, I have a wife and children, I have all this, I desire to live,leave me in peace.&rdquo;&mdash;Hence, at certain hours, a profound cold broodsover the magnanimous vanguard of the human race.</p><p>Utopia, moreover, we must admit, quits its radiant sphere when it makeswar. It, the truth of to-morrow, borrows its mode of procedure, battle,from the lie of yesterday. It, the future, behaves like the past. It, pureidea, becomes a deed of violence. It complicates its heroism with aviolence for which it is just that it should be held to answer; a violenceof occasion and expedient, contrary to principle, and for which it isfatally punished. The Utopia, insurrection, fights with the old militarycode in its fist; it shoots spies, it executes traitors; it suppressesliving beings and flings them into unknown darkness. It makes use ofdeath, a serious matter. It seems as though Utopia had no longer any faithin radiance, its irresistible and incorruptible force. It strikes with thesword. Now, no sword is simple. Every blade has two edges; he who woundswith the one is wounded with the other.</p><p>Having made this reservation, and made it with all severity, it isimpossible for us not to admire, whether they succeed or not, those theglorious combatants of the future, the confessors of Utopia. Even whenthey miscarry, they are worthy of veneration; and it is, perhaps, infailure, that they possess the most majesty. Victory, when it is in accordwith progress, merits the applause of the people; but a heroic defeatmerits their tender compassion. The one is magnificent, the other sublime.For our own part, we prefer martyrdom to success. John Brown is greaterthan Washington, and Pisacane is greater than Garibaldi.</p><p>It certainly is necessary that some one should take the part of thevanquished.</p><p>We are unjust towards these great men who attempt the future, when theyfail.</p><p>Revolutionists are accused of sowing fear abroad. Every barricade seems acrime. Their theories are incriminated, their aim suspected, theirulterior motive is feared, their conscience denounced. They are reproachedwith raising, erecting, and heaping up, against the reigning social state,a mass of miseries, of griefs, of iniquities, of wrongs, of despairs, andof tearing from the lowest depths blocks of shadow in order therein toembattle themselves and to combat. People shout to them: &ldquo;You are tearingup the pavements of hell!&rdquo; They might reply: &ldquo;That is because ourbarricade is made of good intentions.&rdquo;</p><p>The best thing, assuredly, is the pacific solution. In short, let us agreethat when we behold the pavement, we think of the bear, and it is a goodwill which renders society uneasy. But it depends on society to saveitself, it is to its own good will that we make our appeal. No violentremedy is necessary. To study evil amiably, to prove its existence, thento cure it. It is to this that we invite it.</p><p>However that may be, even when fallen, above all when fallen, these men,who at every point of the universe, with their eyes fixed on France, arestriving for the grand work with the inflexible logic of the ideal, areaugust; they give their life a free offering to progress; they accomplishthe will of Providence; they perform a religious act. At the appointedhour, with as much disinterestedness as an actor who answers to his cue,in obedience to the divine stage-manager, they enter the tomb. And thishopeless combat, this stoical disappearance they accept in order to bringabout the supreme and universal consequences, the magnificent andirresistibly human movement begun on the 14th of July, 1789; thesesoldiers are priests. The French revolution is an act of God.</p><p>Moreover, there are, and it is proper to add this distinction to thedistinctions already pointed out in another chapter,&mdash;there areaccepted revolutions, revolutions which are called revolutions; there arerefused revolutions, which are called riots.</p><p>An insurrection which breaks out, is an idea which is passing itsexamination before the people. If the people lets fall a black ball, theidea is dried fruit; the insurrection is a mere skirmish.</p><p>Waging war at every summons and every time that Utopia desires it, is notthe thing for the peoples. Nations have not always and at every hour thetemperament of heroes and martyrs.</p><p>They are positive. <i>A priori</i>, insurrection is repugnant to them, in thefirst place, because it often results in a catastrophe, in the secondplace, because it always has an abstraction as its point of departure.</p><p>Because, and this is a noble thing, it is always for the ideal, and forthe ideal alone, that those who sacrifice themselves do thus sacrificethemselves. An insurrection is an enthusiasm. Enthusiasm may wax wroth;hence the appeal to arms. But every insurrection, which aims at agovernment or a régime, aims higher. Thus, for instance, and we insistupon it, what the chiefs of the insurrection of 1832, and, in particular,the young enthusiasts of the Rue de la Chanvrerie were combating, was notprecisely Louis Philippe. The majority of them, when talking freely, didjustice to this king who stood midway between monarchy and revolution; noone hated him. But they attacked the younger branch of the divine right inLouis Philippe as they had attacked its elder branch in Charles X.; andthat which they wished to overturn in overturning royalty in France, was,as we have explained, the usurpation of man over man, and of privilegeover right in the entire universe. Paris without a king has as result theworld without despots. This is the manner in which they reasoned. Theiraim was distant no doubt, vague perhaps, and it retreated in the face oftheir efforts; but it was great.</p><p>Thus it is. And we sacrifice ourselves for these visions, which are almostalways illusions for the sacrificed, but illusions with which, after all,the whole of human certainty is mingled. We throw ourselves into thesetragic affairs and become intoxicated with that which we are about to do.Who knows? We may succeed. We are few in number, we have a whole armyarrayed against us; but we are defending right, the natural law, thesovereignty of each one over himself from which no abdication is possible,justice and truth, and in case of need, we die like the three hundredSpartans. We do not think of Don Quixote but of Leonidas. And we marchstraight before us, and once pledged, we do not draw back, and we rushonwards with head held low, cherishing as our hope an unprecedentedvictory, revolution completed, progress set free again, the aggrandizementof the human race, universal deliverance; and in the event of the worst,Thermopylæ.</p><p>These passages of arms for the sake of progress often suffer shipwreck,and we have just explained why. The crowd is restive in the presence ofthe impulses of paladins. Heavy masses, the multitudes which are fragilebecause of their very weight, fear adventures; and there is a touch ofadventure in the ideal.</p><p>Moreover, and we must not forget this, interests which are not veryfriendly to the ideal and the sentimental are in the way. Sometimes thestomach paralyzes the heart.</p><p>The grandeur and beauty of France lies in this, that she takes less fromthe stomach than other nations: she more easily knots the rope about herloins. She is the first awake, the last asleep. She marches forwards. Sheis a seeker.</p><p>This arises from the fact that she is an artist.</p><p>The ideal is nothing but the culminating point of logic, the same as thebeautiful is nothing but the summit of the true. Artistic peoples are alsoconsistent peoples. To love beauty is to see the light. That is why thetorch of Europe, that is to say of civilization, was first borne byGreece, who passed it on to Italy, who handed it on to France. Divine,illuminating nations of scouts! <i>Vitælampada tradunt</i>.</p><p>It is an admirable thing that the poetry of a people is the element of itsprogress. The amount of civilization is measured by the quantity ofimagination. Only, a civilizing people should remain a manly people.Corinth, yes; Sybaris, no. Whoever becomes effeminate makes himself abastard. He must be neither a dilettante nor a virtuoso: but he must beartistic. In the matter of civilization, he must not refine, but he mustsublime. On this condition, one gives to the human race the pattern of theideal.</p><p>The modern ideal has its type in art, and its means is science. It isthrough science that it will realize that august vision of the poets, thesocially beautiful. Eden will be reconstructed by A+B. At the point whichcivilization has now reached, the exact is a necessary element of thesplendid, and the artistic sentiment is not only served, but completed bythe scientific organ; dreams must be calculated. Art, which is theconqueror, should have for support science, which is the walker; thesolidity of the creature which is ridden is of importance. The modernspirit is the genius of Greece with the genius of India as its vehicle;Alexander on the elephant.</p><p>Races which are petrified in dogma or demoralized by lucre are unfit toguide civilization. Genuflection before the idol or before money wastesaway the muscles which walk and the will which advances. Hieratic ormercantile absorption lessens a people&rsquo;s power of radiance, lowers itshorizon by lowering its level, and deprives it of that intelligence, atonce both human and divine of the universal goal, which makes missionariesof nations. Babylon has no ideal; Carthage has no ideal. Athens and Romehave and keep, throughout all the nocturnal darkness of the centuries,halos of civilization.</p><p>France is in the same quality of race as Greece and Italy. She is Athenianin the matter of beauty, and Roman in her greatness. Moreover, she isgood. She gives herself. Oftener than is the case with other races, is shein the humor for self-devotion and sacrifice. Only, this humor seizes uponher, and again abandons her. And therein lies the great peril for thosewho run when she desires only to walk, or who walk on when she desires tohalt. France has her relapses into materialism, and, at certain instants,the ideas which obstruct that sublime brain have no longer anything whichrecalls French greatness and are of the dimensions of a Missouri or aSouth Carolina. What is to be done in such a case? The giantess plays atbeing a dwarf; immense France has her freaks of pettiness. That is all.</p><p>To this there is nothing to say. Peoples, like planets, possess the rightto an eclipse. And all is well, provided that the light returns and thatthe eclipse does not degenerate into night. Dawn and resurrection aresynonymous. The reappearance of the light is identical with thepersistence of the <i>I</i>.</p><p>Let us state these facts calmly. Death on the barricade or the tomb inexile, is an acceptable occasion for devotion. The real name of devotionis disinterestedness. Let the abandoned allow themselves to be abandoned,let the exiled allow themselves to be exiled, and let us confine ourselvesto entreating great nations not to retreat too far, when they do retreat.One must not push too far in descent under pretext of a return to reason.</p><p>Matter exists, the minute exists, interest exists, the stomach exists; butthe stomach must not be the sole wisdom. The life of the moment has itsrights, we admit, but permanent life has its rights also. Alas! the factthat one is mounted does not preclude a fall. This can be seen in historymore frequently than is desirable: A nation is great, it tastes the ideal,then it bites the mire, and finds it good; and if it be asked how ithappens that it has abandoned Socrates for Falstaff, it replies: &ldquo;BecauseI love statesmen.&rdquo;</p><p>One word more before returning to our subject, the conflict.</p><p>A battle like the one which we are engaged in describing is nothing elsethan a convulsion towards the ideal. Progress trammelled is sickly, and issubject to these tragic epilepsies. With that malady of progress, civilwar, we have been obliged to come in contact in our passage. This is oneof the fatal phases, at once act and entr&rsquo;acte of that drama whose pivotis a social condemnation, and whose veritable title is <i>Progress</i>.</p><p>Progress!</p><p>The cry to which we frequently give utterance is our whole thought; and,at the point of this drama which we have now reached, the idea which itcontains having still more than one trial to undergo, it is, perhaps,permitted to us, if not to lift the veil from it, to at least allow itslight to shine through.</p><p>The book which the reader has under his eye at this moment is, from oneend to the other, as a whole and in detail, whatever may be itsintermittences, exceptions and faults, the march from evil to good, fromthe unjust to the just, from night to day, from appetite to conscience,from rottenness to life, from hell to heaven, from nothingness to God.Point of departure: matter; point of arrival: the soul.

On the evening before, in the darkness, thebarricade had been approached silently, as by a boa. Now, in broaddaylight, in that widening street, surprise was decidedly impossible, rudeforce had, moreover, been unmasked, the cannon had begun the roar, thearmy hurled itself on the barricade. Fury now became skill. A powerfuldetachment of infantry of the line, broken at regular intervals, by theNational Guard and the Municipal Guard on foot, and supported by serriedmasses which could be heard though not seen, debauched into the street ata run, with drums beating, trumpets braying, bayonets levelled, thesappers at their head, and, imperturbable under the projectiles, chargedstraight for the barricade with the weight of a brazen beam against awall.</p><p>The wall held firm.</p><p>The insurgents fired impetuously. The barricade once scaled had a mane oflightning flashes. The assault was so furious, that for one moment, it wasinundated with assailants; but it shook off the soldiers as the lionshakes off the dogs, and it was only covered with besiegers as the cliffis covered with foam, to reappear, a moment later, beetling, black andformidable.</p><p>The column, forced to retreat, remained massed in the street, unprotectedbut terrible, and replied to the redoubt with a terrible discharge ofmusketry. Any one who has seen fireworks will recall the sheaf formed ofinterlacing lightnings which is called a bouquet. Let the reader pictureto himself this bouquet, no longer vertical but horizontal, bearing abullet, buckshot or a biscaïen at the tip of each one of its jets offlame, and picking off dead men one after another from its clusters oflightning. The barricade was underneath it.</p><p>On both sides, the resolution was equal. The bravery exhibited there wasalmost barbarous and was complicated with a sort of heroic ferocity whichbegan by the sacrifice of self.</p><p>This was the epoch when a National Guardsman fought like a Zouave. Thetroop wished to make an end of it, insurrection was desirous of fighting.The acceptance of the death agony in the flower of youth and in the flushof health turns intrepidity into frenzy. In this fray, each one underwentthe broadening growth of the death hour. The street was strewn withcorpses.</p><p>The barricade had Enjolras at one of its extremities and Marius at theother. Enjolras, who carried the whole barricade in his head, reserved andsheltered himself; three soldiers fell, one after the other, under hisembrasure, without having even seen him; Marius fought unprotected. Hemade himself a target. He stood with more than half his body above thebreastworks. There is no more violent prodigal than the avaricious man whotakes the bit in his teeth; there is no man more terrible in action than adreamer. Marius was formidable and pensive. In battle he was as in adream. One would have pronounced him a phantom engaged in firing a gun.</p><p>The insurgents&rsquo; cartridges were giving out; but not their sarcasms. Inthis whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they stood, they laughed.</p><p>Courfeyrac was bareheaded.</p><p>&ldquo;What have you done with your hat?&rdquo; Bossuet asked him.</p><p>Courfeyrac replied:</p><p>&ldquo;They have finally taken it away from me with cannon-balls.&rdquo;</p><p>Or they uttered haughty comments.</p><p>&ldquo;Can any one understand,&rdquo; exclaimed Feuilly bitterly, &ldquo;those men,&mdash;[andhe cited names, well-known names, even celebrated names, some belonging tothe old army]&mdash;who had promised to join us, and taken an oath to aidus, and who had pledged their honor to it, and who are our generals, andwho abandon us!&rdquo;</p><p>And Combeferre restricted himself to replying with a grave smile.</p><p>&ldquo;There are people who observe the rules of honor as one observes thestars, from a great distance.&rdquo;</p><p>The interior of the barricade was so strewn with torn cartridges that onewould have said that there had been a snowstorm.</p><p>The assailants had numbers in their favor; the insurgents had position.They were at the top of a wall, and they thundered point-blank upon thesoldiers tripping over the dead and wounded and entangled in theescarpment. This barricade, constructed as it was and admirablybuttressed, was really one of those situations where a handful of men holda legion in check. Nevertheless, the attacking column, constantlyrecruited and enlarged under the shower of bullets, drew inexorablynearer, and now, little by little, step by step, but surely, the armyclosed in around the barricade as the vice grasps the wine-press.</p><p>One assault followed another. The horror of the situation kept increasing.</p><p>Then there burst forth on that heap of paving-stones, in that Rue de laChanvrerie, a battle worthy of a wall of Troy. These haggard, ragged,exhausted men, who had had nothing to eat for four and twenty hours, whohad not slept, who had but a few more rounds to fire, who were fumbling intheir pockets which had been emptied of cartridges, nearly all of whomwere wounded, with head or arm bandaged with black and blood-stainedlinen, with holes in their clothes from which the blood trickled, and whowere hardly armed with poor guns and notched swords, became Titans. Thebarricade was ten times attacked, approached, assailed, scaled, and nevercaptured.</p><p>In order to form an idea of this struggle, it is necessary to imagine fireset to a throng of terrible courages, and then to gaze at theconflagration. It was not a combat, it was the interior of a furnace;there mouths breathed the flame; there countenances were extraordinary.The human form seemed impossible there, the combatants flamed forth there,and it was formidable to behold the going and coming in that red glow ofthose salamanders of the fray.</p><p>The successive and simultaneous scenes of this grand slaughter we renounceall attempts at depicting. The epic alone has the right to fill twelvethousand verses with a battle.</p><p>One would have pronounced this that hell of Brahmanism, the mostredoubtable of the seventeen abysses, which the Veda calls the Forest ofSwords.</p><p>They fought hand to hand, foot to foot, with pistol shots, with blows ofthe sword, with their fists, at a distance, close at hand, from above,from below, from everywhere, from the roofs of the houses, from thewindows of the wine-shop, from the cellar windows, whither some hadcrawled. They were one against sixty.</p><p>The façade of Corinthe, half demolished, was hideous. The window, tattooedwith grape-shot, had lost glass and frame and was nothing now but ashapeless hole, tumultuously blocked with paving-stones.</p><p>Bossuet was killed; Feuilly was killed; Courfeyrac was killed; Combeferre,transfixed by three blows from a bayonet in the breast at the moment whenhe was lifting up a wounded soldier, had only time to cast a glance toheaven when he expired.</p><p>Marius, still fighting, was so riddled with wounds, particularly in thehead, that his countenance disappeared beneath the blood, and one wouldhave said that his face was covered with a red kerchief.</p><p>Enjolras alone was not struck. When he had no longer any weapon, hereached out his hands to right and left and an insurgent thrust some armor other into his fist. All he had left was the stumps of four swords; onemore than François I. at Marignan. Homer says: &ldquo;Diomedes cuts the throatof Axylus, son of Teuthranis, who dwelt in happy Arisba; Euryalus, son ofMecistæus, exterminates Dresos and Opheltios, Esepius, and that Pedasuswhom the naiad Abarbarea bore to the blameless Bucolion; Ulyssesoverthrows Pidytes of Percosius; Antilochus, Ablerus; Polypætes,Astyalus; Polydamas, Otos, of Cyllene; and Teucer, Aretaon. Meganthiosdies under the blows of Euripylus&rsquo; pike. Agamemnon, king of the heroes,flings to earth Elatos, born in the rocky city which is laved by thesounding river Satnoïs.&rdquo; In our old poems of exploits, Esplandian attacksthe giant marquis Swantibore with a cobbler&rsquo;s shoulder-stick of fire, andthe latter defends himself by stoning the hero with towers which he plucksup by the roots. Our ancient mural frescoes show us the two Dukes ofBretagne and Bourbon, armed, emblazoned and crested in war-like guise, onhorseback and approaching each other, their battle-axes in hand, maskedwith iron, gloved with iron, booted with iron, the one caparisoned inermine, the other draped in azure: Bretagne with his lion between the twohorns of his crown, Bourbon helmeted with a monster fleur de lys on hisvisor. But, in order to be superb, it is not necessary to wear, like Yvon,the ducal morion, to have in the fist, like Esplandian, a living flame,or, like Phyles, father of Polydamas, to have brought back from Ephyra agood suit of mail, a present from the king of men, Euphetes; it sufficesto give one&rsquo;s life for a conviction or a loyalty. This ingenuous littlesoldier, yesterday a peasant of Bauce or Limousin, who prowls with hisclasp-knife by his side, around the children&rsquo;s nurses in the Luxembourggarden, this pale young student bent over a piece of anatomy or a book, ablond youth who shaves his beard with scissors,&mdash;take both of them,breathe upon them with a breath of duty, place them face to face in theCarrefour Boucherat or in the blind alley Planche-Mibray, and let the onefight for his flag, and the other for his ideal, and let both of themimagine that they are fighting for their country; the struggle will becolossal; and the shadow which this raw recruit and this sawbones inconflict will produce in that grand epic field where humanity is striving,will equal the shadow cast by Megaryon, King of Lycia, tiger-filled,crushing in his embrace the immense body of Ajax, equal to the gods.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0320" id="link2HCH0320"></a>CHAPTER XXII&mdash;FOOT TO FOOT</h3><p>When there were no longer any of the leaders left alive, except Enjolrasand Marius at the two extremities of the barricade, the centre, which hadso long sustained Courfeyrac, Joly, Bossuet, Feuilly and Combeferre, gaveway. The cannon, though it had not effected a practicable breach, had madea rather large hollow in the middle of the redoubt; there, the summit ofthe wall had disappeared before the balls, and had crumbled away; and therubbish which had fallen, now inside, now outside, had, as it accumulated,formed two piles in the nature of slopes on the two sides of the barrier,one on the inside, the other on the outside. The exterior slope presentedan inclined plane to the attack.</p><p>A final assault was there attempted, and this assault succeeded. The massbristling with bayonets and hurled forward at a run, came up withirresistible force, and the serried front of battle of the attackingcolumn made its appearance through the smoke on the crest of thebattlements. This time, it was decisive. The group of insurgents who weredefending the centre retreated in confusion.</p><p>Then the gloomy love of life awoke once more in some of them. Many,finding themselves under the muzzles of this forest of guns, did not wishto die. This is a moment when the instinct of self-preservation emitshowls, when the beast reappears in men. They were hemmed in by the lofty,six-story house which formed the background of their redoubt. This housemight prove their salvation. The building was barricaded, and walled, asit were, from top to bottom. Before the troops of the line had reached theinterior of the redoubt, there was time for a door to open and shut, thespace of a flash of lightning was sufficient for that, and the door ofthat house, suddenly opened a crack and closed again instantly, was lifefor these despairing men. Behind this house, there were streets, possibleflight, space. They set to knocking at that door with the butts of theirguns, and with kicks, shouting, calling, entreating, wringing their hands.No one opened. From the little window on the third floor, the head of thedead man gazed down upon them.</p><p>But Enjolras and Marius, and the seven or eight rallied about them, sprangforward and protected them. Enjolras had shouted to the soldiers: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;tadvance!&rdquo; and as an officer had not obeyed, Enjolras had killed theofficer. He was now in the little inner court of the redoubt, with hisback planted against the Corinthe building, a sword in one hand, a riflein the other, holding open the door of the wine-shop which he barredagainst assailants. He shouted to the desperate men:&mdash;&ldquo;There is butone door open; this one.&rdquo;&mdash;And shielding them with his body, andfacing an entire battalion alone, he made them pass in behind him. Allprecipitated themselves thither. Enjolras, executing with his rifle, whichhe now used like a cane, what single-stick players call a &ldquo;covered rose&rdquo; round his head, levelled the bayonets around and in front of him, and wasthe last to enter; and then ensued a horrible moment, when the soldierstried to make their way in, and the insurgents strove to bar them out. Thedoor was slammed with such violence, that, as it fell back into its frame,it showed the five fingers of a soldier who had been clinging to it, cutoff and glued to the post.</p><p>Marius remained outside. A shot had just broken his collar bone, he feltthat he was fainting and falling. At that moment, with eyes already shut,he felt the shock of a vigorous hand seizing him, and the swoon in whichhis senses vanished, hardly allowed him time for the thought, mingled witha last memory of Cosette:&mdash;&ldquo;I am taken prisoner. I shall be shot.&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras, not seeing Marius among those who had taken refuge in thewine-shop, had the same idea. But they had reached a moment when each manhas not the time to meditate on his own death. Enjolras fixed the baracross the door, and bolted it, and double-locked it with key and chain,while those outside were battering furiously at it, the soldiers with thebutts of their muskets, the sappers with their axes. The assailants weregrouped about that door. The siege of the wine-shop was now beginning.</p><p>The soldiers, we will observe, were full of wrath.</p><p>The death of the artillery-sergeant had enraged them, and then, a stillmore melancholy circumstance. During the few hours which had preceded theattack, it had been reported among them that the insurgents weremutilating their prisoners, and that there was the headless body of asoldier in the wine-shop. This sort of fatal rumor is the usualaccompaniment of civil wars, and it was a false report of this kind which,later on, produced the catastrophe of the Rue Transnonain.</p><p>When the door was barricaded, Enjolras said to the others:</p><p>&ldquo;Let us sell our lives dearly.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he approached the table on which lay Mabeuf and Gavroche. Beneath theblack cloth two straight and rigid forms were visible, one large, theother small, and the two faces were vaguely outlined beneath the coldfolds of the shroud. A hand projected from beneath the winding sheet andhung near the floor. It was that of the old man.</p><p>Enjolras bent down and kissed that venerable hand, just as he had kissedhis brow on the preceding evening.</p><p>These were the only two kisses which he had bestowed in the course of hislife.</p><p>Let us abridge the tale. The barricade had fought like a gate of Thebes;the wine-shop fought like a house of Saragossa. These resistances aredogged. No quarter. No flag of truce possible. Men are willing to die,provided their opponent will kill them.</p><p>When Suchet says:&mdash;&ldquo;Capitulate,&rdquo;&mdash;Palafox replies: &ldquo;After thewar with cannon, the war with knives.&rdquo; Nothing was lacking in the captureby assault of the Hucheloup wine-shop; neither paving-stones raining fromthe windows and the roof on the besiegers and exasperating the soldiers bycrushing them horribly, nor shots fired from the attic-windows and thecellar, nor the fury of attack, nor, finally, when the door yielded, thefrenzied madness of extermination. The assailants, rushing into thewine-shop, their feet entangled in the panels of the door which had beenbeaten in and flung on the ground, found not a single combatant there. Thespiral staircase, hewn asunder with the axe, lay in the middle of thetap-room, a few wounded men were just breathing their last, every one whowas not killed was on the first floor, and from there, through the hole inthe ceiling, which had formed the entrance of the stairs, a terrific fireburst forth. It was the last of their cartridges. When they wereexhausted, when these formidable men on the point of death had no longereither powder or ball, each grasped in his hands two of the bottles whichEnjolras had reserved, and of which we have spoken, and held the scalingparty in check with these frightfully fragile clubs. They were bottles ofaquafortis.</p><p>We relate these gloomy incidents of carnage as they occurred. The besiegedman, alas! converts everything into a weapon. Greek fire did not disgraceArchimedes, boiling pitch did not disgrace Bayard. All war is a thing ofterror, and there is no choice in it. The musketry of the besiegers,though confined and embarrassed by being directed from below upwards, wasdeadly. The rim of the hole in the ceiling was speedily surrounded byheads of the slain, whence dripped long, red and smoking streams, theuproar was indescribable; a close and burning smoke almost produced nightover this combat. Words are lacking to express horror when it has reachedthis pitch. There were no longer men in this conflict, which was nowinfernal. They were no longer giants matched with colossi. It resembledMilton and Dante rather than Homer. Demons attacked, spectres resisted.</p><p>It was heroism become monstrous.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0321" id="link2HCH0321"></a>CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;ORESTES FASTING AND PYLADES DRUNK</h3><p>At length, by dint of mounting on each other&rsquo;s backs, aiding themselveswith the skeleton of the staircase, climbing up the walls, clinging to theceiling, slashing away at the very brink of the trap-door, the last onewho offered resistance, a score of assailants, soldiers, NationalGuardsmen, municipal guardsmen, in utter confusion, the majoritydisfigured by wounds in the face during that redoubtable ascent, blindedby blood, furious, rendered savage, made an irruption into the apartmenton the first floor. There they found only one man still on his feet,Enjolras. Without cartridges, without sword, he had nothing in his handnow but the barrel of his gun whose stock he had broken over the head ofthose who were entering. He had placed the billiard table between hisassailants and himself; he had retreated into the corner of the room, andthere, with haughty eye, and head borne high, with this stump of a weaponin his hand, he was still so alarming as to speedily create an empty spacearound him. A cry arose:</p><p>&ldquo;He is the leader! It was he who slew the artillery-man. It is well thathe has placed himself there. Let him remain there. Let us shoot him downon the spot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shoot me,&rdquo; said Enjolras.</p><p>And flinging away his bit of gun-barrel, and folding his arms, he offeredhis breast.</p><p>The audacity of a fine death always affects men. As soon as Enjolrasfolded his arms and accepted his end, the din of strife ceased in theroom, and this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort of sepulchral solemnity.The menacing majesty of Enjolras disarmed and motionless, appeared tooppress this tumult, and this young man, haughty, bloody, and charming,who alone had not a wound, who was as indifferent as an invulnerablebeing, seemed, by the authority of his tranquil glance, to constrain thissinister rabble to kill him respectfully. His beauty, at that momentaugmented by his pride, was resplendent, and he was fresh and rosy afterthe fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed, as though hecould no more be fatigued than wounded. It was of him, possibly, that awitness spoke afterwards, before the council of war: &ldquo;There was aninsurgent whom I heard called Apollo.&rdquo; A National Guardsman who had takenaim at Enjolras, lowered his gun, saying: &ldquo;It seems to me that I am aboutto shoot a flower.&rdquo;</p><p>Twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite Enjolras, andsilently made ready their guns.</p><p>Then a sergeant shouted:</p><p>&ldquo;Take aim!&rdquo;</p><p>An officer intervened.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</p><p>And addressing Enjolras:</p><p>&ldquo;Do you wish to have your eyes bandaged?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Was it you who killed the artillery sergeant?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>Grantaire had waked up a few moments before.</p><p>Grantaire, it will be remembered, had been asleep ever since the precedingevening in the upper room of the wine-shop, seated on a chair and leaningon the table.</p><p>He realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of &ldquo;dead drunk.&rdquo; Thehideous potion of absinthe-porter and alcohol had thrown him into alethargy. His table being small, and not suitable for the barricade, hehad been left in possession of it. He was still in the same posture, withhis breast bent over the table, his head lying flat on his arms,surrounded by glasses, beer-jugs and bottles. His was the overwhelmingslumber of the torpid bear and the satiated leech. Nothing had had anyeffect upon it, neither the fusillade, nor the cannon-balls, nor thegrape-shot which had made its way through the window into the room wherehe was. Nor the tremendous uproar of the assault. He merely replied to thecannonade, now and then, by a snore. He seemed to be waiting there for abullet which should spare him the trouble of waking. Many corpses werestrewn around him; and, at the first glance, there was nothing todistinguish him from those profound sleepers of death.</p><p>Noise does not rouse a drunken man; silence awakens him. The fall ofeverything around him only augmented Grantaire&rsquo;s prostration; thecrumbling of all things was his lullaby. The sort of halt which the tumultunderwent in the presence of Enjolras was a shock to this heavy slumber.It had the effect of a carriage going at full speed, which suddenly comesto a dead stop. The persons dozing within it wake up. Grantaire rose tohis feet with a start, stretched out his arms, rubbed his eyes, stared,yawned, and understood.</p><p>A fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is tornaway. One beholds, at a single glance and as a whole, all that it hasconcealed. All suddenly presents itself to the memory; and the drunkardwho has known nothing of what has been taking place during the lasttwenty-four hours, has no sooner opened his eyes than he is perfectlyinformed. Ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity; the obliteration ofintoxication, a sort of steam which has obscured the brain, is dissipated,and makes way for the clear and sharply outlined importunity of realities.</p><p>Relegated, as he was, to one corner, and sheltered behind thebilliard-table, the soldiers whose eyes were fixed on Enjolras, had noteven noticed Grantaire, and the sergeant was preparing to repeat hisorder: &ldquo;Take aim!&rdquo; when all at once, they heard a strong voice shoutbeside them:</p><p>&ldquo;Long live the Republic! I&rsquo;m one of them.&rdquo;</p><p>Grantaire had risen. The immense gleam of the whole combat which he hadmissed, and in which he had had no part, appeared in the brilliant glanceof the transfigured drunken man.</p><p>He repeated: &ldquo;Long live the Republic!&rdquo; crossed the room with a firm strideand placed himself in front of the guns beside Enjolras.</p><p>&ldquo;Finish both of us at one blow,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>And turning gently to Enjolras, he said to him:</p><p>&ldquo;Do you permit it?&rdquo;</p><p>Enjolras pressed his hand with a smile.</p><p>This smile was not ended when the report resounded.</p><p>Enjolras, pierced by eight bullets, remained leaning against the wall, asthough the balls had nailed him there. Only, his head was bowed.</p><p>Grantaire fell at his feet, as though struck by a thunderbolt.</p><p>A few moments later, the soldiers dislodged the last remaining insurgents,who had taken refuge at the top of the house. They fired into the atticthrough a wooden lattice. They fought under the very roof. They flungbodies, some of them still alive, out through the windows. Twolight-infantrymen, who tried to lift the shattered omnibus, were slain bytwo shots fired from the attic. A man in a blouse was flung down from it,with a bayonet wound in the abdomen, and breathed his last on the ground.A soldier and an insurgent slipped together on the sloping slates of theroof, and, as they would not release each other, they fell, clasped in aferocious embrace. A similar conflict went on in the cellar. Shouts,shots, a fierce trampling. Then silence. The barricade was captured.</p><p>The soldiers began to search the houses round about, and to pursue thefugitives.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0322" id="link2HCH0322"></a>CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;PRISONER</h3><p>Marius was, in fact, a prisoner.</p><p>The hand which had seized him from behind and whose grasp he had felt atthe moment of his fall and his loss of consciousness was that of JeanValjean.</p><p>Jean Valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to expose himselfin it. Had it not been for him, no one, in that supreme phase of agony,would have thought of the wounded. Thanks to him, everywhere present inthe carnage, like a providence, those who fell were picked up, transportedto the tap-room, and cared for. In the intervals, he reappeared on thebarricade. But nothing which could resemble a blow, an attack or evenpersonal defence proceeded from his hands. He held his peace and lentsuccor. Moreover, he had received only a few scratches. The bullets wouldhave none of him. If suicide formed part of what he had meditated oncoming to this sepulchre, to that spot, he had not succeeded. But we doubtwhether he had thought of suicide, an irreligious act.</p><p>Jean Valjean, in the thick cloud of the combat, did not appear to seeMarius; the truth is, that he never took his eyes from the latter. When ashot laid Marius low, Jean Valjean leaped forward with the agility of atiger, fell upon him as on his prey, and bore him off.</p><p>The whirlwind of the attack was, at that moment, so violently concentratedupon Enjolras and upon the door of the wine-shop, that no one saw JeanValjean sustaining the fainting Marius in his arms, traverse the unpavedfield of the barricade and disappear behind the angle of the Corinthebuilding.</p><p>The reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on thestreet; it afforded shelter from the bullets, the grape-shot, and alleyes, and a few square feet of space. There is sometimes a chamber whichdoes not burn in the midst of a conflagration, and in the midst of ragingseas, beyond a promontory or at the extremity of a blind alley of shoals,a tranquil nook. It was in this sort of fold in the interior trapezium ofthe barricade, that Éponine had breathed her last.</p><p>There Jean Valjean halted, let Marius slide to the ground, placed his backagainst the wall, and cast his eyes about him.</p><p>The situation was alarming.</p><p>For an instant, for two or three perhaps, this bit of wall was a shelter,but how was he to escape from this massacre? He recalled the anguish whichhe had suffered in the Rue Polonceau eight years before, and in whatmanner he had contrived to make his escape; it was difficult then, to-dayit was impossible. He had before him that deaf and implacable house, sixstories in height, which appeared to be inhabited only by a dead manleaning out of his window; he had on his right the rather low barricade,which shut off the Rue de la Petite Truanderie; to pass this obstacleseemed easy, but beyond the crest of the barrier a line of bayonets wasvisible. The troops of the line were posted on the watch behind thatbarricade. It was evident, that to pass the barricade was to go in questof the fire of the platoon, and that any head which should run the risk oflifting itself above the top of that wall of stones would serve as atarget for sixty shots. On his left he had the field of battle. Deathlurked round the corner of that wall.</p><p>What was to be done?</p><p>Only a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament.</p><p>And it was necessary to decide on the instant, to devise some expedient,to come to some decision. Fighting was going on a few paces away;fortunately, all were raging around a single point, the door of thewine-shop; but if it should occur to one soldier, to one single soldier,to turn the corner of the house, or to attack him on the flank, all wasover.</p><p>Jean Valjean gazed at the house facing him, he gazed at the barricade atone side of him, then he looked at the ground, with the violence of thelast extremity, bewildered, and as though he would have liked to pierce ahole there with his eyes.</p><p>By dint of staring, something vaguely striking in such an agony began toassume form and outline at his feet, as though it had been a power ofglance which made the thing desired unfold. A few paces distant heperceived, at the base of the small barrier so pitilessly guarded andwatched on the exterior, beneath a disordered mass of paving-stones whichpartly concealed it, an iron grating, placed flat and on a level with thesoil. This grating, made of stout, transverse bars, was about two feetsquare. The frame of paving-stones which supported it had been torn up,and it was, as it were, unfastened.</p><p>Through the bars a view could be had of a dark aperture, something likethe flue of a chimney, or the pipe of a cistern. Jean Valjean dartedforward. His old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination. Tothrust aside the stones, to raise the grating, to lift Marius, who was asinert as a dead body, upon his shoulders, to descend, with this burden onhis loins, and with the aid of his elbows and knees into that sort ofwell, fortunately not very deep, to let the heavy trap, upon which theloosened stones rolled down afresh, fall into its place behind him, togain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below the surface,&mdash;allthis was executed like that which one does in dreams, with the strength ofa giant and the rapidity of an eagle; this took only a few minutes.</p><p>Jean Valjean found himself with Marius, who was still unconscious, in asort of long, subterranean corridor.</p><p>There reigned profound peace, absolute silence, night.</p><p>The impression which he had formerly experienced when falling from thewall into the convent recurred to him. Only, what he was carrying to-daywas not Cosette; it was Marius. He could barely hear the formidable tumultin the wine-shop, taken by assault, like a vague murmur overhead.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0372" id="link2H_4_0372"></a>BOOK SECOND&mdash;THE INTESTINE OF THE LEVIATHAN</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0323" id="link2HCH0323"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE LAND IMPOVERISHED BY THE SEA</h3><p>Paris casts twenty-five millions yearly into the water.

By means of its intestine. What is its intestine? Thesewer.</p><p>Twenty-five millions is the most moderate approximative figure which thevaluations of special science have set upon it.</p><p>Science, after having long groped about, now knows that the mostfecundating and the most efficacious of fertilizers is human manure. TheChinese, let us confess it to our shame, knew it before us. Not a Chinesepeasant&mdash;it is Eckberg who says this,&mdash;goes to town withoutbringing back with him, at the two extremities of his bamboo pole, twofull buckets of what we designate as filth. Thanks to human dung, theearth in China is still as young as in the days of Abraham. Chinese wheatyields a hundred fold of the seed. There is no guano comparable infertility with the detritus of a capital. A great city is the most mightyof dung-makers. Certain success would attend the experiment of employingthe city to manure the plain. If our gold is manure, our manure, on theother hand, is gold.</p><p>What is done with this golden manure? It is swept into the abyss.</p><p>Fleets of vessels are despatched, at great expense, to collect the dung ofpetrels and penguins at the South Pole, and the incalculable element ofopulence which we have on hand, we send to the sea. All the human andanimal manure which the world wastes, restored to the land instead ofbeing cast into the water, would suffice to nourish the world.</p><p>Those heaps of filth at the gate-posts, those tumbrils of mud which joltthrough the street by night, those terrible casks of the streetdepartment, those fetid drippings of subterranean mire, which thepavements hide from you,&mdash;do you know what they are? They are themeadow in flower, the green grass, wild thyme, thyme and sage, they aregame, they are cattle, they are the satisfied bellows of great oxen in theevening, they are perfumed hay, they are golden wheat, they are the breadon your table, they are the warm blood in your veins, they are health,they are joy, they are life. This is the will of that mysterious creationwhich is transformation on earth and transfiguration in heaven.</p><p>Restore this to the great crucible; your abundance will flow forth fromit. The nutrition of the plains furnishes the nourishment of men.</p><p>You have it in your power to lose this wealth, and to consider meridiculous to boot. This will form the master-piece of your ignorance.</p><p>Statisticians have calculated that France alone makes a deposit of half amilliard every year, in the Atlantic, through the mouths of her rivers.Note this: with five hundred millions we could pay one quarter of theexpenses of our budget. The cleverness of man is such that he prefers toget rid of these five hundred millions in the gutter. It is the verysubstance of the people that is carried off, here drop by drop, there waveafter wave, the wretched outpour of our sewers into the rivers, and thegigantic collection of our rivers into the ocean. Every hiccough of oursewers costs us a thousand francs. From this spring two results, the landimpoverished, and the water tainted. Hunger arising from the furrow, anddisease from the stream.</p><p>It is notorious, for example, that at the present hour, the Thames ispoisoning London.</p><p>So far as Paris is concerned, it has become indispensable of late, totransport the mouths of the sewers downstream, below the last bridge.</p><p>A double tubular apparatus, provided with valves and sluices, sucking upand driving back, a system of elementary drainage, simple as the lungs ofa man, and which is already in full working order in many communities inEngland, would suffice to conduct the pure water of the fields into ourcities, and to send back to the fields the rich water of the cities, andthis easy exchange, the simplest in the world, would retain among us thefive hundred millions now thrown away. People are thinking of otherthings.</p><p>The process actually in use does evil, with the intention of doing good.The intention is good, the result is melancholy. Thinking to purge thecity, the population is blanched like plants raised in cellars. A sewer isa mistake. When drainage, everywhere, with its double function, restoringwhat it takes, shall have replaced the sewer, which is a simpleimpoverishing washing, then, this being combined with the data of a nowsocial economy, the product of the earth will be increased tenfold, andthe problem of misery will be singularly lightened. Add the suppression ofparasitism, and it will be solved.</p><p>In the meanwhile, the public wealth flows away to the river, and leakagetakes place. Leakage is the word. Europe is being ruined in this manner byexhaustion.</p><p>As for France, we have just cited its figures. Now, Paris contains onetwenty-fifth of the total population of France, and Parisian guano beingthe richest of all, we understate the truth when we value the loss on thepart of Paris at twenty-five millions in the half milliard which Franceannually rejects. These twenty-five millions, employed in assistance andenjoyment, would double the splendor of Paris. The city spends them insewers. So that we may say that Paris&rsquo;s great prodigality, its wonderfulfestival, its Beaujon folly, its orgy, its stream of gold from full hands,its pomp, its luxury, its magnificence, is its sewer system.</p><p>It is in this manner that, in the blindness of a poor political economy,we drown and allow to float downstream and to be lost in the gulfs thewell-being of all. There should be nets at Saint-Cloud for the publicfortune.</p><p>Economically considered, the matter can be summed up thus: Paris is aspendthrift. Paris, that model city, that patron of well-arrangedcapitals, of which every nation strives to possess a copy, that metropolisof the ideal, that august country of the initiative, of impulse and ofeffort, that centre and that dwelling of minds, that nation-city, thathive of the future, that marvellous combination of Babylon and Corinth,would make a peasant of the Fo-Kian shrug his shoulders, from the point ofview which we have just indicated.</p><p>Imitate Paris and you will ruin yourselves.</p><p>Moreover, and particularly in this immemorial and senseless waste, Parisis itself an imitator.</p><p>These surprising exhibitions of stupidity are not novel; this is no youngfolly. The ancients did like the moderns. &ldquo;The sewers of Rome,&rdquo; saysLiebig, &ldquo;have absorbed all the well-being of the Roman peasant.&rdquo; When theCampagna of Rome was ruined by the Roman sewer, Rome exhausted Italy, andwhen she had put Italy in her sewer, she poured in Sicily, then Sardinia,then Africa. The sewer of Rome has engulfed the world. This cesspooloffered its engulfment to the city and the universe. <i>Urbi et orbi</i>. Eternalcity, unfathomable sewer.</p><p>Rome sets the example for these things as well as for others.</p><p>Paris follows this example with all the stupidity peculiar to intelligenttowns.</p><p>For the requirements of the operation upon the subject of which we havejust explained our views, Paris has beneath it another Paris; a Paris ofsewers; which has its streets, its crossroads, its squares, itsblind-alleys, its arteries, and its circulation, which is of mire andminus the human form.</p><p>For nothing must be flattered, not even a great people; where there iseverything there is also ignominy by the side of sublimity; and, if Pariscontains Athens, the city of light, Tyre, the city of might, Sparta, thecity of virtue, Nineveh, the city of marvels, it also contains Lutetia,the city of mud.</p><p>However, the stamp of its power is there also, and the Titanic sink ofParis realizes, among monuments, that strange ideal realized in humanityby some men like Macchiavelli, Bacon and Mirabeau, grandiose vileness.</p><p>The sub-soil of Paris, if the eye could penetrate its surface, wouldpresent the aspect of a colossal madrepore. A sponge has no morepartitions and ducts than the mound of earth for a circuit of six leaguesround about, on which rests the great and ancient city. Not to mention itscatacombs, which are a separate cellar, not to mention the inextricabletrellis-work of gas pipes, without reckoning the vast tubular system forthe distribution of fresh water which ends in the pillar fountains, thesewers alone form a tremendous, shadowy network under the two banks; alabyrinth which has its slope for its guiding thread.</p><p>There appears, in the humid mist, the rat which seems the product to whichParis has given birth.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0324" id="link2HCH0324"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE SEWER</h3><p>Let the reader imagine Paris lifted off like a cover, the subterraneannetwork of sewers, from a bird&rsquo;s-eye view, will outline on the banks aspecies of large branch grafted on the river.

The masses regarded these beds ofdecomposition, these monstrous cradles of death, with a fear that wasalmost religious. The vermin ditch of Benares is no less conducive togiddiness than the lions&rsquo; ditch of Babylon. Teglath-Phalasar, according tothe rabbinical books, swore by the sink of Nineveh. It was from the sewerof Münster that John of Leyden produced his false moon, and it was fromthe cesspool of Kekscheb that oriental menalchme, Mokanna, the veiledprophet of Khorassan, caused his false sun to emerge.</p><p>The history of men is reflected in the history of sewers. The Germoniæ<ahref="#linknote-58" name="linknoteref-58" id="linknoteref-58">58</a>narrated Rome. The sewer of Paris has been an ancient and formidablething. It has been a sepulchre, it has served as an asylum. Crime,intelligence, social protest, liberty of conscience, thought, theft, allthat human laws persecute or have persecuted, is hidden in that hole; the<i>maillotins</i> in the fourteenth century, the <i>tire-laine</i> of the fifteenth, theHuguenots in the sixteenth, Morin&rsquo;s <i>illuminated</i> in the seventeenth, the<i>chauffeurs</i> [brigands] in the eighteenth. A hundred years ago, thenocturnal blow of the dagger emerged thence, the pickpocket in dangerslipped thither; the forest had its cave, Paris had its sewer. Vagrancy,that Gallic <i>picareria</i>, accepted the sewer as the adjunct of the Cour desMiracles, and at evening, it returned thither, fierce and sly, through theMaubuée outlet, as into a bed-chamber.</p><p>It was quite natural, that those who had the blind-alley Vide-Gousset,[Empty-Pocket] or the Rue Coupe-Gorge [Cut-Throat], for the scene of theirdaily labor, should have for their domicile by night the culvert of theChemin-Vert, or the catch basin of Hurepoix. Hence a throng of souvenirs.All sorts of phantoms haunt these long, solitary corridors; everywhere isputrescence and miasma; here and there are breathing-holes, where Villonwithin converses with Rabelais without.</p><p>The sewer in ancient Paris is the rendezvous of all exhaustions and of allattempts. Political economy therein spies a detritus, social philosophythere beholds a residuum.</p><p>The sewer is the conscience of the city. Everything there converges andconfronts everything else. In that livid spot there are shades, but thereare no longer any secrets. Each thing bears its true form, or at least,its definitive form. The mass of filth has this in its favor, that it isnot a liar. Ingenuousness has taken refuge there. The mask of Basil is tobe found there, but one beholds its cardboard and its strings and theinside as well as the outside, and it is accentuated by honest mud.Scapin&rsquo;s false nose is its next-door neighbor. All the uncleannesses ofcivilization, once past their use, fall into this trench of truth, wherethe immense social sliding ends. They are there engulfed, but they displaythemselves there. This mixture is a confession. There, no more falseappearances, no plastering over is possible, filth removes its shirt,absolute denudation puts to the rout all illusions and mirages, there isnothing more except what really exists, presenting the sinister form ofthat which is coming to an end. There, the bottom of a bottle indicatesdrunkenness, a basket-handle tells a tale of domesticity; there the coreof an apple which has entertained literary opinions becomes an apple-coreonce more; the effigy on the big sou becomes frankly covered withverdigris, Caiphas&rsquo; spittle meets Falstaff&rsquo;s puking, the louis-d&rsquo;or whichcomes from the gaming-house jostles the nail whence hangs the rope&rsquo;s endof the suicide. A livid fœtus rolls along, enveloped in the spangleswhich danced at the Opera last Shrove-Tuesday, a cap which has pronouncedjudgment on men wallows beside a mass of rottenness which was formerlyMargoton&rsquo;s petticoat; it is more than fraternization, it is equivalent toaddressing each other as <i>thou</i>. All which was formerly rouged, is washedfree. The last veil is torn away. A sewer is a cynic. It tells everything.</p><p>The sincerity of foulness pleases us, and rests the soul. When one haspassed one&rsquo;s time in enduring upon earth the spectacle of the great airswhich reasons of state, the oath, political sagacity, human justice,professional probity, the austerities of situation, incorruptible robesall assume, it solaces one to enter a sewer and to behold the mire whichbefits it.</p><p>This is instructive at the same time. We have just said that historypasses through the sewer. The Saint-Barthélemys filter through there, dropby drop, between the paving-stones. Great public assassinations, politicaland religious butcheries, traverse this underground passage ofcivilization, and thrust their corpses there. For the eye of the thinker,all historic murderers are to be found there, in that hideous penumbra, ontheir knees, with a scrap of their winding-sheet for an apron, dismallysponging out their work. Louis XI. is there with Tristan, François I. withDuprat, Charles IX. is there with his mother, Richelieu is there withLouis XIII., Louvois is there, Letellier is there, Hébert and Maillard arethere, scratching the stones, and trying to make the traces of theiractions disappear. Beneath these vaults one hears the brooms of spectres.One there breathes the enormous fetidness of social catastrophes. Onebeholds reddish reflections in the corners. There flows a terrible stream,in which bloody hands have been washed.</p><p>The social observer should enter these shadows. They form a part of hislaboratory. Philosophy is the microscope of the thought. Everythingdesires to flee from it, but nothing escapes it. Tergiversation isuseless. What side of oneself does one display in evasions? the shamefulside. Philosophy pursues with its glance, probes the evil, and does notpermit it to escape into nothingness. In the obliteration of things whichdisappear, in the watching of things which vanish, it recognizes all. Itreconstructs the purple from the rag, and the woman from the scrap of herdress. From the cesspool, it reconstitutes the city; from mud, itreconstructs manners; from the potsherd it infers the amphora or the jug.By the imprint of a finger-nail on a piece of parchment, it recognizes thedifference which separates the Jewry of the Judengasse from the Jewry ofthe Ghetto. It re-discovers in what remains that which has been, good,evil, the true, the blood-stain of the palace, the ink-blot of the cavern,the drop of sweat from the brothel, trials undergone, temptationswelcomed, orgies cast forth, the turn which characters have taken as theybecame abased, the trace of prostitution in souls of which their grossnessrendered them capable, and on the vesture of the porters of Rome the markof Messalina&rsquo;s elbowing.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0325" id="link2HCH0325"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;BRUNESEAU</h3><p>The sewer of Paris in the Middle Ages was legendary. In the sixteenthcentury, Henri II. attempted a bore, which failed. Not a hundred yearsago, the cesspool, Mercier attests the fact, was abandoned to itself, andfared as best it might.</p><p>Such was this ancient Paris, delivered over to quarrels, to indecision,and to gropings. It was tolerably stupid for a long time. Later on, &rsquo;89showed how understanding comes to cities. But in the good, old times, thecapital had not much head. It did not know how to manage its own affairseither morally or materially, and could not sweep out filth any betterthan it could abuses. Everything presented an obstacle, everything raiseda question. The sewer, for example, was refractory to every itinerary. Onecould no more find one&rsquo;s bearings in the sewer than one could understandone&rsquo;s position in the city; above the unintelligible, below theinextricable; beneath the confusion of tongues there reigned the confusionof caverns; Dædalus backed up Babel.</p><p>Sometimes the Paris sewer took a notion to overflow, as though thismisunderstood Nile were suddenly seized with a fit of rage. Thereoccurred, infamous to relate, inundations of the sewer. At times, thatstomach of civilization digested badly, the cesspool flowed back into thethroat of the city, and Paris got an after-taste of her own filth. Theseresemblances of the sewer to remorse had their good points; they werewarnings; very badly accepted, however; the city waxed indignant at theaudacity of its mire, and did not admit that the filth should return.Drive it out better.</p><p>The inundation of 1802 is one of the actual memories of Parisians of theage of eighty. The mud spread in cross-form over the Place des Victoires,where stands the statue of Louis XIV.; it entered the Rue Saint-Honoré bythe two mouths to the sewer in the Champs-Élysées, the Rue Saint-Florentinthrough the Saint-Florentin sewer, the Rue Pierre-à-Poisson through thesewer de la Sonnerie, the Rue Popincourt, through the sewer of theChemin-Vert, the Rue de la Roquette, through the sewer of the Rue deLappe; it covered the drain of the Rue des Champs-Élysées to the height ofthirty-five centimetres; and, to the South, through the vent of the Seine,performing its functions in inverse sense, it penetrated the Rue Mazarine,the Rue de l&rsquo;Échaudé, and the Rue des Marais, where it stopped at adistance of one hundred and nine metres, a few paces distant from thehouse in which Racine had lived, respecting, in the seventeenth century,the poet more than the King. It attained its maximum depth in the RueSaint-Pierre, where it rose to the height of three feet above theflag-stones of the water-spout, and its maximum length in the RueSaint-Sabin, where it spread out over a stretch two hundred andthirty-eight metres in length.</p><p>At the beginning of this century, the sewer of Paris was still amysterious place. Mud can never enjoy a good fame; but in this case itsevil renown reached the verge of the terrible. Paris knew, in a confusedway, that she had under her a terrible cavern. People talked of it as ofthat monstrous bed of Thebes in which swarmed centipedes fifteen long feetin length, and which might have served Behemoth for a bathtub. The greatboots of the sewermen never ventured further than certain well-knownpoints. We were then very near the epoch when the scavenger&rsquo;s carts, fromthe summit of which Sainte-Foix fraternized with the Marquis de Créqui,discharged their loads directly into the sewer. As for cleaning out,&mdash;thatfunction was entrusted to the pouring rains which encumbered rather thanswept away. Rome left some poetry to her sewer, and called it theGemoniæ; Paris insulted hers, and entitled it the Polypus-Hole. Scienceand superstition were in accord, in horror. The Polypus hole was no lessrepugnant to hygiene than to legend. The goblin was developed under thefetid covering of the Mouffetard sewer; the corpses of the Marmousets hadbeen cast into the sewer de la Barillerie; Fagon attributed theredoubtable malignant fever of 1685 to the great hiatus of the sewer ofthe Marais, which remained yawning until 1833 in the Rue Saint-Louis,almost opposite the sign of the <i>Gallant Messenger</i>. The mouth of the sewerof the Rue de la Mortellerie was celebrated for the pestilences which hadtheir source there; with its grating of iron, with points simulating a rowof teeth, it was like a dragon&rsquo;s maw in that fatal street, breathing forthhell upon men. The popular imagination seasoned the sombre Parisian sinkwith some indescribably hideous intermixture of the infinite. The sewerhad no bottom. The sewer was the lower world. The idea of exploring theseleprous regions did not even occur to the police. To try that unknownthing, to cast the plummet into that shadow, to set out on a voyage ofdiscovery in that abyss&mdash;who would have dared? It was alarming.Nevertheless, some one did present himself. The cesspool had itsChristopher Columbus.</p><p>One day, in 1805, during one of the rare apparitions which the Emperormade in Paris, the Minister of the Interior, some Decrès or Crétet orother, came to the master&rsquo;s intimate levee. In the Carrousel there wasaudible the clanking of swords of all those extraordinary soldiers of thegreat Republic, and of the great Empire; then Napoleon&rsquo;s door was blockedwith heroes; men from the Rhine, from the Escaut, from the Adige, and fromthe Nile; companions of Joubert, of Desaix, of Marceau, of Hoche, ofKléber; the aérostiers of Fleurus, the grenadiers of Mayence, thepontoon-builders of Genoa, hussars whom the Pyramids had looked down upon,artillerists whom Junot&rsquo;s cannon-ball had spattered with mud, cuirassierswho had taken by assault the fleet lying at anchor in the Zuyderzee; somehad followed Bonaparte upon the bridge of Lodi, others had accompaniedMurat in the trenches of Mantua, others had preceded Lannes in the hollowroad of Montebello. The whole army of that day was present there, in thecourt-yard of the Tuileries, represented by a squadron or a platoon, andguarding Napoleon in repose; and that was the splendid epoch when thegrand army had Marengo behind it and Austerlitz before it.&mdash;&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said the Minister of the Interior to Napoleon, &ldquo;yesterday I saw the mostintrepid man in your Empire.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What man is that?&rdquo; said the Emperorbrusquely, &ldquo;and what has he done?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He wants to do something, Sire.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Whatis it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;To visit the sewers of Paris.&rdquo;</p><p>This man existed and his name was Bruneseau.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0326" id="link2HCH0326"></a>CHAPTER IV</h3><p>The visit took place. It was a formidable campaign; a nocturnal battleagainst pestilence and suffocation. It was, at the same time, a voyage ofdiscovery. One of the survivors of this expedition, an intelligentworkingman, who was very young at the time, related curious details withregard to it, several years ago, which Bruneseau thought himself obligedto omit in his report to the prefect of police, as unworthy of officialstyle. The processes of disinfection were, at that epoch, extremelyrudimentary. Hardly had Bruneseau crossed the first articulations of thatsubterranean network, when eight laborers out of the twenty refused to goany further. The operation was complicated; the visit entailed thenecessity of cleaning; hence it was necessary to cleanse and at the sametime, to proceed; to note the entrances of water, to count the gratingsand the vents, to lay out in detail the branches, to indicate the currentsat the point where they parted, to define the respective bounds of thedivers basins, to sound the small sewers grafted on the principal sewer,to measure the height under the key-stone of each drain, and the width, atthe spring of the vaults as well as at the bottom, in order to determinethe arrangements with regard to the level of each water-entrance, eitherof the bottom of the arch, or on the soil of the street. They advancedwith toil. The lanterns pined away in the foul atmosphere. From time totime, a fainting sewerman was carried out. At certain points, there wereprecipices. The soil had given away, the pavement had crumbled, the sewerhad changed into a bottomless well; they found nothing solid; a mandisappeared suddenly; they had great difficulty in getting him out again.On the advice of Fourcroy, they lighted large cages filled with towsteeped in resin, from time to time, in spots which had been sufficientlydisinfected. In some places, the wall was covered with misshapen fungi,&mdash;onewould have said tumors; the very stone seemed diseased within thisunbreathable atmosphere.</p><p>Bruneseau, in his exploration, proceeded down hill. At the point ofseparation of the two water-conduits of the Grand-Hurleur, he decipheredupon a projecting stone the date of 1550; this stone indicated the limitswhere Philibert Delorme, charged by Henri II. with visiting thesubterranean drains of Paris, had halted. This stone was the mark of thesixteenth century on the sewer; Bruneseau found the handiwork of theseventeenth century once more in the Ponceau drain of the old RueVieille-du-Temple, vaulted between 1600 and 1650; and the handiwork of theeighteenth in the western section of the collecting canal, walled andvaulted in 1740. These two vaults, especially the less ancient, that of1740, were more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the belt sewer,which dated from 1412, an epoch when the brook of fresh water ofMénilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the Grand Sewer of Paris, anadvancement analogous to that of a peasant who should become first <i>valetde chambre</i> to the King; something like Gros-Jean transformed into Lebel.</p><p>Here and there, particularly beneath the Court-House, they thought theyrecognized the hollows of ancient dungeons, excavated in the very seweritself. Hideous <i>in-pace</i>. An iron neck-collar was hanging in one of thesecells. They walled them all up. Some of their finds were singular; amongothers, the skeleton of an ourang-outan, who had disappeared from theJardin des Plantes in 1800, a disappearance probably connected with thefamous and indisputable apparition of the devil in the Rue des Bernardins,in the last year of the eighteenth century. The poor devil had ended bydrowning himself in the sewer.</p><p>Beneath this long, arched drain which terminated at the Arche-Marion, aperfectly preserved rag-picker&rsquo;s basket excited the admiration of allconnoisseurs. Everywhere, the mire, which the sewermen came to handle withintrepidity, abounded in precious objects, jewels of gold and silver,precious stones, coins. If a giant had filtered this cesspool, he wouldhave had the riches of centuries in his lair. At the point where the twobranches of the Rue du Temple and of the Rue Sainte-Avoye separate, theypicked up a singular Huguenot medal in copper, bearing on one side the pighooded with a cardinal&rsquo;s hat, and on the other, a wolf with a tiara on hishead.</p><p>The most surprising rencounter was at the entrance to the Grand Sewer.This entrance had formerly been closed by a grating of which nothing butthe hinges remained. From one of these hinges hung a dirty and shapelessrag which, arrested there in its passage, no doubt, had floated there inthe darkness and finished its process of being torn apart. Bruneseau heldhis lantern close to this rag and examined it. It was of very finebatiste, and in one of the corners, less frayed than the rest, they madeout a heraldic coronet and embroidered above these seven letters: LAVBESP.The crown was the coronet of a Marquis, and the seven letters signified<i>Laubespine</i>. They recognized the fact, that what they had before their eyeswas a morsel of the shroud of Marat. Marat in his youth had had amorousintrigues. This was when he was a member of the household of the Comted&rsquo;Artois, in the capacity of physician to the Stables. From these loveaffairs, historically proved, with a great lady, he had retained thissheet. As a waif or a souvenir. At his death, as this was the only linenof any fineness which he had in his house, they buried him in it. Some oldwomen had shrouded him for the tomb in that swaddling-band in which thetragic Friend of the people had enjoyed voluptuousness. Bruneseau passedon. They left that rag where it hung; they did not put the finishing touchto it. Did this arise from scorn or from respect? Marat deserved both. Andthen, destiny was there sufficiently stamped to make them hesitate totouch it. Besides, the things of the sepulchre must be left in the spotwhich they select. In short, the relic was a strange one. A Marquise hadslept in it; Marat had rotted in it; it had traversed the Pantheon to endwith the rats of the sewer. This chamber rag, of which Watteau wouldformerly have joyfully sketched every fold, had ended in becoming worthyof the fixed gaze of Dante.</p><p>The whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of Paris lasted sevenyears, from 1805 to 1812. As he proceeded, Bruneseau drew, directed, andcompleted considerable works; in 1808 he lowered the arch of the Ponceau,and, everywhere creating new lines, he pushed the sewer, in 1809, underthe Rue Saint-Denis as far as the fountain of the Innocents; in 1810,under the Rue Froidmanteau and under the Salpêtrière; in 1811 under theRue Neuve-des-Petits-Pères, under the Rue du Mail, under the Rue del&rsquo;Écharpe, under the Place Royale; in 1812, under the Rue de la Paix, andunder the Chaussée d&rsquo;Antin. At the same time, he had the whole networkdisinfected and rendered healthful. In the second year of his work,Bruneseau engaged the assistance of his son-in-law Nargaud.</p><p>It was thus that, at the beginning of the century, ancient societycleansed its double bottom, and performed the toilet of its sewer. Therewas that much clean, at all events.</p><p>Tortuous, cracked, unpaved, full of fissures, intersected by gullies,jolted by eccentric elbows, mounting and descending illogically, fetid,wild, fierce, submerged in obscurity, with cicatrices on its pavements andscars on its walls, terrible,&mdash;such was, retrospectively viewed, theantique sewer of Paris. Ramifications in every direction, crossings, oftrenches, branches, goose-feet, stars, as in military mines, cœcum, blindalleys, vaults lined with saltpetre, pestiferous pools, scabby sweats, onthe walls, drops dripping from the ceilings, darkness; nothing could equalthe horror of this old, waste crypt, the digestive apparatus of Babylon, acavern, ditch, gulf pierced with streets, a titanic mole-burrow, where themind seems to behold that enormous blind mole, the past, prowling throughthe shadows, in the filth which has been splendor.</p><p>This, we repeat, was the sewer of the past.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0327" id="link2HCH0327"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;PRESENT PROGRESS</h3><p>To-day the sewer is clean, cold, straight, correct. It almost realizes theideal of what is understood in England by the word &ldquo;respectable.&rdquo; It isproper and grayish; laid out by rule and line; one might almost say asthough it came out of a bandbox. It resembles a tradesman who has become acouncillor of state. One can almost see distinctly there. The mire therecomports itself with decency. At first, one might readily mistake it forone of those subterranean corridors, which were so common in former days,and so useful in flights of monarchs and princes, in those good old times,&ldquo;when the people loved their kings.&rdquo; The present sewer is a beautifulsewer; the pure style reigns there; the classical rectilinear alexandrinewhich, driven out of poetry, appears to have taken refuge in architecture,seems mingled with all the stones of that long, dark and whitish vault;each outlet is an arcade; the Rue de Rivoli serves as pattern even in thesewer. However, if the geometrical line is in place anywhere, it iscertainly in the drainage trench of a great city. There, everything shouldbe subordinated to the shortest road. The sewer has, nowadays, assumed acertain official aspect. The very police reports, of which it sometimesforms the subject, no longer are wanting in respect towards it. The wordswhich characterize it in administrative language are sonorous anddignified. What used to be called a gut is now called a gallery; what usedto be called a hole is now called a surveying orifice. Villon would nolonger meet with his ancient temporary provisional lodging. This networkof cellars has its immemorial population of prowlers, rodents, swarming ingreater numbers than ever; from time to time, an aged and veteran ratrisks his head at the window of the sewer and surveys the Parisians; buteven these vermin grow tame, so satisfied are they with their subterraneanpalace. The cesspool no longer retains anything of its primitive ferocity.The rain, which in former days soiled the sewer, now washes it.Nevertheless, do not trust yourself too much to it. Miasmas still inhabitit. It is more hypocritical than irreproachable. The prefecture of policeand the commission of health have done their best. But, in spite of allthe processes of disinfection, it exhales, a vague, suspicious odor likeTartuffe after confession.</p><p>Let us confess, that, taking it all in all, this sweeping is a homagewhich the sewer pays to civilization, and as, from this point of view,Tartuffe&rsquo;s conscience is a progress over the Augean stables, it is certainthat the sewers of Paris have been improved.</p><p>It is more than progress; it is transmutation.

What has effected this revolution?</p><p>The man whom all the world forgets, and whom we have mentioned, Bruneseau.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0328" id="link2HCH0328"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;FUTURE PROGRESS</h3><p>The excavation of the sewer of Paris has been no slight task. The last tencenturies have toiled at it without being able to bring it to atermination, any more than they have been able to finish Paris. The sewer,in fact, receives all the counter-shocks of the growth of Paris. Withinthe bosom of the earth, it is a sort of mysterious polyp with a thousandantennæ, which expands below as the city expands above. Every time thatthe city cuts a street, the sewer stretches out an arm. The old monarchyhad constructed only twenty-three thousand three hundred metres of sewers;that was where Paris stood in this respect on the first of January, 1806.Beginning with this epoch, of which we shall shortly speak, the work wasusefully and energetically resumed and prosecuted; Napoleon built&mdash;thefigures are curious&mdash;four thousand eight hundred and four metres;Louis XVIII., five thousand seven hundred and nine; Charles X., tenthousand eight hundred and thirty-six; Louis-Philippe, eighty-ninethousand and twenty; the Republic of 1848, twenty-three thousand threehundred and eighty-one; the present government, seventy thousand fivehundred; in all, at the present time, two hundred and twenty-six thousandsix hundred and ten metres; sixty leagues of sewers; the enormous entrailsof Paris. An obscure ramification ever at work; a construction which isimmense and ignored.</p><p>As the reader sees, the subterranean labyrinth of Paris is to-day morethan ten times what it was at the beginning of the century. It isdifficult to form any idea of all the perseverance and the efforts whichhave been required to bring this cesspool to the point of relativeperfection in which it now is. It was with great difficulty that theancient monarchical provostship and, during the last ten years of theeighteenth century, the revolutionary mayoralty, had succeeded inperforating the five leagues of sewer which existed previous to 1806. Allsorts of obstacles hindered this operation, some peculiar to the soil,others inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious population ofParis. Paris is built upon a soil which is singularly rebellious to thepick, the hoe, the bore, and to human manipulation. There is nothing moredifficult to pierce and to penetrate than the geological formation uponwhich is superposed the marvellous historical formation called Paris; assoon as work in any form whatsoever is begun and adventures upon thisstretch of alluvium, subterranean resistances abound. There are liquidclays, springs, hard rocks, and those soft and deep quagmires whichspecial science calls <i>moutardes</i>.<a href="#linknote-59" name="linknoteref-59" id="linknoteref-59">59</a> The pick advanceslaboriously through the calcareous layers alternating with very slenderthreads of clay, and schistose beds in plates incrusted withoyster-shells, the contemporaries of the pre-Adamite oceans. Sometimes arivulet suddenly bursts through a vault that has been begun, and inundatesthe laborers; or a layer of marl is laid bare, and rolls down with thefury of a cataract, breaking the stoutest supporting beams like glass.Quite recently, at Villette, when it became necessary to pass thecollecting sewer under the Saint-Martin canal without interruptingnavigation or emptying the canal, a fissure appeared in the basin of thecanal, water suddenly became abundant in the subterranean tunnel, whichwas beyond the power of the pumping engines; it was necessary to send adiver to explore the fissure which had been made in the narrow entrance ofthe grand basin, and it was not without great difficulty that it wasstopped up. Elsewhere near the Seine, and even at a considerable distancefrom the river, as for instance, at Belleville, Grand-Rue and LumièrePassage, quicksands are encountered in which one sticks fast, and in whicha man sinks visibly. Add suffocation by miasmas, burial by slides, andsudden crumbling of the earth. Add the typhus, with which the workmenbecome slowly impregnated. In our own day, after having excavated thegallery of Clichy, with a banquette to receive the principal water-conduitof Ourcq, a piece of work which was executed in a trench ten metres deep;after having, in the midst of land-slides, and with the aid of excavationsoften putrid, and of shoring up, vaulted the Bièvre from the Boulevard del&rsquo;Hôpital, as far as the Seine; after having, in order to deliver Parisfrom the floods of Montmartre and in order to provide an outlet for thatriver-like pool nine hectares in extent, which crouched near the Barrièredes Martyrs, after having, let us state, constructed the line of sewersfrom the Barrière Blanche to the road of Aubervilliers, in four months,working day and night, at a depth of eleven metres; after having&mdash;athing heretofore unseen&mdash;made a subterranean sewer in the RueBarre-du-Bec, without a trench, six metres below the surface, thesuperintendent, Monnot, died. After having vaulted three thousand metresof sewer in all quarters of the city, from the RueTraversière-Saint-Antoine to the Rue de l&rsquo;Ourcine, after having freed theCarrefour Censier-Mouffetard from inundations of rain by means of thebranch of the Arbalète, after having built the Saint-Georges sewer, onrock and concrete in the fluid sands, after having directed the formidablelowering of the flooring of the vault timber in the Notre-Dame-de-Nazarethbranch, Duleau the engineer died. There are no bulletins for such acts ofbravery as these, which are more useful, nevertheless, than the brutalslaughter of the field of battle.</p><p>The sewers of Paris in 1832 were far from being what they are to-day.Bruneseau had given the impulse, but the cholera was required to bringabout the vast reconstruction which took place later on. It is surprisingto say, for example, that in 1821, a part of the belt sewer, called theGrand Canal, as in Venice, still stood stagnating uncovered to the sky, inthe Rue des Gourdes. It was only in 1821 that the city of Paris found inits pocket the two hundred and sixty-thousand eighty francs and sixcentimes required for covering this mass of filth. The three absorbingwells, of the Combat, the Cunette, and Saint-Mandé, with their dischargingmouths, their apparatus, their cesspools, and their depuratory branches,only date from 1836. The intestinal sewer of Paris has been made overanew, and, as we have said, it has been extended more than tenfold withinthe last quarter of a century.</p><p>Thirty years ago, at the epoch of the insurrection of the 5th and 6th of June,it was still, in many localities, nearly the same ancient sewer. A very greatnumber of streets which are now convex were then sunken causeways. At the endof a slope, where the tributaries of a street or crossroads ended, there wereoften to be seen large, square gratings with heavy bars, whose iron, polishedby the footsteps of the throng, gleamed dangerous and slippery for vehicles,and caused horses to fall. The official language of the Roads and Bridges gaveto these gratings the expressive name of <i>Cassis</i>.<a href="#linknote-60" name="linknoteref-60" id="linknoteref-60">60</a></p><p>In 1832, in a number of streets, in the Rue de l&rsquo;Étoile, the RueSaint-Louis, the Rue du Temple, the Rue Vieille-du-Temple, the RueNotre-Dame de Nazareth, the Rue Folie-Méricourt, the Quai aux Fleurs, theRue du Petit-Musc, the Rue du Normandie, the Rue Pont-Aux-Biches, the Ruedes Marais, the Faubourg Saint-Martin, the Rue Notre Dame des-Victoires,the Faubourg Montmartre, the Rue Grange-Batelière, in the Champs-Élysées,the Rue Jacob, the Rue de Tournon, the ancient gothic sewer stillcynically displayed its maw. It consisted of enormous voids of stonecatch-basins sometimes surrounded by stone posts, with monumentaleffrontery.</p><p>Paris in 1806 still had nearly the same sewers numerically as stated in1663; five thousand three hundred fathoms. After Bruneseau, on the 1st ofJanuary, 1832, it had forty thousand three hundred metres. Between 1806and 1831, there had been built, on an average, seven hundred and fiftymetres annually, afterwards eight and even ten thousand metres ofgalleries were constructed every year, in masonry, of small stones, withhydraulic mortar which hardens under water, on a cement foundation. At twohundred francs the metre, the sixty leagues of Paris&rsquo; sewers of thepresent day represent forty-eight millions.</p><p>In addition to the economic progress which we have indicated at thebeginning, grave problems of public hygiene are connected with thatimmense question: the sewers of Paris.</p><p>Paris is the centre of two sheets, a sheet of water and a sheet of air.The sheet of water, lying at a tolerably great depth underground, butalready sounded by two bores, is furnished by the layer of green claysituated between the chalk and the Jurassic lime-stone; this layer may berepresented by a disk five and twenty leagues in circumference; amultitude of rivers and brooks ooze there; one drinks the Seine, theMarne, the Yonne, the Oise, the Aisne, the Cher, the Vienne and the Loirein a glass of water from the well of Grenelle. The sheet of water ishealthy, it comes from heaven in the first place and next from the earth;the sheet of air is unhealthy, it comes from the sewer. All the miasms ofthe cesspool are mingled with the breath of the city; hence this badbreath. The air taken from above a dung-heap, as has been scientificallyproved, is purer than the air taken from above Paris. In a given time,with the aid of progress, mechanisms become perfected, and as lightincreases, the sheet of water will be employed to purify the sheet of air;that is to say, to wash the sewer. The reader knows, that by &ldquo;washing thesewer&rdquo; we mean: the restitution of the filth to the earth; the return tothe soil of dung and of manure to the fields. Through this simple act, theentire social community will experience a diminution of misery and anaugmentation of health. At the present hour, the radiation of diseasesfrom Paris extends to fifty leagues around the Louvre, taken as the hub ofthis pestilential wheel.</p><p>We might say that, for ten centuries, the cesspool has been the diseaseof Paris. The sewer is the blemish which Paris has in her blood. Thepopular instinct has never been deceived in it. The occupation of sewermenwas formerly almost as perilous, and almost as repugnant to the people, asthe occupation of knacker, which was so long held in horror and handedover to the executioner. High wages were necessary to induce a mason todisappear in that fetid mine; the ladder of the cesspool cleanerhesitated to plunge into it; it was said, in proverbial form: &ldquo;to descendinto the sewer is to enter the grave;&rdquo; and all sorts of hideous legends,as we have said, covered this colossal sink with terror; a dread sink-holewhich bears the traces of the revolutions of the globe as of therevolutions of man, and where are to be found vestiges of all cataclysmsfrom the shells of the Deluge to the rag of Marat.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0379" id="link2H_4_0379"></a>BOOK THIRD&mdash;MUD BUT THE SOUL</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0329" id="link2HCH0329"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE SEWER AND ITS SURPRISES</h3><p>It was in the sewers of Paris that Jean Valjean found himself.</p><p>Still another resemblance between Paris and the sea. As in the ocean, thediver may disappear there.</p><p>The transition was an unheard-of one. In the very heart of the city, JeanValjean had escaped from the city, and, in the twinkling of an eye, in thetime required to lift the cover and to replace it, he had passed frombroad daylight to complete obscurity, from midday to midnight, from tumultto silence, from the whirlwind of thunders to the stagnation of the tomb,and, by a vicissitude far more tremendous even than that of the RuePolonceau, from the most extreme peril to the most absolute obscurity.</p><p>An abrupt fall into a cavern; a disappearance into the secret trap-door ofParis; to quit that street where death was on every side, for that sort ofsepulchre where there was life, was a strange instant. He remained forseveral seconds as though bewildered; listening, stupefied. The waste-trapof safety had suddenly yawned beneath him. Celestial goodness had, in amanner, captured him by treachery. Adorable ambuscades of providence!</p><p>Only, the wounded man did not stir, and Jean Valjean did not know whetherthat which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or a deadcorpse.</p><p>His first sensation was one of blindness. All of a sudden, he could seenothing. It seemed to him too, that, in one instant, he had become deaf.He no longer heard anything. The frantic storm of murder which had beenlet loose a few feet above his head did not reach him, thanks to thethickness of the earth which separated him from it, as we have said,otherwise than faintly and indistinctly, and like a rumbling, in thedepths. He felt that the ground was solid under his feet; that was all;but that was enough. He extended one arm and then the other, touched thewalls on both sides, and perceived that the passage was narrow; heslipped, and thus perceived that the pavement was wet. He cautiously putforward one foot, fearing a hole, a sink, some gulf; he discovered thatthe paving continued. A gust of fetidness informed him of the place inwhich he stood.</p><p>After the lapse of a few minutes, he was no longer blind. A little lightfell through the man-hole through which he had descended, and his eyesbecame accustomed to this cavern. He began to distinguish something. Thepassage in which he had burrowed&mdash;no other word can better expressthe situation&mdash;was walled in behind him. It was one of those blindalleys, which the special jargon terms branches. In front of him there wasanother wall, a wall like night. The light of the air-hole died out ten ortwelve paces from the point where Jean Valjean stood, and barely cast awan pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the sewer. Beyond, theopaqueness was massive; to penetrate thither seemed horrible, an entranceinto it appeared like an engulfment. A man could, however, plunge intothat wall of fog and it was necessary so to do. Haste was even requisite.It occurred to Jean Valjean that the grating which he had caught sight ofunder the flag-stones might also catch the eye of the soldiery, and thateverything hung upon this chance. They also might descend into that welland search it. There was not a minute to be lost. He had deposited Mariuson the ground, he picked him up again,&mdash;that is the real word for it,&mdash;placedhim on his shoulders once more, and set out. He plunged resolutely intothe gloom.</p><p>The truth is, that they were less safe than Jean Valjean fancied. Perilsof another sort and no less serious were awaiting them, perchance. Afterthe lightning-charged whirlwind of the combat, the cavern of miasmas andtraps; after chaos, the sewer. Jean Valjean had fallen from one circle ofhell into another.</p><p>When he had advanced fifty paces, he was obliged to halt. A problempresented itself. The passage terminated in another gut which heencountered across his path. There two ways presented themselves. Whichshould he take? Ought he to turn to the left or to the right? How was heto find his bearings in that black labyrinth? This labyrinth, to which wehave already called the reader&rsquo;s attention, has a clue, which is itsslope. To follow to the slope is to arrive at the river.</p><p>This Jean Valjean instantly comprehended.</p><p>He said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des Halles; that ifhe were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope, he wouldarrive, in less than a quarter of an hour, at some mouth on the Seinebetween the Pont au Change and the Pont-Neuf, that is to say, he wouldmake his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spot inParis. Perhaps he would come out on some man-hole at the intersection ofstreets. Amazement of the passers-by at beholding two bleeding men emergefrom the earth at their feet. Arrival of the police, a call to arms of theneighboring post of guards. Thus they would be seized before they had evengot out. It would be better to plunge into that labyrinth, to confidethemselves to that black gloom, and to trust to Providence for theoutcome.</p><p>He ascended the incline, and turned to the right.</p><p>When he had turned the angle of the gallery, the distant glimmer of anair-hole disappeared, the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more,and he became blind again. Nevertheless, he advanced as rapidly aspossible. Marius&rsquo; two arms were passed round his neck, and the former&rsquo;sfeet dragged behind him. He held both these arms with one hand, and gropedalong the wall with the other. Marius&rsquo; cheek touched his, and clung there,bleeding. He felt a warm stream which came from Marius trickling down uponhim and making its way under his clothes. But a humid warmth near his ear,which the mouth of the wounded man touched, indicated respiration, andconsequently, life. The passage along which Jean Valjean was nowproceeding was not so narrow as the first. Jean Valjean walked through itwith considerable difficulty. The rain of the preceding day had not, asyet, entirely run off, and it created a little torrent in the centre ofthe bottom, and he was forced to hug the wall in order not to have hisfeet in the water.</p><p>Thus he proceeded in the gloom. He resembled the beings of the nightgroping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow.</p><p>Still, little by little, whether it was that the distant air-holes emitteda little wavering light in this opaque gloom, or whether his eyes hadbecome accustomed to the obscurity, some vague vision returned to him, andhe began once more to gain a confused idea, now of the wall which hetouched, now of the vault beneath which he was passing. The pupil dilatesin the dark, and the soul dilates in misfortune and ends by finding Godthere.</p><p>It was not easy to direct his course.</p><p>The line of the sewer re-echoes, so to speak, the line of the streetswhich lie above it. There were then in Paris two thousand two hundredstreets. Let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomybranches which is called the sewer. The system of sewers existing at thatepoch, placed end to end, would have given a length of eleven leagues. Wehave said above, that the actual network, thanks to the special activityof the last thirty years, was no less than sixty leagues in extent.</p><p>Jean Valjean began by committing a blunder. He thought that he was beneaththe Rue Saint-Denis, and it was a pity that it was not so. Under the RueSaint-Denis there is an old stone sewer which dates from Louis XIII. andwhich runs straight to the collecting sewer, called the Grand Sewer, withbut a single elbow, on the right, on the elevation of the ancient Cour desMiracles, and a single branch, the Saint-Martin sewer, whose four armsdescribe a cross. But the gut of the Petite-Truanderie the entrance towhich was in the vicinity of the Corinthe wine-shop has never communicatedwith the sewer of the Rue Saint-Denis; it ended at the Montmartre sewer,and it was in this that Jean Valjean was entangled. There opportunities oflosing oneself abound. The Montmartre sewer is one of the mostlabyrinthine of the ancient network. Fortunately, Jean Valjean had leftbehind him the sewer of the markets whose geometrical plan presents theappearance of a multitude of parrots&rsquo; roosts piled on top of each other;but he had before him more than one embarrassing encounter and more thanone street corner&mdash;for they are streets&mdash;presenting itself inthe gloom like an interrogation point; first, on his left, the vast sewerof the Plâtrière, a sort of Chinese puzzle, thrusting out and entanglingits chaos of Ts and Zs under the Post-Office and under the rotunda of theWheat Market, as far as the Seine, where it terminates in a Y; secondly,on his right, the curving corridor of the Rue du Cadran with its threeteeth, which are also blind courts; thirdly, on his left, the branch ofthe Mail, complicated, almost at its inception, with a sort of fork, andproceeding from zig-zag to zig-zag until it ends in the grand crypt of theoutlet of the Louvre, truncated and ramified in every direction; andlastly, the blind alley of a passage of the Rue des Jeûneurs, withoutcounting little ducts here and there, before reaching the belt sewer,which alone could conduct him to some issue sufficiently distant to besafe.</p><p>Had Jean Valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed out, hewould speedily have perceived, merely by feeling the wall, that he was notin the subterranean gallery of the Rue Saint-Denis. Instead of the ancientstone, instead of the antique architecture, haughty and royal even in thesewer, with pavement and string courses of granite and mortar costingeight hundred livres the fathom, he would have felt under his handcontemporary cheapness, economical expedients, porous stone filled withmortar on a concrete foundation, which costs two hundred francs the metre,and the bourgeoise masonry known as <i>à petits matériaux</i>&mdash;small stuff;but of all this he knew nothing.</p><p>He advanced with anxiety, but with calmness, seeing nothing, knowingnothing, buried in chance, that is to say, engulfed in providence.</p><p>By degrees, we will admit, a certain horror seized upon him. The gloomwhich enveloped him penetrated his spirit. He walked in an enigma. Thisaqueduct of the sewer is formidable; it interlaces in a dizzy fashion. Itis a melancholy thing to be caught in this Paris of shadows. Jean Valjeanwas obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing it. Inthis unknown, every step that he risked might be his last. How was he toget out? should he find an issue? should he find it in time? would thatcolossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities, allow itself to bepenetrated and pierced? should he there encounter some unexpected knot inthe darkness? should he arrive at the inextricable and the impassable?would Marius die there of hemorrhage and he of hunger? should they end byboth getting lost, and by furnishing two skeletons in a nook of thatnight? He did not know. He put all these questions to himself withoutreplying to them. The intestines of Paris form a precipice. Like theprophet, he was in the belly of the monster.</p><p>All at once, he had a surprise. At the most unforeseen moment, and withouthaving ceased to walk in a straight line, he perceived that he was nolonger ascending; the water of the rivulet was beating against his heels,instead of meeting him at his toes. The sewer was now descending. Why? Washe about to arrive suddenly at the Seine? This danger was a great one, butthe peril of retreating was still greater. He continued to advance.</p><p>It was not towards the Seine that he was proceeding. The ridge which thesoil of Paris forms on its right bank empties one of its watersheds intothe Seine and the other into the Grand Sewer. The crest of this ridgewhich determines the division of the waters describes a very capriciousline. The culminating point, which is the point of separation of thecurrents, is in the Sainte-Avoye sewer, beyond the Rue Michel-le-Comte, inthe sewer of the Louvre, near the boulevards, and in the Montmartre sewer,near the Halles. It was this culminating point that Jean Valjean hadreached. He was directing his course towards the belt sewer; he was on theright path. But he did not know it.</p><p>Every time that he encountered a branch, he felt of its angles, and if hefound that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the passagein which he was, he did not enter but continued his route, rightly judgingthat every narrower way must needs terminate in a blind alley, and couldonly lead him further from his goal, that is to say, the outlet. Thus heavoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in the darkness by thefour labyrinths which we have just enumerated.</p><p>At a certain moment, he perceived that he was emerging from beneath theParis which was petrified by the uprising, where the barricades hadsuppressed circulation, and that he was entering beneath the living andnormal Paris. Overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder, distantbut continuous. It was the rumbling of vehicles.</p><p>He had been walking for about half an hour, at least according to thecalculation which he made in his own mind, and he had not yet thought ofrest; he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding Marius. Thedarkness was more profound than ever, but its very depth reassured him.</p><p>All at once, he saw his shadow in front of him. It was outlined on afaint, almost indistinct reddish glow, which vaguely empurpled theflooring vault underfoot, and the vault overhead, and gilded to his rightand to his left the two viscous walls of the passage. Stupefied, he turnedround.</p><p>Behind him, in the portion of the passage which he had just passedthrough, at a distance which appeared to him immense, piercing the denseobscurity, flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of surveyinghim.</p><p>It was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer.</p><p>In the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about in aconfused way, black, upright, indistinct, horrible.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0330" id="link2HCH0330"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;EXPLANATION</h3><p>On the day of the sixth of June, a battue of the sewers had been ordered.It was feared that the vanquished might have taken to them for refuge, andPrefect Gisquet was to search occult Paris while General Bugeaud sweptpublic Paris; a double and connected operation which exacted a doublestrategy on the part of the public force, represented above by the armyand below by the police. Three squads of agents and sewermen explored thesubterranean drain of Paris, the first on the right bank, the second onthe left bank, the third in the city. The agents of police were armed withcarabines, with bludgeons, swords and poignards.</p><p>That which was directed at Jean Valjean at that moment, was the lantern ofthe patrol of the right bank.</p><p>This patrol had just visited the curving gallery and the three blindalleys which lie beneath the Rue du Cadran. While they were passing theirlantern through the depths of these blind alleys, Jean Valjean hadencountered on his path the entrance to the gallery, had perceived that itwas narrower than the principal passage and had not penetrated thither. Hehad passed on. The police, on emerging from the gallery du Cadran, hadfancied that they heard the sound of footsteps in the direction of thebelt sewer. They were, in fact, the steps of Jean Valjean. The sergeant incommand of the patrol had raised his lantern, and the squad had begun togaze into the mist in the direction whence the sound proceeded.</p><p>This was an indescribable moment for Jean Valjean.</p><p>Happily, if he saw the lantern well, the lantern saw him but ill. It waslight and he was shadow. He was very far off, and mingled with thedarkness of the place. He hugged the wall and halted. Moreover, he did notunderstand what it was that was moving behind him. The lack of sleep andfood, and his emotions had caused him also to pass into the state of avisionary. He beheld a gleam, and around that gleam, forms. What was it?He did not comprehend.</p><p>Jean Valjean having paused, the sound ceased.</p><p>The men of the patrol listened, and heard nothing, they looked and sawnothing. They held a consultation.</p><p>There existed at that epoch at this point of the Montmartre sewer a sortof crossroads called <i>de service</i>, which was afterwards suppressed, onaccount of the little interior lake which formed there, swallowing up thetorrent of rain in heavy storms. The patrol could form a cluster in thisopen space. Jean Valjean saw these spectres form a sort of circle. Thesebull-dogs&rsquo; heads approached each other closely and whispered together.</p><p>The result of this council held by the watch dogs was, that they had beenmistaken, that there had been no noise, that it was useless to getentangled in the belt sewer, that it would only be a waste of time, butthat they ought to hasten towards Saint-Merry; that if there was anythingto do, and any &ldquo;bousingot&rdquo; to track out, it was in that quarter.</p><p>From time to time, parties re-sole their old insults. In 1832, the wordbousingot formed the interim between the word jacobin, which had becomeobsolete, and the word demagogue which has since rendered such excellentservice.</p><p>The sergeant gave orders to turn to the left, towards the watershed of theSeine.</p><p>If it had occurred to them to separate into two squads, and to go in bothdirections, Jean Valjean would have been captured. All hung on thatthread. It is probable that the instructions of the prefecture, foreseeinga possibility of combat and insurgents in force, had forbidden the patrolto part company. The patrol resumed its march, leaving Jean Valjean behindit. Of all this movement, Jean Valjean perceived nothing, except theeclipse of the lantern which suddenly wheeled round.</p><p>Before taking his departure, the sergeant, in order to acquit hispoliceman&rsquo;s conscience, discharged his gun in the direction of JeanValjean. The detonation rolled from echo to echo in the crypt, like therumbling of that titanic entrail. A bit of plaster which fell into thestream and splashed up the water a few paces away from Jean Valjean,warned him that the ball had struck the arch over his head.</p><p>Slow and measured steps resounded for some time on the timber work,gradually dying away as they retreated to a greater distance; the group ofblack forms vanished, a glimmer of light oscillated and floated,communicating to the vault a reddish glow which grew fainter, thendisappeared; the silence became profound once more, the obscurity becamecomplete, blindness and deafness resumed possession of the shadows; andJean Valjean, not daring to stir as yet, remained for a long time leaningwith his back against the wall, with straining ears, and dilated pupils,watching the disappearance of that phantom patrol.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0331" id="link2HCH0331"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE &ldquo;SPUN&rdquo; MAN</h3><p>This justice must be rendered to the police of that period, that even inthe most serious public junctures, it imperturbably fulfilled its dutiesconnected with the sewers and surveillance. A revolt was, in its eyes, nopretext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own mouths, andfor neglecting society for the reason that the government was in peril.The ordinary service was performed correctly in company with theextraordinary service, and was not troubled by the latter. In the midst ofan incalculable political event already begun, under the pressure of apossible revolution, a police agent, &ldquo;spun&rdquo; a thief without allowinghimself to be distracted by insurrection and barricades.</p><p>It was something precisely parallel which took place on the afternoon ofthe 6th of June on the banks of the Seine, on the slope of the rightshore, a little beyond the Pont des Invalides.</p><p>There is no longer any bank there now. The aspect of the locality haschanged.</p><p>On that bank, two men, separated by a certain distance, seemed to bewatching each other while mutually avoiding each other. The one who was inadvance was trying to get away, the one in the rear was trying to overtakethe other.</p><p>It was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in silence.Neither seemed to be in any hurry, and both walked slowly, as though eachof them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble his pace.</p><p>One would have said that it was an appetite following its prey, andpurposely without wearing the air of doing so. The prey was crafty and onits guard.</p><p>The proper relations between the hunted pole-cat and the hunting dog wereobserved. The one who was seeking to escape had an insignificant mien andnot an impressive appearance; the one who was seeking to seize him wasrude of aspect, and must have been rude to encounter.</p><p>The first, conscious that he was the more feeble, avoided the second; buthe avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious; any one who couldhave observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombre hostility offlight, and all the menace that fear contains.</p><p>The shore was deserted; there were no passers-by; not even a boatman nor alighter-man was in the skiffs which were moored here and there.</p><p>It was not easy to see these two men, except from the quay opposite, andto any person who had scrutinized them at that distance, the man who wasin advance would have appeared like a bristling, tattered, and equivocalbeing, who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse, and the otherlike a classic and official personage, wearing the frock-coat of authoritybuttoned to the chin.</p><p>Perchance the reader might recognize these two men, if he were to see themcloser at hand.</p><p>What was the object of the second man?</p><p>Probably to succeed in clothing the first more warmly.</p><p>When a man clothed by the state pursues a man in rags, it is in order tomake of him a man who is also clothed by the state. Only, the wholequestion lies in the color. To be dressed in blue is glorious; to bedressed in red is disagreeable.</p><p>There is a purple from below.</p><p>It is probably some unpleasantness and some purple of this sort which thefirst man is desirous of shirking.</p><p>If the other allowed him to walk on, and had not seized him as yet, itwas, judging from all appearances, in the hope of seeing him lead up tosome significant meeting-place and to some group worth catching. Thisdelicate operation is called &ldquo;spinning.&rdquo;</p><p>What renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the buttoned-upman, on catching sight from the shore of a hackney-coach on the quay as itwas passing along empty, made a sign to the driver; the driver understood,evidently recognized the person with whom he had to deal, turned about andbegan to follow the two men at the top of the quay, at a foot-pace. Thiswas not observed by the slouching and tattered personage who was inadvance.</p><p>The hackney-coach rolled along the trees of the Champs-Élysées. The bustof the driver, whip in hand, could be seen moving along above the parapet.</p><p>One of the secret instructions of the police authorities to their agentscontains this article: &ldquo;Always have on hand a hackney-coach, in case ofemergency.&rdquo;</p><p>While these two men were manœuvring, each on his own side, withirreproachable strategy, they approached an inclined plane on the quaywhich descended to the shore, and which permitted cab-drivers arrivingfrom Passy to come to the river and water their horses. This inclinedplane was suppressed later on, for the sake of symmetry; horses may die ofthirst, but the eye is gratified.</p><p>It is probable that the man in the blouse had intended to ascend thisinclined plane, with a view to making his escape into the Champs-Élysées,a place ornamented with trees, but, in return, much infested withpolicemen, and where the other could easily exercise violence.</p><p>This point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought toParis from Moret in 1824, by Colonel Brack, and designated as &ldquo;the houseof François I.&rdquo; A guard house is situated close at hand.</p><p>To the great surprise of his watcher, the man who was being tracked didnot mount by the inclined plane for watering. He continued to advancealong the quay on the shore.</p><p>His position was visibly becoming critical.</p><p>What was he intending to do, if not to throw himself into the Seine?</p><p>Henceforth, there existed no means of ascending to the quay; there was noother inclined plane, no staircase; and they were near the spot, marked bythe bend in the Seine towards the Pont de Jéna, where the bank, growingconstantly narrower, ended in a slender tongue, and was lost in the water.There he would inevitably find himself blocked between the perpendicularwall on his right, the river on his left and in front of him, and theauthorities on his heels.</p><p>It is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from sight by aheap of rubbish six or seven feet in height, produced by some demolitionor other. But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind thatheap of rubbish, which one need but skirt? The expedient would have beenpuerile. He certainly was not dreaming of such a thing. The innocence ofthieves does not extend to that point.</p><p>The pile of rubbish formed a sort of projection at the water&rsquo;s edge, whichwas prolonged in a promontory as far as the wall of the quay.</p><p>The man who was being followed arrived at this little mound and went roundit, so that he ceased to be seen by the other.</p><p>The latter, as he did not see, could not be seen; he took advantage ofthis fact to abandon all dissimulation and to walk very rapidly. In a fewmoments, he had reached the rubbish heap and passed round it. There hehalted in sheer amazement. The man whom he had been pursuing was no longerthere.</p><p>Total eclipse of the man in the blouse.</p><p>The shore, beginning with the rubbish heap, was only about thirty paceslong, then it plunged into the water which beat against the wall of thequay. The fugitive could not have thrown himself into the Seine withoutbeing seen by the man who was following him. What had become of him?</p><p>The man in the buttoned-up coat walked to the extremity of the shore, andremained there in thought for a moment, his fists clenched, his eyessearching. All at once he smote his brow. He had just perceived, at thepoint where the land came to an end and the water began, a large irongrating, low, arched, garnished with a heavy lock and with three massivehinges. This grating, a sort of door pierced at the base of the quay,opened on the river as well as on the shore. A blackish stream passedunder it. This stream discharged into the Seine.</p><p>Beyond the heavy, rusty iron bars, a sort of dark and vaulted corridorcould be descried. The man folded his arms and stared at the grating withan air of reproach.</p><p>As this gaze did not suffice, he tried to thrust it aside; he shook it, itresisted solidly. It is probable that it had just been opened, although nosound had been heard, a singular circumstance in so rusty a grating; butit is certain that it had been closed again. This indicated that the manbefore whom that door had just opened had not a hook but a key.</p><p>This evidence suddenly burst upon the mind of the man who was trying tomove the grating, and evoked from him this indignant ejaculation:</p><p>&ldquo;That is too much! A government key!&rdquo;</p><p>Then, immediately regaining his composure, he expressed a whole world ofinterior ideas by this outburst of monosyllables accented almostironically: &ldquo;Come! Come! Come! Come!&rdquo;</p><p>That said, and in the hope of something or other, either that he shouldsee the man emerge or other men enter, he posted himself on the watchbehind a heap of rubbish, with the patient rage of a pointer.</p><p>The hackney-coach, which regulated all its movements on his, had, in itsturn, halted on the quay above him, close to the parapet. The coachman,foreseeing a prolonged wait, encased his horses&rsquo; muzzles in the bag ofoats which is damp at the bottom, and which is so familiar to Parisians,to whom, be it said in parenthesis, the Government sometimes applies it.The rare passers-by on the Pont de Jéna turned their heads, before theypursued their way, to take a momentary glance at these two motionlessitems in the landscape, the man on the shore, the carriage on the quay.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0332" id="link2HCH0332"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;HE ALSO BEARS HIS CROSS</h3><p>Jean Valjean had resumed his march and had not again paused.</p><p>This march became more and more laborious. The level of these vaultsvaries; the average height is about five feet, six inches, and has beencalculated for the stature of a man; Jean Valjean was forced to bend over,in order not to strike Marius against the vault; at every step he had tobend, then to rise, and to feel incessantly of the wall. The moisture ofthe stones, and the viscous nature of the timber framework furnished butpoor supports to which to cling, either for hand or foot. He stumbledalong in the hideous dung-heap of the city. The intermittent gleams fromthe air-holes only appeared at very long intervals, and were so wan thatthe full sunlight seemed like the light of the moon; all the rest wasmist, miasma, opaqueness, blackness. Jean Valjean was both hungry andthirsty; especially thirsty; and this, like the sea, was a place full ofwater where a man cannot drink. His strength, which was prodigious, as thereader knows, and which had been but little decreased by age, thanks tohis chaste and sober life, began to give way, nevertheless. Fatigue beganto gain on him; and as his strength decreased, it made the weight of hisburden increase. Marius, who was, perhaps, dead, weighed him down as inertbodies weigh. Jean Valjean held him in such a manner that his chest wasnot oppressed, and so that respiration could proceed as well as possible.Between his legs he felt the rapid gliding of the rats. One of them wasfrightened to such a degree that he bit him. From time to time, a breathof fresh air reached him through the vent-holes of the mouths of thesewer, and reanimated him.</p><p>It might have been three hours past midday when he reached the belt-sewer.</p><p>He was, at first, astonished at this sudden widening. He found himself,all at once, in a gallery where his outstretched hands could not reach thetwo walls, and beneath a vault which his head did not touch. The GrandSewer is, in fact, eight feet wide and seven feet high.</p><p>At the point where the Montmartre sewer joins the Grand Sewer, two othersubterranean galleries, that of the Rue de Provence, and that of theAbattoir, form a square. Between these four ways, a less sagacious manwould have remained undecided. Jean Valjean selected the broadest, that isto say, the belt-sewer. But here the question again came up&mdash;shouldhe descend or ascend? He thought that the situation required haste, andthat he must now gain the Seine at any risk. In other terms, he mustdescend. He turned to the left.</p><p>It was well that he did so, for it is an error to suppose that thebelt-sewer has two outlets, the one in the direction of Bercy, the othertowards Passy, and that it is, as its name indicates, the subterraneangirdle of the Paris on the right bank. The Grand Sewer, which is, it mustbe remembered, nothing else than the old brook of Ménilmontant,terminates, if one ascends it, in a blind sack, that is to say, at itsancient point of departure which was its source, at the foot of the knollof Ménilmontant. There is no direct communication with the branch whichcollects the waters of Paris beginning with the Quartier Popincourt, andwhich falls into the Seine through the Amelot sewer above the ancient IsleLouviers. This branch, which completes the collecting sewer, is separatedfrom it, under the Rue Ménilmontant itself, by a pile which marks thedividing point of the waters, between upstream and downstream. If JeanValjean had ascended the gallery he would have arrived, after a thousandefforts, and broken down with fatigue, and in an expiring condition, inthe gloom, at a wall. He would have been lost.</p><p>In case of necessity, by retracing his steps a little way, and enteringthe passage of the Filles-du-Calvaire, on condition that he did nothesitate at the subterranean crossing of the Carrefour Boucherat, and bytaking the corridor Saint-Louis, then the Saint-Gilles gut on the left,then turning to the right and avoiding the Saint-Sebastian gallery, hemight have reached the Amelot sewer, and thence, provided that he did notgo astray in the sort of F which lies under the Bastille, he might haveattained the outlet on the Seine near the Arsenal. But in order to dothis, he must have been thoroughly familiar with the enormous madrepore ofthe sewer in all its ramifications and in all its openings. Now, we mustagain insist that he knew nothing of that frightful drain which he wastraversing; and had any one asked him in what he was, he would haveanswered: &ldquo;In the night.&rdquo;</p><p>His instinct served him well. To descend was, in fact, possible safety.</p><p>He left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in the formof a claw under the Rue Laffitte and the Rue Saint-Georges and the long,bifurcated corridor of the Chaussée d&rsquo;Antin.</p><p>A little beyond an affluent, which was, probably, the Madeleine branch, hehalted. He was extremely weary. A passably large air-hole, probably theman-hole in the Rue d&rsquo;Anjou, furnished a light that was almost vivid. JeanValjean, with the gentleness of movement which a brother would exercisetowards his wounded brother, deposited Marius on the banquette of thesewer. Marius&rsquo; blood-stained face appeared under the wan light of theair-hole like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb. His eyes were closed, hishair was plastered down on his temples like a painter&rsquo;s brushes dried inred wash; his hands hung limp and dead. A clot of blood had collected inthe knot of his cravat; his limbs were cold, and blood was clotted at thecorners of his mouth; his shirt had thrust itself into his wounds, thecloth of his coat was chafing the yawning gashes in the living flesh. JeanValjean, pushing aside the garments with the tips of his fingers, laid hishand upon Marius&rsquo; breast; his heart was still beating. Jean Valjean toreup his shirt, bandaged the young man&rsquo;s wounds as well as he was able andstopped the flowing blood; then bending over Marius, who still layunconscious and almost without breathing, in that half light, he gazed athim with inexpressible hatred.</p><p>On disarranging Marius&rsquo; garments, he had found two things in his pockets,the roll which had been forgotten there on the preceding evening, andMarius&rsquo; pocketbook. He ate the roll and opened the pocketbook. On thefirst page he found the four lines written by Marius. The reader willrecall them:</p><p>&ldquo;My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my body to my grandfather, M.Gillenormand, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean read these four lines by the light of the air-hole, andremained for a moment as though absorbed in thought, repeating in a lowtone: &ldquo;Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, number 6, Monsieur Gillenormand.&rdquo; Hereplaced the pocketbook in Marius&rsquo; pocket. He had eaten, his strength hadreturned to him; he took Marius up once more upon his back, placed thelatter&rsquo;s head carefully on his right shoulder, and resumed his descent ofthe sewer.</p><p>The Grand Sewer, directed according to the course of the valley ofMénilmontant, is about two leagues long. It is paved throughout a notableportion of its extent.</p><p>This torch of the names of the streets of Paris, with which we areilluminating for the reader Jean Valjean&rsquo;s subterranean march, JeanValjean himself did not possess. Nothing told him what zone of the city hewas traversing, nor what way he had made. Only the growing pallor of thepools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to himthat the sun was withdrawing from the pavement, and that the day wouldsoon be over; and the rolling of vehicles overhead, having becomeintermittent instead of continuous, then having almost ceased, heconcluded that he was no longer under central Paris, and that he wasapproaching some solitary region, in the vicinity of the outer boulevards,or the extreme outer quays. Where there are fewer houses and streets, thesewer has fewer air-holes. The gloom deepened around Jean Valjean.Nevertheless, he continued to advance, groping his way in the dark.</p><p>Suddenly this darkness became terrible.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0333" id="link2HCH0333"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;IN THE CASE OF SAND AS IN THAT OF WOMAN, THERE IS AFINENESS WHICH IS TREACHEROUS</h3><p>He felt that he was entering the water, and that he no longer had apavement under his feet, but only mud.</p><p>It sometimes happens, that on certain shores of Bretagne or Scotland aman, either a traveller or a fisherman, while walking at low tide on thebeach far from shore, suddenly notices that for several minutes past, hehas been walking with some difficulty. The beach under foot is like pitch;his soles stick fast to it; it is no longer sand, it is bird-lime. Thestrand is perfectly dry, but at every step that he takes, as soon as thefoot is raised, the print is filled with water. The eye, however, hasperceived no change; the immense beach is smooth and tranquil, all thesand has the same aspect, nothing distinguishes the soil that is solidfrom that which is not solid; the joyous little cloud of sand-licecontinues to leap tumultuously under the feet of the passer-by.</p><p>The man pursues his way, he walks on, turns towards the land, endeavors toapproach the shore. He is not uneasy. Uneasy about what? Only he isconscious that the heaviness of his feet seems to be increasing at everystep that he takes. All at once he sinks in. He sinks in two or threeinches. Decidedly, he is not on the right road; he halts to get hisbearings. Suddenly he glances at his feet; his feet have disappeared. Thesand has covered them.

Thesand is up to his ankles, he tears himself free from it and flings himselfto the left, the sand reaches to mid-leg, he flings himself to the right,the sand comes up to his knees. Then, with indescribable terror, herecognizes the fact that he is caught in a quicksand, and that he hasbeneath him that frightful medium in which neither man can walk nor fishcan swim. He flings away his burden, if he have one, he lightens himself,like a ship in distress; it is too late, the sand is above his knees.</p><p>He shouts, he waves his hat, or his handkerchief, the sand continuallygains on him; if the beach is deserted, if the land is too far away, ifthe bank of sand is too ill-famed, there is no hero in the neighborhood,all is over, he is condemned to be engulfed. He is condemned to thatterrible interment, long, infallible, implacable, which it is impossibleto either retard or hasten, which lasts for hours, which will not come toan end, which seizes you erect, free, in the flush of health, which dragsyou down by the feet, which, at every effort that you attempt, at everyshout that you utter, draws you a little lower, which has the air ofpunishing you for your resistance by a redoubled grasp, which forces a manto return slowly to earth, while leaving him time to survey the horizon,the trees, the verdant country, the smoke of the villages on the plain,the sails of the ships on the sea, the birds which fly and sing, the sunand the sky. This engulfment is the sepulchre which assumes a tide, andwhich mounts from the depths of the earth towards a living man. Eachminute is an inexorable layer-out of the dead. The wretched man tries tosit down, to lie down, to climb; every movement that he makes buries himdeeper; he straightens himself up, he sinks; he feels that he is beingswallowed up; he shrieks, implores, cries to the clouds, wrings his hands,grows desperate. Behold him in the sand up to his belly, the sand reachesto his breast, he is only a bust now. He uplifts his hands, utters furiousgroans, clenches his nails on the beach, tries to cling fast to thatashes, supports himself on his elbows in order to raise himself from thatsoft sheath, and sobs frantically; the sand mounts higher. The sand hasreached his shoulders, the sand reaches to his throat; only his face isvisible now. His mouth cries aloud, the sand fills it; silence. His eyesstill gaze forth, the sand closes them, night. Then his brow decreases, alittle hair quivers above the sand; a hand projects, pierces the surfaceof the beach, waves and disappears. Sinister obliteration of a man.</p><p>Sometimes a rider is engulfed with his horse; sometimes the carter isswallowed up with his cart; all founders in that strand. It is shipwreckelsewhere than in the water. It is the earth drowning a man. The earth,permeated with the ocean, becomes a pitfall. It presents itself in theguise of a plain, and it yawns like a wave. The abyss is subject to thesetreacheries.</p><p>This melancholy fate, always possible on certain sea beaches, was alsopossible, thirty years ago, in the sewers of Paris.</p><p>Before the important works, undertaken in 1833, the subterranean drain ofParis was subject to these sudden slides.</p><p>The water filtered into certain subjacent strata, which were particularlyfriable; the foot-way, which was of flag-stones, as in the ancient sewers,or of cement on concrete, as in the new galleries, having no longer anunderpinning, gave way. A fold in a flooring of this sort means a crack,means crumbling. The framework crumbled away for a certain length. Thiscrevice, the hiatus of a gulf of mire, was called a <i>fontis</i>, in the specialtongue. What is a <i>fontis?</i> It is the quicksands of the seashore suddenlyencountered under the surface of the earth; it is the beach of MontSaint-Michel in a sewer. The soaked soil is in a state of fusion, as itwere; all its molecules are in suspension in soft medium; it is not earthand it is not water. The depth is sometimes very great. Nothing can bemore formidable than such an encounter. If the water predominates, deathis prompt, the man is swallowed up; if earth predominates, death is slow.</p><p>Can any one picture to himself such a death? If being swallowed by theearth is terrible on the seashore, what is it in a cesspool? Instead ofthe open air, the broad daylight, the clear horizon, those vast sounds,those free clouds whence rains life, instead of those barks descried inthe distance, of that hope under all sorts of forms, of probablepassers-by, of succor possible up to the very last moment,&mdash;insteadof all this, deafness, blindness, a black vault, the inside of a tombalready prepared, death in the mire beneath a cover! slow suffocation byfilth, a stone box where asphyxia opens its claw in the mire and clutchesyou by the throat; fetidness mingled with the death-rattle; slime insteadof the strand, sulfuretted hydrogen in place of the hurricane, dung inplace of the ocean! And to shout, to gnash one&rsquo;s teeth, and to writhe, andto struggle, and to agonize, with that enormous city which knows nothingof it all, over one&rsquo;s head!</p><p>Inexpressible is the horror of dying thus! Death sometimes redeems hisatrocity by a certain terrible dignity. On the funeral pile, in shipwreck,one can be great; in the flames as in the foam, a superb attitude ispossible; one there becomes transfigured as one perishes. But not here.Death is filthy. It is humiliating to expire. The supreme floating visionsare abject. Mud is synonymous with shame. It is petty, ugly, infamous. Todie in a butt of Malvoisie, like Clarence, is permissible; in the ditch ofa scavenger, like Escoubleau, is horrible. To struggle therein is hideous;at the same time that one is going through the death agony, one isfloundering about. There are shadows enough for hell, and mire enough torender it nothing but a slough, and the dying man knows not whether he ison the point of becoming a spectre or a frog.</p><p>Everywhere else the sepulchre is sinister; here it is deformed.</p><p>The depth of the <i>fontis</i> varied, as well as their length and their density,according to the more or less bad quality of the sub-soil. Sometimes a<i>fontis</i> was three or four feet deep, sometimes eight or ten; sometimes thebottom was unfathomable. Here the mire was almost solid, there almostliquid. In the Lunière fontis, it would have taken a man a day todisappear, while he would have been devoured in five minutes by thePhilippeaux slough. The mire bears up more or less, according to itsdensity. A child can escape where a man will perish. The first law ofsafety is to get rid of every sort of load. Every sewerman who felt theground giving way beneath him began by flinging away his sack of tools, orhis back-basket, or his hod.</p><p>The fontis were due to different causes: the friability of the soil; somelandslip at a depth beyond the reach of man; the violent summer rains; theincessant flooding of winter; long, drizzling showers. Sometimes theweight of the surrounding houses on a marly or sandy soil forced out thevaults of the subterranean galleries and caused them to bend aside, or itchanced that a flooring vault burst and split under this crushing thrust.In this manner, the heaping up of the Parthénon, obliterated, a centuryago, a portion of the vaults of Saint-Geneviève hill. When a sewer wasbroken in under the pressure of the houses, the mischief was sometimesbetrayed in the street above by a sort of space, like the teeth of a saw,between the paving-stones; this crevice was developed in an undulatingline throughout the entire length of the cracked vault, and then, the evilbeing visible, the remedy could be promptly applied. It also frequentlyhappened, that the interior ravages were not revealed by any externalscar, and in that case, woe to the sewermen. When they entered withoutprecaution into the sewer, they were liable to be lost. Ancient registersmake mention of several scavengers who were buried in fontis in thismanner. They give many names; among others, that of the sewerman who wasswallowed up in a quagmire under the man-hole of the Rue Carême-Prenant, acertain Blaise Poutrain; this Blaise Poutrain was the brother of NicholasPoutrain, who was the last grave-digger of the cemetery called theCharnier des Innocents, in 1785, the epoch when that cemetery expired.</p><p>There was also that young and charming Vicomte d&rsquo;Escoubleau, of whom wehave just spoken, one of the heroes of the siege of Lérida, where theydelivered the assault in silk stockings, with violins at their head.D&rsquo;Escoubleau, surprised one night at his cousin&rsquo;s, the Duchesse deSourdis&rsquo;, was drowned in a quagmire of the Beautreillis sewer, in which hehad taken refuge in order to escape from the Duke. Madame de Sourdis, wheninformed of his death, demanded her smelling-bottle, and forgot to weep,through sniffling at her salts. In such cases, there is no love whichholds fast; the sewer extinguishes it. Hero refuses to wash the body ofLeander. Thisbe stops her nose in the presence of Pyramus and says:&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0334" id="link2HCH0334"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE FONTIS</h3><p>Jean Valjean found himself in the presence of a fontis.</p><p>This sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of theChamps-Élysées, difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and a badpreservative of the subterranean constructions, on account of itsexcessive fluidity. This fluidity exceeds even the inconsistency of thesands of the Quartier Saint-Georges, which could only be conquered by astone construction on a concrete foundation, and the clayey strata,infected with gas, of the Quartier des Martyrs, which are so liquid thatthe only way in which a passage was effected under the gallery des Martyrswas by means of a cast-iron pipe. When, in 1836, the old stone sewerbeneath the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, in which we now see Jean Valjean, wasdemolished for the purpose of reconstructing it, the quicksand, whichforms the subsoil of the Champs-Élysées as far as the Seine, presentedsuch an obstacle, that the operation lasted nearly six months, to thegreat clamor of the dwellers on the riverside, particularly those who hadhotels and carriages. The work was more than unhealthy; it was dangerous.It is true that they had four months and a half of rain, and three floodsof the Seine.</p><p>The fontis which Jean Valjean had encountered was caused by the downpourof the preceding day. The pavement, badly sustained by the subjacent sand,had given way and had produced a stoppage of the water. Infiltration hadtaken place, a slip had followed. The dislocated bottom had sunk into theooze. To what extent? Impossible to say. The obscurity was more densethere than elsewhere. It was a pit of mire in a cavern of night.</p><p>Jean Valjean felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet. He entered thisslime. There was water on the surface, slime at the bottom. He must passit. To retrace his steps was impossible. Marius was dying, and JeanValjean exhausted. Besides, where was he to go? Jean Valjean advanced.Moreover, the pit seemed, for the first few steps, not to be very deep.But in proportion as he advanced, his feet plunged deeper. Soon he had theslime up to his calves and water above his knees. He walked on, raisingMarius in his arms, as far above the water as he could. The mire nowreached to his knees, and the water to his waist. He could no longerretreat. This mud, dense enough for one man, could not, obviously, upholdtwo. Marius and Jean Valjean would have stood a chance of extricatingthemselves singly. Jean Valjean continued to advance, supporting the dyingman, who was, perhaps, a corpse.</p><p>The water came up to his arm-pits; he felt that he was sinking; it wasonly with difficulty that he could move in the depth of ooze which he hadnow reached. The density, which was his support, was also an obstacle. Hestill held Marius on high, and with an unheard-of expenditure of force, headvanced still; but he was sinking. He had only his head above the waternow and his two arms holding up Marius. In the old paintings of the delugethere is a mother holding her child thus.</p><p>He sank still deeper, he turned his face to the rear, to escape the water,and in order that he might be able to breathe; anyone who had seen him inthat gloom would have thought that what he beheld was a mask floating onthe shadows; he caught a faint glimpse above him of the drooping head andlivid face of Marius; he made a desperate effort and launched his footforward; his foot struck something solid; a point of support. It was hightime.</p><p>He straightened himself up, and rooted himself upon that point of supportwith a sort of fury. This produced upon him the effect of the first stepin a staircase leading back to life.</p><p>The point of support, thus encountered in the mire at the supreme moment,was the beginning of the other watershed of the pavement, which had bentbut had not given way, and which had curved under the water like a plankand in a single piece. Well built pavements form a vault and possess thissort of firmness. This fragment of the vaulting, partly submerged, butsolid, was a veritable inclined plane, and, once on this plane, he wassafe. Jean Valjean mounted this inclined plane and reached the other sideof the quagmire.</p><p>As he emerged from the water, he came in contact with a stone and fellupon his knees. He reflected that this was but just, and he remained therefor some time, with his soul absorbed in words addressed to God.</p><p>He rose to his feet, shivering, chilled, foul-smelling, bowed beneath thedying man whom he was dragging after him, all dripping with slime, and hissoul filled with a strange light.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0335" id="link2HCH0335"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;ONE SOMETIMES RUNS AGROUND WHEN ONE FANCIES THAT ONE ISDISEMBARKING</h3><p>He set out on his way once more.</p><p>However, although he had not left his life in the fontis, he seemed tohave left his strength behind him there. That supreme effort had exhaustedhim. His lassitude was now such that he was obliged to pause for breathevery three or four steps, and lean against the wall. Once he was forcedto seat himself on the banquette in order to alter Marius&rsquo; position, andhe thought that he should have to remain there. But if his vigor was dead,his energy was not. He rose again.</p><p>He walked on desperately, almost fast, proceeded thus for a hundred paces,almost without drawing breath, and suddenly came in contact with the wall.He had reached an elbow of the sewer, and, arriving at the turn with headbent down, he had struck the wall. He raised his eyes, and at theextremity of the vault, far, very far away in front of him, he perceived alight. This time it was not that terrible light; it was good, white light.It was daylight. Jean Valjean saw the outlet.</p><p>A damned soul, who, in the midst of the furnace, should suddenly perceivethe outlet of Gehenna, would experience what Jean Valjean felt. It wouldfly wildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards that radiantportal. Jean Valjean was no longer conscious of fatigue, he no longer feltMarius&rsquo; weight, he found his legs once more of steel, he ran rather thanwalked. As he approached, the outlet became more and more distinctlydefined. It was a pointed arch, lower than the vault, which graduallynarrowed, and narrower than the gallery, which closed in as the vault grewlower. The tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel; a faultyconstruction, imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries, logical in aprison, illogical in a sewer, and which has since been corrected.</p><p>Jean Valjean reached the outlet.</p><p>There he halted.</p><p>It certainly was the outlet, but he could not get out.</p><p>The arch was closed by a heavy grating, and the grating, which, to allappearance, rarely swung on its rusty hinges, was clamped to its stonejamb by a thick lock, which, red with rust, seemed like an enormous brick.The keyhole could be seen, and the robust latch, deeply sunk in the ironstaple. The door was plainly double-locked. It was one of those prisonlocks which old Paris was so fond of lavishing.</p><p>Beyond the grating was the open air, the river, the daylight, the shore,very narrow but sufficient for escape. The distant quays, Paris, that gulfin which one so easily hides oneself, the broad horizon, liberty. On theright, downstream, the bridge of Jéna was discernible, on the left,upstream, the bridge of the Invalides; the place would have been apropitious one in which to await the night and to escape. It was one ofthe most solitary points in Paris; the shore which faces theGrand-Caillou. Flies were entering and emerging through the bars of thegrating.</p><p>It might have been half-past eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening. The day wasdeclining.</p><p>Jean Valjean laid Marius down along the wall, on the dry portion of thevaulting, then he went to the grating and clenched both fists round thebars; the shock which he gave it was frenzied, but it did not move. Thegrating did not stir. Jean Valjean seized the bars one after the other, inthe hope that he might be able to tear away the least solid, and to makeof it a lever wherewith to raise the door or to break the lock. Not a barstirred. The teeth of a tiger are not more firmly fixed in their sockets.No lever; no prying possible. The obstacle was invincible. There was nomeans of opening the gate.</p><p>Must he then stop there? What was he to do? What was to become of him? Hehad not the strength to retrace his steps, to recommence the journey whichhe had already taken. Besides, how was he to again traverse that quagmirewhence he had only extricated himself as by a miracle? And after thequagmire, was there not the police patrol, which assuredly could not betwice avoided? And then, whither was he to go? What direction should hepursue? To follow the incline would not conduct him to his goal. If hewere to reach another outlet, he would find it obstructed by a plug or agrating. Every outlet was, undoubtedly, closed in that manner. Chance hadunsealed the grating through which he had entered, but it was evident thatall the other sewer mouths were barred. He had only succeeded in escapinginto a prison.</p><p>All was over. Everything that Jean Valjean had done was useless.Exhaustion had ended in failure.</p><p>They were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death, and JeanValjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands andquivering in the shadows. He turned his back to the grating, and fell uponthe pavement, hurled to earth rather than seated, close to Marius, whostill made no movement, and with his head bent between his knees. This wasthe last drop of anguish.</p><p>Of what was he thinking during this profound depression? Neither ofhimself nor of Marius. He was thinking of Cosette.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0336" id="link2HCH0336"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE TORN COAT-TAIL</h3><p>In the midst of this prostration, a hand was laid on his shoulder, and alow voice said to him:</p><p>&ldquo;Half shares.&rdquo;</p><p>Some person in that gloom? Nothing so closely resembles a dream asdespair. Jean Valjean thought that he was dreaming. He had heard nofootsteps. Was it possible? He raised his eyes.</p><p>A man stood before him.</p><p>This man was clad in a blouse; his feet were bare; he held his shoes inhis left hand; he had evidently removed them in order to reach JeanValjean, without allowing his steps to be heard.</p><p>Jean Valjean did not hesitate for an instant. Unexpected as was thisencounter, this man was known to him. The man was Thénardier.</p><p>Although awakened, so to speak, with a start, Jean Valjean, accustomed toalarms, and steeled to unforeseen shocks that must be promptly parried,instantly regained possession of his presence of mind. Moreover, thesituation could not be made worse, a certain degree of distress is nolonger capable of a crescendo, and Thénardier himself could add nothing tothis blackness of this night.</p><p>A momentary pause ensued.</p><p>Thénardier, raising his right hand to a level with his forehead, formedwith it a shade, then he brought his eyelashes together, by screwing uphis eyes, a motion which, in connection with a slight contraction of themouth, characterizes the sagacious attention of a man who is endeavoringto recognize another man. He did not succeed. Jean Valjean, as we havejust stated, had his back turned to the light, and he was, moreover, sodisfigured, so bemired, so bleeding that he would have been unrecognizablein full noonday. On the contrary, illuminated by the light from thegrating, a cellar light, it is true, livid, yet precise in its lividness,Thénardier, as the energetic popular metaphor expresses it, immediately&ldquo;leaped into&rdquo; Jean Valjean&rsquo;s eyes. This inequality of conditions sufficedto assure some advantage to Jean Valjean in that mysterious duel which wason the point of beginning between the two situations and the two men. Theencounter took place between Jean Valjean veiled and Thénardier unmasked.</p><p>Jean Valjean immediately perceived that Thénardier did not recognize him.</p><p>They surveyed each other for a moment in that half-gloom, as though takingeach other&rsquo;s measure. Thénardier was the first to break the silence.</p><p>&ldquo;How are you going to manage to get out?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean made no reply. Thénardier continued:</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to pick the lock of that gate. But still you must get outof this.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, half shares then.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have killed that man; that&rsquo;s all right. I have the key.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier pointed to Marius. He went on:</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you, but I want to help you. You must be a friend.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean began to comprehend. Thénardier took him for an assassin.</p><p>Thénardier resumed:</p><p>&ldquo;Listen, comrade. You didn&rsquo;t kill that man without looking to see what hehad in his pockets. Give me my half. I&rsquo;ll open the door for you.&rdquo;</p><p>And half drawing from beneath his tattered blouse a huge key, he added:</p><p>&ldquo;Do you want to see how a key to liberty is made? Look here.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean &ldquo;remained stupid&rdquo;&mdash;the expression belongs to the elderCorneille&mdash;to such a degree that he doubted whether what he beheldwas real. It was Providence appearing in horrible guise, and his goodangel springing from the earth in the form of Thénardier.</p><p>Thénardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his blouse,drew out a rope and offered it to Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the rope to boot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is the rope for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You will need a stone also, but you can find one outside. There&rsquo;s a heapof rubbish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What am I to do with a stone?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Idiot, you&rsquo;ll want to sling that stiff into the river, you&rsquo;ll need astone and a rope, otherwise it would float on the water.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean took the rope. There is no one who does not occasionallyaccept in this mechanical way.</p><p>Thénardier snapped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly occurred tohim.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, see here, comrade, how did you contrive to get out of that sloughyonder? I haven&rsquo;t dared to risk myself in it. Phew! you don&rsquo;t smell good.&rdquo;</p><p>After a pause he added:</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking you questions, but you&rsquo;re perfectly right not to answer. It&rsquo;san apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before theexamining magistrate. And then, when you don&rsquo;t talk at all, you run norisk of talking too loud. That&rsquo;s no matter, as I can&rsquo;t see your face andas I don&rsquo;t know your name, you are wrong in supposing that I don&rsquo;t knowwho you are and what you want. I twig. You&rsquo;ve broken up that gentleman abit; now you want to tuck him away somewhere. The river, that great hiderof folly, is what you want. I&rsquo;ll get you out of your scrape. Helping agood fellow in a pinch is what suits me to a hair.&rdquo;</p><p>While expressing his approval of Jean Valjean&rsquo;s silence, he endeavored toforce him to talk. He jostled his shoulder in an attempt to catch a sightof his profile, and he exclaimed, without, however, raising his tone:</p><p>&ldquo;Apropos of that quagmire, you&rsquo;re a hearty animal. Why didn&rsquo;t you toss theman in there?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean preserved silence.</p><p>Thénardier resumed, pushing the rag which served him as a cravat to thelevel of his Adam&rsquo;s apple, a gesture which completes the capable air of aserious man:</p><p>&ldquo;After all, you acted wisely. The workmen, when they come to-morrow tostop up that hole, would certainly have found the stiff abandoned there,and it might have been possible, thread by thread, straw by straw, to pickup the scent and reach you. Some one has passed through the sewer. Who?Where did he get out? Was he seen to come out? The police are full ofcleverness. The sewer is treacherous and tells tales of you. Such a findis a rarity, it attracts attention, very few people make use of the sewersfor their affairs, while the river belongs to everybody. The river is thetrue grave. At the end of a month they fish up your man in the nets atSaint-Cloud. Well, what does one care for that? It&rsquo;s carrion! Who killedthat man? Paris. And justice makes no inquiries. You have done well.&rdquo;</p><p>The more loquacious Thénardier became, the more mute was Jean Valjean.</p><p>Again Thénardier shook him by the shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s settle this business. Let&rsquo;s go shares. You have seen my key,show me your money.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier was haggard, fierce, suspicious, rather menacing, yet amicable.</p><p>There was one singular circumstance; Thénardier&rsquo;s manners were not simple;he had not the air of being wholly at his ease; while affecting an air ofmystery, he spoke low; from time to time he laid his finger on his mouth,and muttered, &ldquo;hush!&rdquo; It was difficult to divine why. There was no onethere except themselves. Jean Valjean thought that other ruffians mightpossibly be concealed in some nook, not very far off, and that Thénardierdid not care to share with them.</p><p>Thénardier resumed:</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s settle up. How much did the stiff have in his bags?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean searched his pockets.</p><p>It was his habit, as the reader will remember, to always have some moneyabout him. The mournful life of expedients to which he had been condemnedimposed this as a law upon him. On this occasion, however, he had beencaught unprepared. When donning his uniform of a National Guardsman on thepreceding evening, he had forgotten, dolefully absorbed as he was, to takehis pocket-book. He had only some small change in his fob. He turned outhis pocket, all soaked with ooze, and spread out on the banquette of thevault one louis d&rsquo;or, two five-franc pieces, and five or six large sous.</p><p>Thénardier thrust out his lower lip with a significant twist of the neck.</p><p>&ldquo;You knocked him over cheap,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>He set to feeling the pockets of Jean Valjean and Marius, with thegreatest familiarity. Jean Valjean, who was chiefly concerned in keepinghis back to the light, let him have his way.</p><p>While handling Marius&rsquo; coat, Thénardier, with the skill of a pickpocket,and without being noticed by Jean Valjean, tore off a strip which heconcealed under his blouse, probably thinking that this morsel of stuffmight serve, later on, to identify the assassinated man and the assassin.However, he found no more than the thirty francs.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;both of you together have no more than that.&rdquo;</p><p>And, forgetting his motto: &ldquo;half shares,&rdquo; he took all.</p><p>He hesitated a little over the large sous. After due reflection, he tookthem also, muttering:</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind! You cut folks&rsquo; throats too cheap altogether.&rdquo;</p><p>That done, he once more drew the big key from under his blouse.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, my friend, you must leave. It&rsquo;s like the fair here, you pay when yougo out. You have paid, now clear out.&rdquo;</p><p>And he began to laugh.</p><p>Had he, in lending to this stranger the aid of his key, and in making someother man than himself emerge from that portal, the pure and disinterestedintention of rescuing an assassin? We may be permitted to doubt this.</p><p>Thénardier helped Jean Valjean to replace Marius on his shoulders, then hebetook himself to the grating on tiptoe, and barefooted, making JeanValjean a sign to follow him, looked out, laid his finger on his mouth,and remained for several seconds, as though in suspense; his inspectionfinished, he placed the key in the lock. The bolt slipped back and thegate swung open. It neither grated nor squeaked. It moved very softly.</p><p>It was obvious that this gate and those hinges, carefully oiled, were inthe habit of opening more frequently than was supposed. This softness wassuspicious; it hinted at furtive goings and comings, silent entrances andexits of nocturnal men, and the wolf-like tread of crime.</p><p>The sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band. Thistaciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods.</p><p>Thénardier opened the gate a little way, allowing just sufficient spacefor Jean Valjean to pass out, closed the grating again, gave the key adouble turn in the lock and plunged back into the darkness, without makingany more noise than a breath. He seemed to walk with the velvet paws of atiger.</p><p>A moment later, that hideous providence had retreated into theinvisibility.</p><p>Jean Valjean found himself in the open air.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0337" id="link2HCH0337"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;MARIUS PRODUCES ON SOME ONE WHO IS A JUDGE OF THE MATTER,THE EFFECT OF BEING DEAD</h3><p>He allowed Marius to slide down upon the shore.</p><p>They were in the open air!</p><p>The miasmas, darkness, horror lay behind him. The pure, healthful, living,joyous air that was easy to breathe inundated him. Everywhere around himreigned silence, but that charming silence when the sun has set in anunclouded azure sky. Twilight had descended; night was drawing on, thegreat deliverer, the friend of all those who need a mantle of darknessthat they may escape from an anguish. The sky presented itself in alldirections like an enormous calm. The river flowed to his feet with thesound of a kiss. The aerial dialogue of the nests bidding each other goodnight in the elms of the Champs-Élysées was audible. A few stars, daintilypiercing the pale blue of the zenith, and visible to reverie alone, formedimperceptible little splendors amid the immensity. Evening was unfoldingover the head of Jean Valjean all the sweetness of the infinite.</p><p>It was that exquisite and undecided hour which says neither yes nor no.Night was already sufficiently advanced to render it possible to loseoneself at a little distance and yet there was sufficient daylight topermit of recognition at close quarters.</p><p>For several seconds, Jean Valjean was irresistibly overcome by that augustand caressing serenity; such moments of oblivion do come to men; sufferingrefrains from harassing the unhappy wretch; everything is eclipsed in thethoughts; peace broods over the dreamer like night; and, beneath thetwilight which beams and in imitation of the sky which is illuminated, thesoul becomes studded with stars. Jean Valjean could not refrain fromcontemplating that vast, clear shadow which rested over him; thoughtfullyhe bathed in the sea of ecstasy and prayer in the majestic silence of theeternal heavens. Then he bent down swiftly to Marius, as though thesentiment of duty had returned to him, and, dipping up water in the hollowof his hand, he gently sprinkled a few drops on the latter&rsquo;s face. Marius&rsquo;eyelids did not open; but his half-open mouth still breathed.</p><p>Jean Valjean was on the point of dipping his hand in the river once more,when, all at once, he experienced an indescribable embarrassment, such asa person feels when there is some one behind him whom he does not see.</p><p>We have already alluded to this impression, with which everyone isfamiliar.</p><p>He turned round.</p><p>Some one was, in fact, behind him, as there had been a short while before.</p><p>A man of lofty stature, enveloped in a long coat, with folded arms, andbearing in his right fist a bludgeon of which the leaden head was visible,stood a few paces in the rear of the spot where Jean Valjean was crouchingover Marius.</p><p>With the aid of the darkness, it seemed a sort of apparition. An ordinaryman would have been alarmed because of the twilight, a thoughtful man onaccount of the bludgeon. Jean Valjean recognized Javert.</p><p>The reader has divined, no doubt, that Thénardier&rsquo;s pursuer was no otherthan Javert. Javert, after his unlooked-for escape from the barricade, hadbetaken himself to the prefecture of police, had rendered a verbal accountto the Prefect in person in a brief audience, had then immediately gone onduty again, which implied&mdash;the note, the reader will recollect, whichhad been captured on his person&mdash;a certain surveillance of the shoreon the right bank of the Seine near the Champs-Élysées, which had, forsome time past, aroused the attention of the police. There he had caughtsight of Thénardier and had followed him. The reader knows the rest.</p><p>Thus it will be easily understood that that grating, so obligingly openedto Jean Valjean, was a bit of cleverness on Thénardier&rsquo;s part. Thénardierintuitively felt that Javert was still there; the man spied upon has ascent which never deceives him; it was necessary to fling a bone to thatsleuth-hound. An assassin, what a godsend! Such an opportunity must neverbe allowed to slip. Thénardier, by putting Jean Valjean outside in hisstead, provided a prey for the police, forced them to relinquish hisscent, made them forget him in a bigger adventure, repaid Javert for hiswaiting, which always flatters a spy, earned thirty francs, and countedwith certainty, so far as he himself was concerned, on escaping with theaid of this diversion.</p><p>Jean Valjean had fallen from one danger upon another.</p><p>These two encounters, this falling one after the other, from Thénardierupon Javert, was a rude shock.</p><p>Javert did not recognize Jean Valjean, who, as we have stated, no longerlooked like himself. He did not unfold his arms, he made sure of hisbludgeon in his fist, by an imperceptible movement, and said in a curt,calm voice:</p><p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who is &lsquo;I&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Jean Valjean.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert thrust his bludgeon between his teeth, bent his knees, inclined hisbody, laid his two powerful hands on the shoulders of Jean Valjean, whichwere clamped within them as in a couple of vices, scrutinized him, andrecognized him. Their faces almost touched. Javert&rsquo;s look was terrible.</p><p>Jean Valjean remained inert beneath Javert&rsquo;s grasp, like a lion submittingto the claws of a lynx.</p><p>&ldquo;Inspector Javert,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have me in your power. Moreover, I haveregarded myself as your prisoner ever since this morning. I did not giveyou my address with any intention of escaping from you. Take me. Onlygrant me one favor.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert did not appear to hear him. He kept his eyes riveted on JeanValjean. His chin being contracted, thrust his lips upwards towards hisnose, a sign of savage reverie. At length he released Jean Valjean,straightened himself stiffly up without bending, grasped his bludgeonagain firmly, and, as though in a dream, he murmured rather than utteredthis question:</p><p>&ldquo;What are you doing here? And who is this man?&rdquo;</p><p>He still abstained from addressing Jean Valjean as <i>thou</i>.</p><p>Jean Valjean replied, and the sound of his voice appeared to rouse Javert:</p><p>&ldquo;It is with regard to him that I desire to speak to you. Dispose of me asyou see fit; but first help me to carry him home. That is all that I askof you.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert&rsquo;s face contracted as was always the case when any one seemed tothink him capable of making a concession. Nevertheless, he did not say&ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p><p>Again he bent over, drew from his pocket a handkerchief which he moistenedin the water and with which he then wiped Marius&rsquo; blood-stained brow.</p><p>&ldquo;This man was at the barricade,&rdquo; said he in a low voice and as thoughspeaking to himself. &ldquo;He is the one they called Marius.&rdquo;</p><p>A spy of the first quality, who had observed everything, listened toeverything, and taken in everything, even when he thought that he was todie; who had played the spy even in his agony, and who, with his elbowsleaning on the first step of the sepulchre, had taken notes.</p><p>He seized Marius&rsquo; hand and felt his pulse.</p><p>&ldquo;He is wounded,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;He is a dead man,&rdquo; said Javert.</p><p>Jean Valjean replied:</p><p>&ldquo;No. Not yet.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you have brought him thither from the barricade?&rdquo; remarked Javert.</p><p>His preoccupation must indeed have been very profound for him not toinsist on this alarming rescue through the sewer, and for him not to evennotice Jean Valjean&rsquo;s silence after his question.</p><p>Jean Valjean, on his side, seemed to have but one thought. He resumed:</p><p>&ldquo;He lives in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, with his grandfather.I do not recollect his name.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean fumbled in Marius&rsquo; coat, pulled out his pocket-book, openedit at the page which Marius had pencilled, and held it out to Javert.</p><p>There was still sufficient light to admit of reading. Besides this, Javertpossessed in his eye the feline phosphorescence of night birds. Hedeciphered the few lines written by Marius, and muttered: &ldquo;Gillenormand,Rue des Filles-du Calvaire, No. 6.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he exclaimed: &ldquo;Coachman!&rdquo;</p><p>The reader will remember that the hackney-coach was waiting in case ofneed.</p><p>Javert kept Marius&rsquo; pocket-book.</p><p>A moment later, the carriage, which had descended by the inclined plane ofthe watering-place, was on the shore. Marius was laid upon the back seat,and Javert seated himself on the front seat beside Jean Valjean.</p><p>The door slammed, and the carriage drove rapidly away, ascending the quaysin the direction of the Bastille.</p><p>They quitted the quays and entered the streets. The coachman, a black formon his box, whipped up his thin horses. A glacial silence reigned in thecarriage. Marius, motionless, with his body resting in the corner, and hishead drooping on his breast, his arms hanging, his legs stiff, seemed tobe awaiting only a coffin; Jean Valjean seemed made of shadow, and Javertof stone, and in that vehicle full of night, whose interior, every timethat it passed in front of a street lantern, appeared to be turned lividlywan, as by an intermittent flash of lightning, chance had united andseemed to be bringing face to face the three forms of tragic immobility,the corpse, the spectre, and the statue.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0338" id="link2HCH0338"></a>CHAPTER X&mdash;RETURN OF THE SON WHO WAS PRODIGAL OF HIS LIFE</h3><p>At every jolt over the pavement, a drop of blood trickled from Marius&rsquo;hair.</p><p>Night had fully closed in when the carriage arrived at No. 6, Rue desFilles-du-Calvaire.</p><p>Javert was the first to alight; he made sure with one glance of the numberon the carriage gate, and, raising the heavy knocker of beaten iron,embellished in the old style, with a male goat and a satyr confrontingeach other, he gave a violent peal. The gate opened a little way andJavert gave it a push. The porter half made his appearance yawning,vaguely awake, and with a candle in his hand.</p><p>Everyone in the house was asleep. People go to bed betimes in the Marais,especially on days when there is a revolt. This good, old quarter,terrified at the Revolution, takes refuge in slumber, as children, whenthey hear the Bugaboo coming, hide their heads hastily under theircoverlet.</p><p>In the meantime Jean Valjean and the coachman had taken Marius out of thecarriage, Jean Valjean supporting him under the armpits, and the coachmanunder the knees.</p><p>As they thus bore Marius, Jean Valjean slipped his hand under the latter&rsquo;sclothes, which were broadly rent, felt his breast, and assured himselfthat his heart was still beating. It was even beating a little lessfeebly, as though the movement of the carriage had brought about a certainfresh access of life.</p><p>Javert addressed the porter in a tone befitting the government, and thepresence of the porter of a factious person.</p><p>&ldquo;Some person whose name is Gillenormand?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Here. What do you want with him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;His son is brought back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;His son?&rdquo; said the porter stupidly.</p><p>&ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean, who, soiled and tattered, stood behind Javert, and whom theporter was surveying with some horror, made a sign to him with his headthat this was not so.</p><p>The porter did not appear to understand either Javert&rsquo;s words or JeanValjean&rsquo;s sign.</p><p>Javert continued:</p><p>&ldquo;He went to the barricade, and here he is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To the barricade?&rdquo; ejaculated the porter.</p><p>&ldquo;He has got himself killed. Go waken his father.&rdquo;</p><p>The porter did not stir.</p><p>&ldquo;Go along with you!&rdquo; repeated Javert.</p><p>And he added:</p><p>&ldquo;There will be a funeral here to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>For Javert, the usual incidents of the public highway were categoricallyclassed, which is the beginning of foresight and surveillance, and eachcontingency had its own compartment; all possible facts were arranged indrawers, as it were, whence they emerged on occasion, in variablequantities; in the street, uproar, revolt, carnival, and funeral.</p><p>The porter contented himself with waking Basque. Basque woke Nicolette;Nicolette roused great-aunt Gillenormand.</p><p>As for the grandfather, they let him sleep on, thinking that he would hearabout the matter early enough in any case.</p><p>Marius was carried up to the first floor, without any one in the otherparts of the house being aware of the fact, and deposited on an old sofain M. Gillenormand&rsquo;s antechamber; and while Basque went in search of aphysician, and while Nicolette opened the linen-presses, Jean Valjean feltJavert touch him on the shoulder. He understood and descended the stairs,having behind him the step of Javert who was following him.</p><p>The porter watched them take their departure as he had watched theirarrival, in terrified somnolence.</p><p>They entered the carriage once more, and the coachman mounted his box.</p><p>&ldquo;Inspector Javert,&rdquo; said Jean, &ldquo;grant me yet another favor.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; demanded Javert roughly.</p><p>&ldquo;Let me go home for one instant. Then you shall do whatever you like withme.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert remained silent for a few moments, with his chin drawn back intothe collar of his great-coat, then he lowered the glass and front:</p><p>&ldquo;Driver,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé, No. 7.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0339" id="link2HCH0339"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;CONCUSSION IN THE ABSOLUTE</h3><p>They did not open their lips again during the whole space of their ride.</p><p>What did Jean Valjean want? To finish what he had begun; to warn Cosette,to tell her where Marius was, to give her, possibly, some other usefulinformation, to take, if he could, certain final measures. As for himself,so far as he was personally concerned, all was over; he had been seized byJavert and had not resisted; any other man than himself in like situationwould, perhaps, have had some vague thoughts connected with the rope whichThénardier had given him, and of the bars of the first cell that he shouldenter; but, let us impress it upon the reader, after the Bishop, there hadexisted in Jean Valjean a profound hesitation in the presence of anyviolence, even when directed against himself.</p><p>Suicide, that mysterious act of violence against the unknown which maycontain, in a measure, the death of the soul, was impossible to JeanValjean.</p><p>At the entrance to the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé, the carriage halted, the waybeing too narrow to admit of the entrance of vehicles. Javert and JeanValjean alighted.</p><p>The coachman humbly represented to &ldquo;monsieur l&rsquo;Inspecteur,&rdquo; that theUtrecht velvet of his carriage was all spotted with the blood of theassassinated man, and with mire from the assassin. That is the way heunderstood it. He added that an indemnity was due him. At the same time,drawing his certificate book from his pocket, he begged the inspector tohave the goodness to write him &ldquo;a bit of an attestation.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert thrust aside the book which the coachman held out to him, and said:</p><p>&ldquo;How much do you want, including your time of waiting and the drive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It comes to seven hours and a quarter,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;and my velvetwas perfectly new. Eighty francs, Mr. Inspector.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert drew four napoleons from his pocket and dismissed the carriage.</p><p>Jean Valjean fancied that it was Javert&rsquo;s intention to conduct him on footto the post of the Blancs-Manteaux or to the post of the Archives, both ofwhich are close at hand.</p><p>They entered the street. It was deserted as usual. Javert followed JeanValjean. They reached No. 7. Jean Valjean knocked. The door opened.</p><p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Javert. &ldquo;Go upstairs.&rdquo;</p><p>He added with a strange expression, and as though he were exerting aneffort in speaking in this manner:</p><p>&ldquo;I will wait for you here.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean looked at Javert. This mode of procedure was but little inaccord with Javert&rsquo;s habits. However, he could not be greatly surprisedthat Javert should now have a sort of haughty confidence in him, theconfidence of the cat which grants the mouse liberty to the length of itsclaws, seeing that Jean Valjean had made up his mind to surrender himselfand to make an end of it. He pushed open the door, entered the house,called to the porter who was in bed and who had pulled the cord from hiscouch: &ldquo;It is I!&rdquo; and ascended the stairs.</p><p>On arriving at the first floor, he paused. All sorrowful roads have theirstations. The window on the landing-place, which was a sash-window, wasopen. As in many ancient houses, the staircase got its light from withoutand had a view on the street. The street-lantern, situated directlyopposite, cast some light on the stairs, and thus effected some economy inillumination.</p><p>Jean Valjean, either for the sake of getting the air, or mechanically,thrust his head out of this window. He leaned out over the street. It isshort, and the lantern lighted it from end to end. Jean Valjean wasoverwhelmed with amazement; there was no longer any one there.</p><p>Javert had taken his departure.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0340" id="link2HCH0340"></a>CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE GRANDFATHER</h3><p>Basque and the porter had carried Marius into the drawing-room, as hestill lay stretched out, motionless, on the sofa upon which he had beenplaced on his arrival. The doctor who had been sent for had hastenedthither. Aunt Gillenormand had risen.</p><p>Aunt Gillenormand went and came, in affright, wringing her hands andincapable of doing anything but saying: &ldquo;Heavens! is it possible?&rdquo; Attimes she added: &ldquo;Everything will be covered with blood.&rdquo; When her firsthorror had passed off, a certain philosophy of the situation penetratedher mind, and took form in the exclamation: &ldquo;It was bound to end in thisway!&rdquo; She did not go so far as: &ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; which is customary onthis sort of occasion. At the physician&rsquo;s orders, a camp bed had beenprepared beside the sofa. The doctor examined Marius, and after havingfound that his pulse was still beating, that the wounded man had no verydeep wound on his breast, and that the blood on the corners of his lipsproceeded from his nostrils, he had him placed flat on the bed, without apillow, with his head on the same level as his body, and even a triflelower, and with his bust bare in order to facilitate respiration.Mademoiselle Gillenormand, on perceiving that they were undressing Marius,withdrew. She set herself to telling her beads in her own chamber.</p><p>The trunk had not suffered any internal injury; a bullet, deadened by thepocket-book, had turned aside and made the tour of his ribs with a hideouslaceration, which was of no great depth, and consequently, not dangerous.The long, underground journey had completed the dislocation of the brokencollar-bone, and the disorder there was serious. The arms had been slashedwith sabre cuts. Not a single scar disfigured his face; but his head wasfairly covered with cuts; what would be the result of these wounds on thehead? Would they stop short at the hairy cuticle, or would they attack thebrain? As yet, this could not be decided. A grave symptom was that theyhad caused a swoon, and that people do not always recover from suchswoons. Moreover, the wounded man had been exhausted by hemorrhage. Fromthe waist down, the barricade had protected the lower part of the bodyfrom injury.</p><p>Basque and Nicolette tore up linen and prepared bandages; Nicolette sewedthem, Basque rolled them. As lint was lacking, the doctor, for the timebeing, arrested the bleeding with layers of wadding. Beside the bed, threecandles burned on a table where the case of surgical instruments layspread out. The doctor bathed Marius&rsquo; face and hair with cold water. Afull pail was reddened in an instant. The porter, candle in hand, lightedthem.</p><p>The doctor seemed to be pondering sadly. From time to time, he made anegative sign with his head, as though replying to some question which hehad inwardly addressed to himself.</p><p>A bad sign for the sick man are these mysterious dialogues of the doctorwith himself.</p><p>At the moment when the doctor was wiping Marius&rsquo; face, and lightlytouching his still closed eyes with his finger, a door opened at the endof the drawing-room, and a long, pallid figure made its appearance.</p><p>This was the grandfather.</p><p>The revolt had, for the past two days, deeply agitated, enraged andengrossed the mind of M. Gillenormand. He had not been able to sleep onthe previous night, and he had been in a fever all day long. In theevening, he had gone to bed very early, recommending that everything inthe house should be well barred, and he had fallen into a doze throughsheer fatigue.</p><p>Old men sleep lightly; M. Gillenormand&rsquo;s chamber adjoined thedrawing-room, and in spite of all the precautions that had been taken, thenoise had awakened him. Surprised at the rift of light which he saw underhis door, he had risen from his bed, and had groped his way thither.</p><p>He stood astonished on the threshold, one hand on the handle of thehalf-open door, with his head bent a little forward and quivering, hisbody wrapped in a white dressing-gown, which was straight and as destituteof folds as a winding-sheet; and he had the air of a phantom who is gazinginto a tomb.</p><p>He saw the bed, and on the mattress that young man, bleeding, white with awaxen whiteness, with closed eyes and gaping mouth, and pallid lips,stripped to the waist, slashed all over with crimson wounds, motionlessand brilliantly lighted up.</p><p>The grandfather trembled from head to foot as powerfully as ossified limbscan tremble, his eyes, whose corneæ were yellow on account of his greatage, were veiled in a sort of vitreous glitter, his whole face assumed inan instant the earthy angles of a skull, his arms fell pendent, as thougha spring had broken, and his amazement was betrayed by the outspreading ofthe fingers of his two aged hands, which quivered all over, his kneesformed an angle in front, allowing, through the opening in hisdressing-gown, a view of his poor bare legs, all bristling with whitehairs, and he murmured:</p><p>&ldquo;Marius!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Basque, &ldquo;Monsieur has just been brought back. He went to thebarricade, and....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is dead!&rdquo; cried the old man in a terrible voice. &ldquo;Ah! The rascal!&rdquo;</p><p>Then a sort of sepulchral transformation straightened up this centenarianas erect as a young man.</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are the doctor. Begin by telling me one thing. He isdead, is he not?&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor, who was at the highest pitch of anxiety, remained silent.</p><p>M. Gillenormand wrung his hands with an outburst of terrible laughter.</p><p>&ldquo;He is dead! He is dead! He is dead! He has got himself killed on thebarricades! Out of hatred to me! He did that to spite me! Ah! Youblood-drinker! This is the way he returns to me! Misery of my life, he isdead!&rdquo;</p><p>He went to the window, threw it wide open as though he were stifling, and,erect before the darkness, he began to talk into the street, to the night:</p><p>&ldquo;Pierced, sabred, exterminated, slashed, hacked in pieces! Just look atthat, the villain! He knew well that I was waiting for him, and that I hadhad his room arranged, and that I had placed at the head of my bed hisportrait taken when he was a little child! He knew well that he had onlyto come back, and that I had been recalling him for years, and that Iremained by my fireside, with my hands on my knees, not knowing what todo, and that I was mad over it! You knew well, that you had but to returnand to say: &lsquo;It is I,&rsquo; and you would have been the master of the house,and that I should have obeyed you, and that you could have done whateveryou pleased with your old numskull of a grandfather! you knew that well,and you said:</p><p>&ldquo;No, he is a Royalist, I will not go! And you went to the barricades, andyou got yourself killed out of malice! To revenge yourself for what I saidto you about Monsieur le Duc de Berry. It is infamous! Go to bed then andsleep tranquilly! he is dead, and this is my awakening.&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor, who was beginning to be uneasy in both quarters, quittedMarius for a moment, went to M. Gillenormand, and took his arm. Thegrandfather turned round, gazed at him with eyes which seemed exaggeratedin size and bloodshot, and said to him calmly:</p><p>&ldquo;I thank you, sir. I am composed, I am a man, I witnessed the death ofLouis XVI., I know how to bear events. One thing is terrible and that isto think that it is your newspapers which do all the mischief. You willhave scribblers, chatterers, lawyers, orators, tribunes, discussions,progress, enlightenment, the rights of man, the liberty of the press, andthis is the way that your children will be brought home to you. Ah!Marius! It is abominable! Killed! Dead before me! A barricade! Ah, thescamp! Doctor, you live in this quarter, I believe? Oh! I know you well. Isee your cabriolet pass my window. I am going to tell you. You are wrongto think that I am angry. One does not fly into a rage against a dead man.That would be stupid. This is a child whom I have reared. I was alreadyold while he was very young. He played in the Tuileries garden with hislittle shovel and his little chair, and in order that the inspectors mightnot grumble, I stopped up the holes that he made in the earth with hisshovel, with my cane. One day he exclaimed: Down with Louis XVIII.! andoff he went. It was no fault of mine. He was all rosy and blond. Hismother is dead. Have you ever noticed that all little children are blond?Why is it so? He is the son of one of those brigands of the Loire, butchildren are innocent of their fathers&rsquo; crimes. I remember when he was nohigher than that. He could not manage to pronounce his Ds. He had a way oftalking that was so sweet and indistinct that you would have thought itwas a bird chirping. I remember that once, in front of the HerculesFarnese, people formed a circle to admire him and marvel at him, he was sohandsome, was that child! He had a head such as you see in pictures. Italked in a deep voice, and I frightened him with my cane, but he knewvery well that it was only to make him laugh. In the morning, when heentered my room, I grumbled, but he was like the sunlight to me, all thesame. One cannot defend oneself against those brats. They take hold ofyou, they hold you fast, they never let you go again. The truth is, thatthere never was a cupid like that child. Now, what can you say for yourLafayettes, your Benjamin Constants, and your Tirecuir de Corcelles whohave killed him? This cannot be allowed to pass in this fashion.&rdquo;</p><p>He approached Marius, who still lay livid and motionless, and to whom thephysician had returned, and began once more to wring his hands. The oldman&rsquo;s pallid lips moved as though mechanically, and permitted the passageof words that were barely audible, like breaths in the death agony:</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! heartless lad! Ah! clubbist! Ah! wretch! Ah! Septembrist!&rdquo;</p><p>Reproaches in the low voice of an agonizing man, addressed to a corpse.</p><p>Little by little, as it is always indispensable that internal eruptionsshould come to the light, the sequence of words returned, but thegrandfather appeared no longer to have the strength to utter them, hisvoice was so weak, and extinct, that it seemed to come from the other sideof an abyss:</p><p>&ldquo;It is all the same to me, I am going to die too, that I am. And to thinkthat there is not a hussy in Paris who would not have been delighted tomake this wretch happy! A scamp who, instead of amusing himself andenjoying life, went off to fight and get himself shot down like a brute!And for whom? Why? For the Republic! Instead of going to dance at theChaumière, as it is the duty of young folks to do! What&rsquo;s the use of beingtwenty years old? The Republic, a cursed pretty folly! Poor mothers, begetfine boys, do! Come, he is dead. That will make two funerals under thesame carriage gate. So you have got yourself arranged like this for thesake of General Lamarque&rsquo;s handsome eyes! What had that General Lamarquedone to you? A slasher! A chatter-box! To get oneself killed for a deadman! If that isn&rsquo;t enough to drive any one mad! Just think of it! Attwenty! And without so much as turning his head to see whether he was notleaving something behind him! That&rsquo;s the way poor, good old fellows areforced to die alone, nowadays. Perish in your corner, owl! Well, afterall, so much the better, that is what I was hoping for, this will kill meon the spot. I am too old, I am a hundred years old, I am a hundredthousand years old, I ought, by rights, to have been dead long ago. Thisblow puts an end to it. So all is over, what happiness! What is the goodof making him inhale ammonia and all that parcel of drugs? You are wastingyour trouble, you fool of a doctor! Come, he&rsquo;s dead, completely dead. Iknow all about it, I am dead myself too. He hasn&rsquo;t done things by half.Yes, this age is infamous, infamous and that&rsquo;s what I think of you, ofyour ideas, of your systems, of your masters, of your oracles, of yourdoctors, of your scape-graces of writers, of your rascally philosophers,and of all the revolutions which, for the last sixty years, have beenfrightening the flocks of crows in the Tuileries! But you were pitiless ingetting yourself killed like this, I shall not even grieve over yourdeath, do you understand, you assassin?&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, Marius slowly opened his eyes, and his glance, stilldimmed by lethargic wonder, rested on M. Gillenormand.</p><p>&ldquo;Marius!&rdquo; cried the old man. &ldquo;Marius! My little Marius! my child! mywell-beloved son! You open your eyes, you gaze upon me, you are alive,thanks!&rdquo;</p><p>And he fell fainting.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0392" id="link2H_4_0392"></a>BOOK FOURTH&mdash;JAVERT DERAILED</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0341" id="link2HCH0341"></a>CHAPTER I</h3><p>Javert passed slowly down the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé.</p><p>He walked with drooping head for the first time in his life, and likewise,for the first time in his life, with his hands behind his back.</p><p>Up to that day, Javert had borrowed from Napoleon&rsquo;s attitudes, only thatwhich is expressive of resolution, with arms folded across the chest; thatwhich is expressive of uncertainty&mdash;with the hands behind the back&mdash;hadbeen unknown to him. Now, a change had taken place; his whole person, slowand sombre, was stamped with anxiety.</p><p>He plunged into the silent streets.</p><p>Nevertheless, he followed one given direction.</p><p>He took the shortest cut to the Seine, reached the Quai des Ormes, skirtedthe quay, passed the Grève, and halted at some distance from the post ofthe Place du Châtelet, at the angle of the Pont Notre-Dame. There, betweenthe Notre-Dame and the Pont au Change on the one hand, and the Quai de laMégisserie and the Quai aux Fleurs on the other, the Seine forms a sort ofsquare lake, traversed by a rapid.</p><p>This point of the Seine is dreaded by mariners. Nothing is more dangerousthan this rapid, hemmed in, at that epoch, and irritated by the piles ofthe mill on the bridge, now demolished. The two bridges, situated thusclose together, augment the peril; the water hurries in formidable wisethrough the arches. It rolls in vast and terrible waves; it accumulatesand piles up there; the flood attacks the piles of the bridges as thoughin an effort to pluck them up with great liquid ropes. Men who fall inthere never reappear; the best of swimmers are drowned there.</p><p>Javert leaned both elbows on the parapet, his chin resting in both hands,and, while his nails were mechanically twined in the abundance of hiswhiskers, he meditated.</p><p>A novelty, a revolution, a catastrophe had just taken place in the depthsof his being; and he had something upon which to examine himself.</p><p>Javert was undergoing horrible suffering.</p><p>For several hours, Javert had ceased to be simple. He was troubled; thatbrain, so limpid in its blindness, had lost its transparency; that crystalwas clouded. Javert felt duty divided within his conscience, and he couldnot conceal the fact from himself. When he had so unexpectedly encounteredJean Valjean on the banks of the Seine, there had been in him something ofthe wolf which regains his grip on his prey, and of the dog who finds hismaster again.</p><p>He beheld before him two paths, both equally straight, but he beheld two;and that terrified him; him, who had never in all his life known more thanone straight line. And, the poignant anguish lay in this, that the twopaths were contrary to each other. One of these straight lines excludedthe other. Which of the two was the true one?</p><p>His situation was indescribable.</p><p>To owe his life to a malefactor, to accept that debt and to repay it; tobe, in spite of himself, on a level with a fugitive from justice, and torepay his service with another service; to allow it to be said to him,&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; and to say to the latter in his turn: &ldquo;Be free&rdquo;; to sacrifice topersonal motives duty, that general obligation, and to be conscious, inthose personal motives, of something that was also general, and,perchance, superior, to betray society in order to remain true to hisconscience; that all these absurdities should be realized and shouldaccumulate upon him,&mdash;this was what overwhelmed him.</p><p>One thing had amazed him,&mdash;this was that Jean Valjean should havedone him a favor, and one thing petrified him,&mdash;that he, Javert,should have done Jean Valjean a favor.</p><p>Where did he stand? He sought to comprehend his position, and could nolonger find his bearings.</p><p>What was he to do now? To deliver up Jean Valjean was bad; to leave JeanValjean at liberty was bad. In the first case, the man of authority felllower than the man of the galleys, in the second, a convict rose above thelaw, and set his foot upon it. In both cases, dishonor for him, Javert.There was disgrace in any resolution at which he might arrive. Destiny hassome extremities which rise perpendicularly from the impossible, andbeyond which life is no longer anything but a precipice. Javert hadreached one of those extremities.</p><p>One of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think. The veryviolence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it. Thought wassomething to which he was unused, and which was peculiarly painful.</p><p>In thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion; andit irritated him to have that within him.</p><p>Thought on any subject whatever, outside of the restricted circle of hisfunctions, would have been for him in any case useless and a fatigue;thought on the day which had just passed was a torture. Nevertheless, itwas indispensable that he should take a look into his conscience, aftersuch shocks, and render to himself an account of himself.</p><p>What he had just done made him shudder. He, Javert, had seen fit todecide, contrary to all the regulations of the police, contrary to thewhole social and judicial organization, contrary to the entire code, upona release; this had suited him; he had substituted his own affairs for theaffairs of the public; was not this unjustifiable? Every time that hebrought himself face to face with this deed without a name which he hadcommitted, he trembled from head to foot. Upon what should he decide? Onesole resource remained to him; to return in all haste to the Rue del&rsquo;Homme Armé, and commit Jean Valjean to prison. It was clear that thatwas what he ought to do. He could not.</p><p>Something barred his way in that direction.</p><p>Something? What? Is there in the world, anything outside of the tribunals,executory sentences, the police and the authorities? Javert wasoverwhelmed.</p><p>A galley-slave sacred! A convict who could not be touched by the law! Andthat the deed of Javert!</p><p>Was it not a fearful thing that Javert and Jean Valjean, the man made toproceed with vigor, the man made to submit,&mdash;that these two men whowere both the things of the law, should have come to such a pass, thatboth of them had set themselves above the law? What then! such enormitieswere to happen and no one was to be punished! Jean Valjean, stronger thanthe whole social order, was to remain at liberty, and he, Javert, was togo on eating the government&rsquo;s bread!</p><p>His reverie gradually became terrible.</p><p>He might, athwart this reverie, have also reproached himself on the subjectof that insurgent who had been taken to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire;but he never even thought of that. The lesser fault was lost in thegreater. Besides, that insurgent was, obviously, a dead man, and, legally,death puts an end to pursuit.</p><p>Jean Valjean was the load which weighed upon his spirit.</p><p>Jean Valjean disconcerted him. All the axioms which had served him aspoints of support all his life long, had crumbled away in the presence ofthis man. Jean Valjean&rsquo;s generosity towards him, Javert, crushed him.Other facts which he now recalled, and which he had formerly treated aslies and folly, now recurred to him as realities. M. Madeleine reappearedbehind Jean Valjean, and the two figures were superposed in such fashionthat they now formed but one, which was venerable. Javert felt thatsomething terrible was penetrating his soul&mdash;admiration for aconvict. Respect for a galley-slave&mdash;is that a possible thing? Heshuddered at it, yet could not escape from it. In vain did he struggle, hewas reduced to confess, in his inmost heart, the sublimity of that wretch.This was odious.</p><p>A benevolent malefactor, merciful, gentle, helpful, clement, a convict,returning good for evil, giving back pardon for hatred, preferring pity tovengeance, preferring to ruin himself rather than to ruin his enemy,saving him who had smitten him, kneeling on the heights of virtue, morenearly akin to an angel than to a man. Javert was constrained to admit tohimself that this monster existed.</p><p>Things could not go on in this manner.</p><p>Certainly, and we insist upon this point, he had not yielded withoutresistance to that monster, to that infamous angel, to that hideous hero,who enraged almost as much as he amazed him. Twenty times, as he sat inthat carriage face to face with Jean Valjean, the legal tiger had roaredwithin him. A score of times he had been tempted to fling himself uponJean Valjean, to seize him and devour him, that is to say, to arrest him.What more simple, in fact? To cry out at the first post that they passed:&mdash;&ldquo;Hereis a fugitive from justice, who has broken his ban!&rdquo; to summon thegendarmes and say to them: &ldquo;This man is yours!&rdquo; then to go off, leavingthat condemned man there, to ignore the rest and not to meddle further inthe matter. This man is forever a prisoner of the law; the law may do withhim what it will. What could be more just? Javert had said all this tohimself; he had wished to pass beyond, to act, to apprehend the man, andthen, as at present, he had not been able to do it; and every time thathis arm had been raised convulsively towards Jean Valjean&rsquo;s collar, hishand had fallen back again, as beneath an enormous weight, and in thedepths of his thought he had heard a voice, a strange voice crying to him:&mdash;&ldquo;Itis well. Deliver up your savior. Then have the basin of Pontius Pilatebrought and wash your claws.&rdquo;</p><p>Then his reflections reverted to himself and beside Jean Valjean glorifiedhe beheld himself, Javert, degraded.</p><p>A convict was his benefactor!</p><p>But then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive? He had theright to be killed in that barricade. He should have asserted that right.It would have been better to summon the other insurgents to his succoragainst Jean Valjean, to get himself shot by force.</p><p>His supreme anguish was the loss of certainty. He felt that he had beenuprooted. The code was no longer anything more than a stump in his hand.He had to deal with scruples of an unknown species. There had taken placewithin him a sentimental revelation entirely distinct from legalaffirmation, his only standard of measurement hitherto. To remain in hisformer uprightness did not suffice. A whole order of unexpected facts hadcropped up and subjugated him. A whole new world was dawning on his soul:kindness accepted and repaid, devotion, mercy, indulgence, violencescommitted by pity on austerity, respect for persons, no more definitivecondemnation, no more conviction, the possibility of a tear in the eye ofthe law, no one knows what justice according to God, running in inversesense to justice according to men. He perceived amid the shadows theterrible rising of an unknown moral sun; it horrified and dazzled him. Anowl forced to the gaze of an eagle.</p><p>He said to himself that it was true that there were exceptional cases,that authority might be put out of countenance, that the rule might beinadequate in the presence of a fact, that everything could not be framedwithin the text of the code, that the unforeseen compelled obedience, thatthe virtue of a convict might set a snare for the virtue of thefunctionary, that destiny did indulge in such ambushes, and he reflectedwith despair that he himself had not even been fortified against asurprise.</p><p>He was forced to acknowledge that goodness did exist. This convict hadbeen good. And he himself, unprecedented circumstance, had just been goodalso. So he was becoming depraved.</p><p>He found that he was a coward. He conceived a horror of himself.</p><p>Javert&rsquo;s ideal, was not to be human, to be grand, to be sublime; it was tobe irreproachable.</p><p>Now, he had just failed in this.</p><p>How had he come to such a pass? How had all this happened? He could nothave told himself. He clasped his head in both hands, but in spite of allthat he could do, he could not contrive to explain it to himself.</p><p>He had certainly always entertained the intention of restoring JeanValjean to the law of which Jean Valjean was the captive, and of which he,Javert, was the slave. Not for a single instant while he held him in hisgrasp had he confessed to himself that he entertained the idea ofreleasing him. It was, in some sort, without his consciousness, that hishand had relaxed and had let him go free.</p><p>All sorts of interrogation points flashed before his eyes. He putquestions to himself, and made replies to himself, and his repliesfrightened him. He asked himself: &ldquo;What has that convict done, thatdesperate fellow, whom I have pursued even to persecution, and who has hadme under his foot, and who could have avenged himself, and who owed itboth to his rancor and to his safety, in leaving me my life, in showingmercy upon me? His duty? No. Something more. And I in showing mercy uponhim in my turn&mdash;what have I done? My duty? No. Something more. Sothere is something beyond duty?&rdquo; Here he took fright; his balance becamedisjointed; one of the scales fell into the abyss, the other roseheavenward, and Javert was no less terrified by the one which was on highthan by the one which was below. Without being in the least in the worldwhat is called Voltairian or a philosopher, or incredulous, being, on thecontrary, respectful by instinct, towards the established church, he knewit only as an august fragment of the social whole; order was his dogma,and sufficed for him; ever since he had attained to man&rsquo;s estate and therank of a functionary, he had centred nearly all his religion in thepolice. Being,&mdash;and here we employ words without the least irony andin their most serious acceptation, being, as we have said, a spy as othermen are priests. He had a superior, M. Gisquet; up to that day he hadnever dreamed of that other superior, God.</p><p>This new chief, God, he became unexpectedly conscious of, and he feltembarrassed by him. This unforeseen presence threw him off his bearings;he did not know what to do with this superior, he, who was not ignorant ofthe fact that the subordinate is bound always to bow, that he must notdisobey, nor find fault, nor discuss, and that, in the presence of asuperior who amazes him too greatly, the inferior has no other resourcethan that of handing in his resignation.</p><p>But how was he to set about handing in his resignation to God?</p><p>However things might stand,&mdash;and it was to this point that hereverted constantly,&mdash;one fact dominated everything else for him, andthat was, that he had just committed a terrible infraction of the law. Hehad just shut his eyes on an escaped convict who had broken his ban. Hehad just set a galley-slave at large. He had just robbed the laws of a manwho belonged to them. That was what he had done. He no longer understoodhimself. The very reasons for his action escaped him; only their vertigowas left with him. Up to that moment he had lived with that blind faithwhich gloomy probity engenders. This faith had quitted him, this probityhad deserted him. All that he had believed in melted away. Truths which hedid not wish to recognize were besieging him, inexorably. Henceforth, hemust be a different man. He was suffering from the strange pains of aconscience abruptly operated on for the cataract. He saw that which it wasrepugnant to him to behold. He felt himself emptied, useless, put out ofjoint with his past life, turned out, dissolved. Authority was dead withinhim. He had no longer any reason for existing.</p><p>A terrible situation! to be touched.</p><p>To be granite and to doubt! to be the statue of Chastisement cast in onepiece in the mould of the law, and suddenly to become aware of the factthat one cherishes beneath one&rsquo;s breast of bronze something absurd anddisobedient which almost resembles a heart! To come to the pass ofreturning good for good, although one has said to oneself up to that daythat that good is evil! to be the watch-dog, and to lick the intruder&rsquo;shand! to be ice and melt! to be the pincers and to turn into a hand! tosuddenly feel one&rsquo;s fingers opening! to relax one&rsquo;s grip,&mdash;what aterrible thing!</p><p>The man-projectile no longer acquainted with his route and retreating!</p><p>To be obliged to confess this to oneself: infallibility is not infallible,there may exist error in the dogma, all has not been said when a codespeaks, society is not perfect, authority is complicated with vacillation,a crack is possible in the immutable, judges are but men, the law may err,tribunals may make a mistake! to behold a rift in the immense blue pane ofthe firmament!</p><p>That which was passing in Javert was the Fampoux of a rectilinearconscience, the derailment of a soul, the crushing of a probity which hadbeen irresistibly launched in a straight line and was breaking againstGod. It certainly was singular that the stoker of order, that the engineerof authority, mounted on the blind iron horse with its rigid road, couldbe unseated by a flash of light! that the immovable, the direct, thecorrect, the geometrical, the passive, the perfect, could bend! that thereshould exist for the locomotive a road to Damascus!</p><p>God, always within man, and refractory, He, the true conscience, to thefalse; a prohibition to the spark to die out; an order to the ray toremember the sun; an injunction to the soul to recognize the veritableabsolute when confronted with the fictitious absolute, humanity whichcannot be lost; the human heart indestructible; that splendid phenomenon,the finest, perhaps, of all our interior marvels, did Javert understandthis? Did Javert penetrate it? Did Javert account for it to himself?Evidently he did not. But beneath the pressure of that incontestableincomprehensibility he felt his brain bursting.</p><p>He was less the man transfigured than the victim of this prodigy. In allthis he perceived only the tremendous difficulty of existence. It seemedto him that, henceforth, his respiration was repressed forever. He was notaccustomed to having something unknown hanging over his head.</p><p>Up to this point, everything above him had been, to his gaze, merely asmooth, limpid and simple surface; there was nothing incomprehensible,nothing obscure; nothing that was not defined, regularly disposed, linked,precise, circumscribed, exact, limited, closed, fully provided for;authority was a plane surface; there was no fall in it, no dizziness inits presence. Javert had never beheld the unknown except from below. Theirregular, the unforeseen, the disordered opening of chaos, the possibleslip over a precipice&mdash;this was the work of the lower regions, ofrebels, of the wicked, of wretches. Now Javert threw himself back, and hewas suddenly terrified by this unprecedented apparition: a gulf on high.</p><p>What! one was dismantled from top to bottom! one was disconcerted,absolutely! In what could one trust! That which had been agreed upon wasgiving way! What! the defect in society&rsquo;s armor could be discovered by amagnanimous wretch! What! an honest servitor of the law could suddenlyfind himself caught between two crimes&mdash;the crime of allowing a manto escape and the crime of arresting him! everything was not settled inthe orders given by the State to the functionary! There might be blindalleys in duty! What,&mdash;all this was real! was it true that anex-ruffian, weighed down with convictions, could rise erect and end bybeing in the right? Was this credible? were there cases in which the lawshould retire before transfigured crime, and stammer its excuses?&mdash;Yes,that was the state of the case! and Javert saw it! and Javert had touchedit! and not only could he not deny it, but he had taken part in it. Thesewere realities. It was abominable that actual facts could reach suchdeformity. If facts did their duty, they would confine themselves to beingproofs of the law; facts&mdash;it is God who sends them. Was anarchy,then, on the point of now descending from on high?</p><p>Thus,&mdash;and in the exaggeration of anguish, and the optical illusionof consternation, all that might have corrected and restrained thisimpression was effaced, and society, and the human race, and the universewere, henceforth, summed up in his eyes, in one simple and terriblefeature,&mdash;thus the penal laws, the thing judged, the force due tolegislation, the decrees of the sovereign courts, the magistracy, thegovernment, prevention, repression, official cruelty, wisdom, legalinfallibility, the principle of authority, all the dogmas on which restpolitical and civil security, sovereignty, justice, public truth, all thiswas rubbish, a shapeless mass, chaos; he himself, Javert, the spy oforder, incorruptibility in the service of the police, the bull-dogprovidence of society, vanquished and hurled to earth; and, erect, at thesummit of all that ruin, a man with a green cap on his head and a haloround his brow; this was the astounding confusion to which he had come;this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul.</p><p>Was this to be endured? No.</p><p>A violent state, if ever such existed. There were only two ways ofescaping from it. One was to go resolutely to Jean Valjean, and restore tohis cell the convict from the galleys. The other....</p><p>Javert quitted the parapet, and, with head erect this time, betookhimself, with a firm tread, towards the station-house indicated by alantern at one of the corners of the Place du Châtelet.</p><p>On arriving there, he saw through the window a sergeant of police, and heentered. Policemen recognize each other by the very way in which they openthe door of a station-house. Javert mentioned his name, showed his card tothe sergeant, and seated himself at the table of the post on which acandle was burning. On a table lay a pen, a leaden inkstand and paper,provided in the event of possible reports and the orders of the nightpatrols. This table, still completed by its straw-seated chair, is aninstitution; it exists in all police stations; it is invariably ornamentedwith a box-wood saucer filled with sawdust and a wafer box of cardboardfilled with red wafers, and it forms the lowest stage of official style.It is there that the literature of the State has its beginning.</p><p>Javert took a pen and a sheet of paper, and began to write. This is whathe wrote:</p><p class="center">A FEW OBSERVATIONS FOR THE GOOD OF THE SERVICE.</p><p class="letter">&ldquo;In the first place: I beg Monsieur le Préfet to cast his eyes onthis.<br/>    &ldquo;Secondly: prisoners, on arriving after examination, take off theirshoes and stand barefoot on the flagstones while they are being searched. Manyof them cough on their return to prison. This entails hospital expenses.<br/>    &ldquo;Thirdly: the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of policeagents from distance to distance, is good, but, on important occasions, it isrequisite that at least two agents should never lose sight of each other, sothat, in case one agent should, for any cause, grow weak in his service, theother may supervise him and take his place.<br/>    &ldquo;Fourthly: it is inexplicable why the special regulation of theprison of the Madelonettes interdicts the prisoner from having a chair, even bypaying for it.<br/>    &ldquo;Fifthly: in the Madelonettes there are only two bars to thecanteen, so that the canteen woman can touch the prisoners with her hand.<br/>    &ldquo;Sixthly: the prisoners called barkers, who summon the otherprisoners to the parlor, force the prisoner to pay them two sous to call hisname distinctly. This is a theft.<br/>    &ldquo;Seventhly: for a broken thread ten sous are withheld in the weavingshop; this is an abuse of the contractor, since the cloth is none the worse forit.<br/>    &ldquo;Eighthly: it is annoying for visitors to La Force to be obliged totraverse the boys&rsquo; court in order to reach the parlor ofSainte-Marie-l&rsquo;Égyptienne.<br/>    &ldquo;Ninthly: it is a fact that any day gendarmes can be overheardrelating in the court-yard of the prefecture the interrogations put by themagistrates to prisoners. For a gendarme, who should be sworn to secrecy, torepeat what he has heard in the examination room is a grave disorder.<br/>    &ldquo;Tenthly: Mme. Henry is an honest woman; her canteen is very neat;but it is bad to have a woman keep the wicket to the mouse-trap of the secretcells. This is unworthy of the Conciergerie of a great civilization.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert wrote these lines in his calmest and most correct chirography,not omitting a single comma, and making the paper screech under his pen.Below the last line he signed:</p><p class="right">&ldquo;JAVERT,<br/>&ldquo;Inspector of the 1st class.</p><p class="letter">&ldquo;The Post of the Place du Châtelet.<br/>    &ldquo;June 7th, 1832, about one o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rdquo;</p><p>Javert dried the fresh ink on the paper, folded it like a letter, sealedit, wrote on the back: <i>Note for the administration</i>, left it on the table,and quitted the post. The glazed and grated door fell to behind him.</p><p>Again he traversed the Place du Châtelet diagonally, regained the quay,and returned with automatic precision to the very point which he hadabandoned a quarter of an hour previously, leaned on his elbows and foundhimself again in the same attitude on the same paving-stone of theparapet. He did not appear to have stirred.</p><p>The darkness was complete. It was the sepulchral moment which followsmidnight. A ceiling of clouds concealed the stars. Not a single lightburned in the houses of the city; no one was passing; all of the streetsand quays which could be seen were deserted; Notre-Dame and the towers ofthe Court-House seemed features of the night. A street lantern reddenedthe margin of the quay. The outlines of the bridges lay shapeless in themist one behind the other. Recent rains had swollen the river.</p><p>The spot where Javert was leaning was, it will be remembered, situatedprecisely over the rapids of the Seine, perpendicularly above thatformidable spiral of whirlpools which loose and knot themselves again likean endless screw.</p><p>Javert bent his head and gazed. All was black. Nothing was to bedistinguished. A sound of foam was audible; but the river could not beseen. At moments, in that dizzy depth, a gleam of light appeared, andundulated vaguely, water possessing the power of taking light, no oneknows whence, and converting it into a snake. The light vanished, and allbecame indistinct once more. Immensity seemed thrown open there. What laybelow was not water, it was a gulf. The wall of the quay, abrupt,confused, mingled with the vapors, instantly concealed from sight,produced the effect of an escarpment of the infinite. Nothing was to beseen, but the hostile chill of the water and the stale odor of the wetstones could be felt. A fierce breath rose from this abyss. The flood inthe river, divined rather than perceived, the tragic whispering of thewaves, the melancholy vastness of the arches of the bridge, the imaginablefall into that gloomy void, into all that shadow was full of horror.</p><p>Javert remained motionless for several minutes, gazing at this opening ofshadow; he considered the invisible with a fixity that resembledattention. The water roared. All at once he took off his hat and placed iton the edge of the quay. A moment later, a tall black figure, which abelated passer-by in the distance might have taken for a phantom, appearederect upon the parapet of the quay, bent over towards the Seine, then drewitself up again, and fell straight down into the shadows; a dull splashfollowed; and the shadow alone was in the secret of the convulsions ofthat obscure form which had disappeared beneath the water.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0394" id="link2H_4_0394"></a>BOOK FIFTH&mdash;GRANDSON AND GRANDFATHER</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0342" id="link2HCH0342"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;IN WHICH THE TREE WITH THE ZINC PLASTER APPEARS AGAIN</h3><p>Some time after the events which we have just recorded, Sieur Boulatruelleexperienced a lively emotion.</p><p>Sieur Boulatruelle was that road-mender of Montfermeil whom the reader hasalready seen in the gloomy parts of this book.</p><p>Boulatruelle, as the reader may, perchance, recall, was a man who wasoccupied with divers and troublesome matters. He broke stones and damagedtravellers on the highway.</p><p>Road-mender and thief as he was, he cherished one dream; he believed inthe treasures buried in the forest of Montfermeil. He hoped some day tofind the money in the earth at the foot of a tree; in the meanwhile, helived to search the pockets of passers-by.</p><p>Nevertheless, for an instant, he was prudent. He had just escaped neatly.He had been, as the reader is aware, picked up in Jondrette&rsquo;s garret incompany with the other ruffians. Utility of a vice: his drunkenness hadbeen his salvation. The authorities had never been able to make outwhether he had been there in the quality of a robber or a man who had beenrobbed. An order of <i>nolle prosequi</i>, founded on his well authenticatedstate of intoxication on the evening of the ambush, had set him atliberty. He had taken to his heels. He had returned to his road from Gagnyto Lagny, to make, under administrative supervision, broken stone for thegood of the state, with downcast mien, in a very pensive mood, his ardorfor theft somewhat cooled; but he was addicted nonetheless tenderly tothe wine which had recently saved him.</p><p>As for the lively emotion which he had experienced a short time after hisreturn to his road-mender&rsquo;s turf-thatched cot, here it is:</p><p>One morning, Boulatruelle, while on his way as was his wont, to his work,and possibly also to his ambush, a little before daybreak caught sight,through the branches of the trees, of a man, whose back alone he saw, butthe shape of whose shoulders, as it seemed to him at that distance and inthe early dusk, was not entirely unfamiliar to him. Boulatruelle, althoughintoxicated, had a correct and lucid memory, a defensive arm that isindispensable to any one who is at all in conflict with legal order.</p><p>&ldquo;Where the deuce have I seen something like that man yonder?&rdquo; he said tohimself. But he could make himself no answer, except that the manresembled some one of whom his memory preserved a confused trace.</p><p>However, apart from the identity which he could not manage to catch,Boulatruelle put things together and made calculations. This man did notbelong in the country-side. He had just arrived there. On foot, evidently.No public conveyance passes through Montfermeil at that hour. He hadwalked all night. Whence came he? Not from a very great distance; for hehad neither haversack, nor bundle. From Paris, no doubt. Why was he inthese woods? why was he there at such an hour? what had he come there for?</p><p>Boulatruelle thought of the treasure. By dint of ransacking his memory, herecalled in a vague way that he had already, many years before, had asimilar alarm in connection with a man who produced on him the effect thathe might well be this very individual.</p><p>&ldquo;By the deuce,&rdquo; said Boulatruelle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find him again. I&rsquo;ll discover theparish of that parishioner. This prowler of Patron-Minette has a reason,and I&rsquo;ll know it. People can&rsquo;t have secrets in my forest if I don&rsquo;t have afinger in the pie.&rdquo;</p><p>He took his pick-axe which was very sharply pointed.</p><p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; he grumbled, &ldquo;is something that will search the earth and aman.&rdquo;</p><p>And, as one knots one thread to another thread, he took up the line ofmarch at his best pace in the direction which the man must follow, and setout across the thickets.</p><p>When he had compassed a hundred strides, the day, which was alreadybeginning to break, came to his assistance. Footprints stamped in thesand, weeds trodden down here and there, heather crushed, young branchesin the brushwood bent and in the act of straightening themselves up againwith the graceful deliberation of the arms of a pretty woman who stretchesherself when she wakes, pointed out to him a sort of track. He followedit, then lost it. Time was flying. He plunged deeper into the woods andcame to a sort of eminence. An early huntsman who was passing in thedistance along a path, whistling the air of Guillery, suggested to him theidea of climbing a tree. Old as he was, he was agile. There stood close athand a beech-tree of great size, worthy of Tityrus and of Boulatruelle.Boulatruelle ascended the beech as high as he was able.</p><p>The idea was a good one. On scrutinizing the solitary waste on the sidewhere the forest is thoroughly entangled and wild, Boulatruelle suddenlycaught sight of his man.</p><p>Hardly had he got his eye upon him when he lost sight of him.</p><p>The man entered, or rather, glided into, an open glade, at a considerabledistance, masked by large trees, but with which Boulatruelle was perfectlyfamiliar, on account of having noticed, near a large pile of porousstones, an ailing chestnut-tree bandaged with a sheet of zinc naileddirectly upon the bark. This glade was the one which was formerly calledthe Blaru-bottom. The heap of stones, destined for no one knows whatemployment, which was visible there thirty years ago, is doubtless stillthere. Nothing equals a heap of stones in longevity, unless it is a boardfence. They are temporary expedients. What a reason for lasting!</p><p>Boulatruelle, with the rapidity of joy, dropped rather than descended fromthe tree. The lair was unearthed, the question now was to seize the beast.That famous treasure of his dreams was probably there.</p><p>It was no small matter to reach that glade. By the beaten paths, whichindulge in a thousand teasing zigzags, it required a good quarter of anhour. In a bee-line, through the underbrush, which is peculiarly dense,very thorny, and very aggressive in that locality, a full half hour wasnecessary. Boulatruelle committed the error of not comprehending this. Hebelieved in the straight line; a respectable optical illusion which ruinsmany a man.

For many weeks he layin a fever accompanied by delirium, and by tolerably grave cerebralsymptoms, caused more by the shocks of the wounds on the head than by thewounds themselves.</p><p>He repeated Cosette&rsquo;s name for whole nights in the melancholy loquacity offever, and with the sombre obstinacy of agony. The extent of some of thelesions presented a serious danger, the suppuration of large wounds beingalways liable to become re-absorbed, and consequently, to kill the sickman, under certain atmospheric conditions; at every change of weather, atthe slightest storm, the physician was uneasy.</p><p>&ldquo;Above all things,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;let the wounded man be subjected to noemotion.&rdquo; The dressing of the wounds was complicated and difficult, thefixation of apparatus and bandages by cerecloths not having been inventedas yet, at that epoch. Nicolette used up a sheet &ldquo;as big as the ceiling,&rdquo; as she put it, for lint. It was not without difficulty that thechloruretted lotions and the nitrate of silver overcame the gangrene. Aslong as there was any danger, M. Gillenormand, seated in despair at hisgrandson&rsquo;s pillow, was, like Marius, neither alive nor dead.</p><p>Every day, sometimes twice a day, a very well dressed gentleman with whitehair,&mdash;such was the description given by the porter,&mdash;came toinquire about the wounded man, and left a large package of lint for thedressings.</p><p>Finally, on the 7th of September, four months to a day, after thesorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather in adying condition, the doctor declared that he would answer for Marius.Convalescence began. But Marius was forced to remain for two months morestretched out on a long chair, on account of the results called up by thefracture of his collar-bone. There always is a last wound like that whichwill not close, and which prolongs the dressings indefinitely, to thegreat annoyance of the sick person.</p><p>However, this long illness and this long convalescence saved him from allpursuit. In France, there is no wrath, not even of a public character,which six months will not extinguish. Revolts, in the present state ofsociety, are so much the fault of every one, that they are followed by acertain necessity of shutting the eyes.</p><p>Let us add, that the inexcusable Gisquet order, which enjoined doctors tolodge information against the wounded, having outraged public opinion, andnot opinion alone, but the King first of all, the wounded were covered andprotected by this indignation; and, with the exception of those who hadbeen made prisoners in the very act of combat, the councils of war did notdare to trouble any one. So Marius was left in peace.</p><p>M. Gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish, and thenthrough every form of ecstasy. It was found difficult to prevent hispassing every night beside the wounded man; he had his big armchaircarried to Marius&rsquo; bedside; he required his daughter to take the finestlinen in the house for compresses and bandages. Mademoiselle Gillenormand,like a sage and elderly person, contrived to spare the fine linen, whileallowing the grandfather to think that he was obeyed. M. Gillenormandwould not permit any one to explain to him, that for the preparation oflint batiste is not nearly so good as coarse linen, nor new linen as oldlinen. He was present at all the dressings of the wounds from whichMademoiselle Gillenormand modestly absented herself. When the dead fleshwas cut away with scissors, he said: &ldquo;Aïe! aïe!&rdquo; Nothing was more touchingthan to see him with his gentle, senile palsy, offer the wounded man a cupof his cooling-draught. He overwhelmed the doctor with questions. He didnot observe that he asked the same ones over and over again.</p><p>On the day when the doctor announced to him that Marius was out of danger,the good man was in a delirium. He made his porter a present of threelouis. That evening, on his return to his own chamber, he danced agavotte, using his thumb and forefinger as castanets, and he sang thefollowing song:</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Jeanne est née à Fougère<br/>Vrai nid d&rsquo;une bergère;<br/>J&rsquo;adore son jupon,<br/>        Fripon.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Amour, tu vis en elle;<br/>Car c&rsquo;est dans sa prunelle<br/>Que tu mets ton carquois.<br/>        Narquois!<br/><br/>&ldquo;Moi, je la chante, et j&rsquo;aime,<br/>Plus que Diane même,<br/>Jeanne et ses durs tetons<br/>        Bretons.&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-61" name="linknoteref-61" id="linknoteref-61">61</a></p><p>Then he knelt upon a chair, and Basque, who was watching him through thehalf-open door, made sure that he was praying.</p><p>Up to that time, he had not believed in God.</p><p>At each succeeding phase of improvement, which became more and morepronounced, the grandfather raved. He executed a multitude of mechanicalactions full of joy; he ascended and descended the stairs, without knowingwhy. A pretty female neighbor was amazed one morning at receiving a bigbouquet; it was M. Gillenormand who had sent it to her. The husband made ajealous scene. M. Gillenormand tried to draw Nicolette upon his knees. Hecalled Marius, &ldquo;M. le Baron.&rdquo; He shouted: &ldquo;Long live the Republic!&rdquo;</p><p>Every moment, he kept asking the doctor: &ldquo;Is he no longer in danger?&rdquo; Hegazed upon Marius with the eyes of a grandmother. He brooded over himwhile he ate. He no longer knew himself, he no longer rendered himself anaccount of himself. Marius was the master of the house, there wasabdication in his joy, he was the grandson of his grandson.</p><p>In the state of joy in which he then was, he was the most venerable ofchildren. In his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent, hestepped behind him to smile. He was content, joyous, delighted, charming,young. His white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay radiance of hisvisage. When grace is mingled with wrinkles, it is adorable. There is anindescribable aurora in beaming old age.</p><p>As for Marius, as he allowed them to dress his wounds and care for him, hehad but one fixed idea: Cosette.</p><p>After the fever and delirium had left him, he did not again pronounce hername, and it might have been supposed that he no longer thought of her. Heheld his peace, precisely because his soul was there.</p><p>He did not know what had become of Cosette; the whole affair of the Rue dela Chanvrerie was like a cloud in his memory; shadows that were almostindistinct, floated through his mind, Éponine, Gavroche, Mabeuf, theThénardiers, all his friends gloomily intermingled with the smoke of thebarricade; the strange passage of M. Fauchelevent through that adventureproduced on him the effect of a puzzle in a tempest; he understood nothingconnected with his own life, he did not know how nor by whom he had beensaved, and no one of those around him knew this; all that they had beenable to tell him was, that he had been brought home at night in ahackney-coach, to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; past, present, futurewere nothing more to him than the mist of a vague idea; but in that fogthere was one immovable point, one clear and precise outline, somethingmade of granite, a resolution, a will; to find Cosette once more. For him,the idea of life was not distinct from the idea of Cosette. He had decreedin his heart that he would not accept the one without the other, and hewas immovably resolved to exact of any person whatever, who should desireto force him to live,&mdash;from his grandfather, from fate, from hell,&mdash;therestitution of his vanished Eden.</p><p>He did not conceal from himself the fact that obstacles existed.</p><p>Let us here emphasize one detail, he was not won over and was but littlesoftened by all the solicitude and tenderness of his grandfather. In thefirst place, he was not in the secret; then, in his reveries of aninvalid, which were still feverish, possibly, he distrusted thistenderness as a strange and novel thing, which had for its object hisconquest. He remained cold. The grandfather absolutely wasted his poor oldsmile. Marius said to himself that it was all right so long as he, Marius,did not speak, and let things take their course; but that when it became aquestion of Cosette, he would find another face, and that hisgrandfather&rsquo;s true attitude would be unmasked. Then there would be anunpleasant scene; a recrudescence of family questions, a confrontation ofpositions, every sort of sarcasm and all manner of objections at one andthe same time, Fauchelevent, Coupelevent, fortune, poverty, a stone abouthis neck, the future. Violent resistance; conclusion: a refusal. Mariusstiffened himself in advance.</p><p>And then, in proportion as he regained life, the old ulcers of his memoryopened once more, he reflected again on the past, Colonel Pontmercy placedhimself once more between M. Gillenormand and him, Marius, he told himselfthat he had no true kindness to expect from a person who had been sounjust and so hard to his father. And with health, there returned to him asort of harshness towards his grandfather. The old man was gently painedby this. M. Gillenormand, without however allowing it to appear, observedthat Marius, ever since the latter had been brought back to him and hadregained consciousness, had not once called him father. It is true that hedid not say &ldquo;monsieur&rdquo; to him; but he contrived not to say either the oneor the other, by means of a certain way of turning his phrases. Obviously,a crisis was approaching.</p><p>As almost always happens in such cases, Marius skirmished before givingbattle, by way of proving himself. This is called &ldquo;feeling the ground.&rdquo; One morning it came to pass that M. Gillenormand spoke slightingly of theConvention, apropos of a newspaper which had fallen into his hands, andgave vent to a Royalist harangue on Danton, Saint-Juste and Robespierre.&mdash;&ldquo;Themen of &rsquo;93 were giants,&rdquo; said Marius with severity. The old man held hispeace, and uttered not a sound during the remainder of that day.</p><p>Marius, who had always present to his mind the inflexible grandfather ofhis early years, interpreted this silence as a profound concentration ofwrath, augured from it a hot conflict, and augmented his preparations forthe fray in the inmost recesses of his mind.</p><p>He decided that, in case of a refusal, he would tear off his bandages,dislocate his collar-bone, that he would lay bare all the wounds which hehad left, and would reject all food. His wounds were his munitions of war.He would have Cosette or die.</p><p>He awaited the propitious moment with the crafty patience of the sick.</p><p>That moment arrived.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0344" id="link2HCH0344"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;MARIUS ATTACKED</h3><p>One day, M. Gillenormand, while his daughter was putting in order thephials and cups on the marble of the commode, bent over Marius and said tohim in his tenderest accents: &ldquo;Look here, my little Marius, if I were inyour place, I would eat meat now in preference to fish. A fried sole isexcellent to begin a convalescence with, but a good cutlet is needed toput a sick man on his feet.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius, who had almost entirely recovered his strength, collected thewhole of it, drew himself up into a sitting posture, laid his two clenchedfists on the sheets of his bed, looked his grandfather in the face,assumed a terrible air, and said:</p><p>&ldquo;This leads me to say something to you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That I wish to marry.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said his grandfather.&mdash;And he burst out laughing.</p><p>&ldquo;How agreed?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, agreed. You shall have your little girl.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius, stunned and overwhelmed with the dazzling shock, trembled in everylimb.</p><p>M. Gillenormand went on:</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you shall have her, that pretty little girl of yours. She comesevery day in the shape of an old gentleman to inquire after you. Eversince you were wounded, she has passed her time in weeping and makinglint. I have made inquiries. She lives in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé, No. 7.Ah! There we have it! Ah! so you want her! Well, you shall have her.You&rsquo;re caught. You had arranged your little plot, you had said toyourself:&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to signify this squarely to my grandfather, tothat mummy of the Regency and of the Directory, to that ancient beau, tothat Dorante turned Géronte; he has indulged in his frivolities also, thathe has, and he has had his love affairs, and his grisettes and hisCosettes; he has made his rustle, he has had his wings, he has eaten ofthe bread of spring; he certainly must remember it.&rsquo; Ah! you take thecockchafer by the horns. That&rsquo;s good. I offer you a cutlet and you answerme: &lsquo;By the way, I want to marry.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s a transition for you! Ah! youreckoned on a bickering! You do not know that I am an old coward. What doyou say to that? You are vexed? You did not expect to find yourgrandfather still more foolish than yourself, you are wasting thediscourse which you meant to bestow upon me, Mr. Lawyer, and that&rsquo;svexatious. Well, so much the worse, rage away. I&rsquo;ll do whatever you wish,and that cuts you short, imbecile! Listen. I have made my inquiries, I&rsquo;mcunning too; she is charming, she is discreet, it is not true about thelancer, she has made heaps of lint, she&rsquo;s a jewel, she adores you, if youhad died, there would have been three of us, her coffin would haveaccompanied mine. I have had an idea, ever since you have been better, ofsimply planting her at your bedside, but it is only in romances that younggirls are brought to the bedsides of handsome young wounded men whointerest them. It is not done. What would your aunt have said to it? Youwere nude three quarters of the time, my good fellow. Ask Nicolette, whohas not left you for a moment, if there was any possibility of having awoman here. And then, what would the doctor have said? A pretty girl doesnot cure a man of fever. In short, it&rsquo;s all right, let us say no moreabout it, all&rsquo;s said, all&rsquo;s done, it&rsquo;s all settled, take her. Such is myferocity. You see, I perceived that you did not love me. I said to myself:‘Here now, I have my little Cosette right under my hand, I&rsquo;m going to giveher to him, he will be obliged to love me a little then, or he must tellthe reason why.&rsquo; Ah! so you thought that the old man was going to storm,to put on a big voice, to shout no, and to lift his cane at all thataurora. Not a bit of it. Cosette, so be it; love, so be it; I ask nothingbetter. Pray take the trouble of getting married, sir. Be happy, mywell-beloved child.&rdquo;</p><p>That said, the old man burst forth into sobs.</p><p>And he seized Marius&rsquo; head, and pressed it with both arms against hisbreast, and both fell to weeping. This is one of the forms of supremehappiness.</p><p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, so you love me!&rdquo; said the old man.</p><p>An ineffable moment ensued. They were choking and could not speak.</p><p>At length the old man stammered:</p><p>&ldquo;Come! his mouth is unstopped at last. He has said: &lsquo;Father&rsquo; to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius disengaged his head from his grandfather&rsquo;s arms, and said gently:</p><p>&ldquo;But, father, now that I am quite well, it seems to me that I might seeher.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Agreed again, you shall see her to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why not to-day?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, to-day then. Let it be to-day. You have called me &lsquo;father&rsquo; threetimes, and it is worth it. I will attend to it. She shall be broughthither. Agreed, I tell you. It has already been put into verse. This isthe ending of the elegy of the &lsquo;Jeune Malade&rsquo; by André Chénier, by AndréChénier whose throat was cut by the ras . . . by the giants of &rsquo;93.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Gillenormand fancied that he detected a faint frown on the part ofMarius, who, in truth, as we must admit, was no longer listening to him,and who was thinking far more of Cosette than of 1793.</p><p>The grandfather, trembling at having so inopportunely introduced AndréChénier, resumed precipitately:</p><p>&ldquo;Cut his throat is not the word. The fact is that the great revolutionarygeniuses, who were not malicious, that is incontestable, who were heroes,pardi! found that André Chénier embarrassed them somewhat, and they hadhim guillot . . . that is to say, those great men on the 7th of Thermidor,besought André Chénier, in the interests of public safety, to be so goodas to go....&rdquo;</p><p>M. Gillenormand, clutched by the throat by his own phrase, could notproceed. Being able neither to finish it nor to retract it, while hisdaughter arranged the pillow behind Marius, who was overwhelmed with somany emotions, the old man rushed headlong, with as much rapidity as hisage permitted, from the bed-chamber, shut the door behind him, and,purple, choking and foaming at the mouth, his eyes starting from his head,he found himself nose to nose with honest Basque, who was blacking bootsin the anteroom. He seized Basque by the collar, and shouted full in hisface in fury:&mdash;&ldquo;By the hundred thousand Javottes of the devil, thoseruffians did assassinate him!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who, sir?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;André Chénier!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Basque in alarm.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0345" id="link2HCH0345"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND ENDS BY NO LONGER THINKING IT ABAD THING THAT M.

There are things which onemust not attempt to depict; the sun is one of them.</p><p>The entire family, including Basque and Nicolette, were assembled inMarius&rsquo; chamber at the moment when Cosette entered it.</p><p>Precisely at that moment, the grandfather was on the point of blowing hisnose; he stopped short, holding his nose in his handkerchief, and gazingover it at Cosette.</p><p>She appeared on the threshold; it seemed to him that she was surrounded bya glory.</p><p>&ldquo;Adorable!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p><p>Then he blew his nose noisily.</p><p>Cosette was intoxicated, delighted, frightened, in heaven. She was asthoroughly alarmed as any one can be by happiness. She stammered all pale,yet flushed, she wanted to fling herself into Marius&rsquo; arms, and dared not.Ashamed of loving in the presence of all these people. People are pitilesstowards happy lovers; they remain when the latter most desire to be leftalone. Lovers have no need of any people whatever.</p><p>With Cosette, and behind her, there had entered a man with white hair whowas grave yet smiling, though with a vague and heartrending smile. It was&ldquo;Monsieur Fauchelevent&rdquo;; it was Jean Valjean.</p><p>He was very well dressed, as the porter had said, entirely in black, inperfectly new garments, and with a white cravat.</p><p>The porter was a thousand leagues from recognizing in this correctbourgeois, in this probable notary, the fear-inspiring bearer of thecorpse, who had sprung up at his door on the night of the 7th of June,tattered, muddy, hideous, haggard, his face masked in blood and mire,supporting in his arms the fainting Marius; still, his porter&rsquo;s scent wasaroused. When M. Fauchelevent arrived with Cosette, the porter had notbeen able to refrain from communicating to his wife this aside: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;tknow why it is, but I can&rsquo;t help fancying that I&rsquo;ve seen that facebefore.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Fauchelevent in Marius&rsquo; chamber, remained apart near the door. He hadunder his arm, a package which bore considerable resemblance to an octavovolume enveloped in paper. The enveloping paper was of a greenish hue, andappeared to be mouldy.</p><p>&ldquo;Does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm?&rdquo; Mademoiselle Gillenormand, who did not like books, demanded in a low toneof Nicolette.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; retorted M. Gillenormand, who had overheard her, in the same tone,&ldquo;he&rsquo;s a learned man. What then? Is that his fault? Monsieur Boulard, oneof my acquaintances, never walked out without a book under his arm either,and he always had some old volume hugged to his heart like that.&rdquo;</p><p>And, with a bow, he said aloud:</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Tranchelevent....&rdquo;</p><p>Father Gillenormand did not do it intentionally, but inattention to propernames was an aristocratic habit of his.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Tranchelevent, I have the honor of asking you, on behalf of mygrandson, Baron Marius Pontmercy, for the hand of Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p><p>Monsieur Tranchelevent bowed.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; said the grandfather.</p><p>And, turning to Marius and Cosette, with both arms extended in blessing,he cried:</p><p>&ldquo;Permission to adore each other!&rdquo;</p><p>They did not require him to repeat it twice. So much the worse! thechirping began. They talked low. Marius, resting on his elbow on hisreclining chair, Cosette standing beside him. &ldquo;Oh, heavens!&rdquo; murmuredCosette, &ldquo;I see you once again! it is thou! it is you! The idea of goingand fighting like that! But why? It is horrible. I have been dead for fourmonths. Oh! how wicked it was of you to go to that battle! What had I doneto you? I pardon you, but you will never do it again. A little while ago,when they came to tell us to come to you, I still thought that I was aboutto die, but it was from joy. I was so sad! I have not taken the time todress myself, I must frighten people with my looks! What will yourrelatives say to see me in a crumpled collar? Do speak! You let me do allthe talking. We are still in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé. It seems that yourshoulder was terrible. They told me that you could put your fist in it.And then, it seems that they cut your flesh with the scissors. That isfrightful. I have cried till I have no eyes left. It is queer that aperson can suffer like that. Your grandfather has a very kindly air. Don&rsquo;tdisturb yourself, don&rsquo;t rise on your elbow, you will injure yourself. Oh!how happy I am! So our unhappiness is over! I am quite foolish. I hadthings to say to you, and I no longer know in the least what they were. Doyou still love me? We live in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé. There is no garden.I made lint all the time; stay, sir, look, it is your fault, I have acallous on my fingers.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Angel!&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p><i>Angel</i> is the only word in the language which cannot be worn out. No otherword could resist the merciless use which lovers make of it.</p><p>Then as there were spectators, they paused and said not a word more,contenting themselves with softly touching each other&rsquo;s hands.</p><p>M. Gillenormand turned towards those who were in the room and cried:</p><p>&ldquo;Talk loud, the rest of you. Make a noise, you people behind the scenes.Come, a little uproar, the deuce! so that the children can chatter attheir ease.&rdquo;</p><p>And, approaching Marius and Cosette, he said to them in a very low voice:</p><p>&ldquo;Call each other <i>thou</i>. Don&rsquo;t stand on ceremony.&rdquo;</p><p>Aunt Gillenormand looked on in amazement at this irruption of light in herelderly household. There was nothing aggressive about this amazement; itwas not the least in the world like the scandalized and envious glance ofan owl at two turtledoves, it was the stupid eye of a poor innocent sevenand fifty years of age; it was a life which had been a failure gazing atthat triumph, love.</p><p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Gillenormand senior,&rdquo; said her father to her, &ldquo;I told youthat this is what would happen to you.&rdquo;</p><p>He remained silent for a moment, and then added:</p><p>&ldquo;Look at the happiness of others.&rdquo;</p><p>Then he turned to Cosette.</p><p>&ldquo;How pretty she is! how pretty she is! She&rsquo;s a Greuze. So you are going tohave that all to yourself, you scamp! Ah! my rogue, you are getting offnicely with me, you are happy; if I were not fifteen years too old, wewould fight with swords to see which of us should have her. Come now!

Our parish is Saint-Denis du Saint Sacrament, but I will get adispensation so that you can be married at Saint-Paul. The church isbetter. It was built by the Jesuits. It is more coquettish. It is oppositethe fountain of Cardinal de Birague. The masterpiece of Jesuitarchitecture is at Namur. It is called Saint-Loup. You must go there afteryou are married. It is worth the journey.

I really do not see the use in remaining a spinster! I know thatthey have their chapel apart in the church, and that they fall back on theSociety of the Virgin; but, sapristi, a handsome husband, a fine fellow,and at the expiration of a year, a big, blond brat who nurses lustily, andwho has fine rolls of fat on his thighs, and who musses up your breast inhandfuls with his little rosy paws, laughing the while like the dawn,&mdash;that&rsquo;sbetter than holding a candle at vespers, and chanting <i>Turris Eburnea!</i>&rdquo;</p><p>The grandfather executed a pirouette on his eighty-year-old heels, andbegan to talk again like a spring that has broken loose once more:</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Ainsi, bornant les cours de tes rêvasseries,<br/>Alcippe, il est donc vrai, dans peu tu te maries.&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-63" name="linknoteref-63" id="linknoteref-63">63</a></p><p>&ldquo;By the way!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it, father?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have not you an intimate friend?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, Courfeyrac.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What has become of him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is good.&rdquo;</p><p>He seated himself near them, made Cosette sit down, and took their fourhands in his aged and wrinkled hands:</p><p>&ldquo;She is exquisite, this darling.

More than half ofwhat I possess is swallowed up in an annuity; so long as I live, it willnot matter, but after my death, a score of years hence, ah! my poorchildren, you will not have a sou!

There were five hundred notes for athousand francs each, and one hundred and sixty-eight of five hundred. Inall, five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs.</p><p>&ldquo;This is a fine book,&rdquo; said M.

The sum, six hundred and thirtythousand francs, all in bank-bills, was not very bulky, and was containedin a box; only, in order to preserve the box from dampness, he had placedit in a coffer filled with chestnut shavings. In the same coffer he hadplaced his other treasures, the Bishop&rsquo;s candlesticks. It will beremembered that he had carried off the candlesticks when he made hisescape from Montreuil-sur-Mer. The man seen one evening for the first timeby Boulatruelle, was Jean Valjean. Later on, every time that Jean Valjeanneeded money, he went to get it in the Blaru-bottom. Hence the absenceswhich we have mentioned. He had a pickaxe somewhere in the heather, in ahiding-place known to himself alone. When he beheld Marius convalescent,feeling that the hour was at hand, when that money might prove of service,he had gone to get it; it was he again, whom Boulatruelle had seen in thewoods, but on this occasion, in the morning instead of in the evening.Boulatreulle inherited his pickaxe.</p><p>The actual sum was five hundred and eighty-four thousand, five hundredfrancs. Jean Valjean withdrew the five hundred francs for himself.&mdash;&ldquo;Weshall see hereafter,&rdquo; he thought.</p><p>The difference between that sum and the six hundred and thirty thousandfrancs withdrawn from Laffitte represented his expenditure in ten years,from 1823 to 1833. The five years of his stay in the convent had cost onlyfive thousand francs.</p><p>Jean Valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney-piece, where theyglittered to the great admiration of Toussaint.</p><p>Moreover, Jean Valjean knew that he was delivered from Javert. The storyhad been told in his presence, and he had verified the fact in the<i>Moniteur</i>, how a police inspector named Javert had been found drowned undera boat belonging to some laundresses, between the Pont au Change and thePont-Neuf, and that a writing left by this man, otherwise irreproachableand highly esteemed by his superiors, pointed to a fit of mentalaberration and a suicide.&mdash;&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; thought Jean Valjean, &ldquo;since heleft me at liberty, once having got me in his power, he must have beenalready mad.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0347" id="link2HCH0347"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE TWO OLD MEN DO EVERYTHING, EACH ONE AFTER HIS OWNFASHION, TO RENDER COSETTE HAPPY</h3><p>Everything was made ready for the wedding. The doctor, on being consulted,declared that it might take place in February. It was then December. A fewravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed.</p><p>The grandfather was not the least happy of them all. He remained for aquarter of an hour at a time gazing at Cosette.</p><p>&ldquo;The wonderful, beautiful girl!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;And she has so sweet andgood an air! she is, without exception, the most charming girl that I haveever seen in my life. Later on, she&rsquo;ll have virtues with an odor ofviolets. How graceful! one cannot live otherwise than nobly with such acreature. Marius, my boy, you are a Baron, you are rich, don&rsquo;t go topettifogging, I beg of you.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette and Marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre to paradise. Thetransition had not been softened, and they would have been stunned, hadthey not been dazzled by it.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you understand anything about it?&rdquo; said Marius to Cosette.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Cosette, &ldquo;but it seems to me that the good God is caring forus.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean did everything, smoothed away every difficulty, arrangedeverything, made everything easy. He hastened towards Cosette&rsquo;s happinesswith as much ardor, and, apparently with as much joy, as Cosette herself.</p><p>As he had been a mayor, he understood how to solve that delicate problem,with the secret of which he alone was acquainted, Cosette&rsquo;s civil status.If he were to announce her origin bluntly, it might prevent the marriage,who knows? He extricated Cosette from all difficulties. He concocted forher a family of dead people, a sure means of not encountering anyobjections. Cosette was the only scion of an extinct family; Cosette wasnot his own daughter, but the daughter of the other Fauchelevent. Twobrothers Fauchelevent had been gardeners to the convent of thePetit-Picpus. Inquiry was made at that convent; the very best informationand the most respectable references abounded; the good nuns, not very aptand but little inclined to fathom questions of paternity, and notattaching any importance to the matter, had never understood exactly ofwhich of the two Fauchelevents Cosette was the daughter. They said whatwas wanted and they said it with zeal. An <i>acte de notoriété</i> was drawn up.Cosette became in the eyes of the law, Mademoiselle EuphrasieFauchelevent. She was declared an orphan, both father and mother beingdead. Jean Valjean so arranged it that he was appointed, under the name ofFauchelevent, as Cosette&rsquo;s guardian, with M. Gillenormand as supervisingguardian over him.</p><p>As for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs, they constituted alegacy bequeathed to Cosette by a dead person, who desired to remainunknown. The original legacy had consisted of five hundred and ninety-fourthousand francs; but ten thousand francs had been expended on theeducation of Mademoiselle Euphrasie, five thousand francs of that amounthaving been paid to the convent. This legacy, deposited in the hands of athird party, was to be turned over to Cosette at her majority, or at thedate of her marriage. This, taken as a whole, was very acceptable, as thereader will perceive, especially when the sum due was half a million.There were some peculiarities here and there, it is true, but they werenot noticed; one of the interested parties had his eyes blindfolded bylove, the others by the six hundred thousand francs.</p><p>Cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom she hadso long called father. He was merely a kinsman; another Fauchelevent washer real father. At any other time this would have broken her heart. Butat the ineffable moment which she was then passing through, it cast but aslight shadow, a faint cloud, and she was so full of joy that the clouddid not last long. She had Marius. The young man arrived, the old man waseffaced; such is life.</p><p>And then, Cosette had, for long years, been habituated to seeing enigmasaround her; every being who has had a mysterious childhood is alwaysprepared for certain renunciations.</p><p>Nevertheless, she continued to call Jean Valjean: Father.</p><p>Cosette, happy as the angels, was enthusiastic over Father Gillenormand.It is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant compliments and presents.While Jean Valjean was building up for Cosette a normal situation insociety and an unassailable status, M. Gillenormand was superintending thebasket of wedding gifts. Nothing so amused him as being magnificent. Hehad given to Cosette a robe of Binche guipure which had descended to himfrom his own grandmother.</p><p>&ldquo;These fashions come up again,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ancient things are the rage, andthe young women of my old age dress like the old women of my childhood.&rdquo;</p><p>He rifled his respectable chests of drawers in Coromandel lacquer, withswelling fronts, which had not been opened for years.&mdash;&ldquo;Let us hearthe confession of these dowagers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us see what they have intheir paunches.&rdquo; He noisily violated the pot-bellied drawers of all hiswives, of all his mistresses and of all his grandmothers. Pekins, damasks,lampas, painted moires, robes of shot gros de Tours, India kerchiefsembroidered in gold that could be washed, dauphines without a right orwrong side, in the piece, Genoa and Alençon point lace, parures in antiquegoldsmith&rsquo;s work, ivory bon-bon boxes ornamented with microscopic battles,gewgaws and ribbons&mdash;he lavished everything on Cosette. Cosette,amazed, desperately in love with Marius, and wild with gratitude towardsM. Gillenormand, dreamed of a happiness without limit clothed in satin andvelvet. Her wedding basket seemed to her to be upheld by seraphim. Hersoul flew out into the azure depths, with wings of Mechlin lace.</p><p>The intoxication of the lovers was only equalled, as we have already said,by the ecstasy of the grandfather. A sort of flourish of trumpets went onin the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.</p><p>Every morning, a fresh offering of bric-à-brac from the grandfather toCosette. All possible knickknacks glittered around her.</p><p>One day Marius, who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of his bliss,said, apropos of I know not what incident:</p><p>&ldquo;The men of the revolution are so great, that they have the prestige ofthe ages, like Cato and like Phocion, and each one of them seems to me anantique memory.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Moire antique!&rdquo; exclaimed the old gentleman. &ldquo;Thanks, Marius. That isprecisely the idea of which I was in search.&rdquo;</p><p>And on the following day, a magnificent dress of tea-rose colored moireantique was added to Cosette&rsquo;s wedding presents.</p><p>From these fripperies, the grandfather extracted a bit of wisdom.</p><p>&ldquo;Love is all very well; but there must be something else to go with it.The useless must be mingled with happiness. Happiness is only thenecessary. Season that enormously with the superfluous for me. A palaceand her heart. Her heart and the Louvre. Her heart and the grandwaterworks of Versailles. Give me my shepherdess and try to make her aduchess. Fetch me Phyllis crowned with corn-flowers, and add a hundredthousand francs income. Open for me a bucolic perspective as far as youcan see, beneath a marble colonnade. I consent to the bucolic and also tothe fairy spectacle of marble and gold. Dry happiness resembles dry bread.One eats, but one does not dine. I want the superfluous, the useless, theextravagant, excess, that which serves no purpose. I remember to haveseen, in the Cathedral of Strasburg, a clock, as tall as a three-storyhouse which marked the hours, which had the kindness to indicate the hour,but which had not the air of being made for that; and which, after havingstruck midday, or midnight,&mdash;midday, the hour of the sun, ormidnight, the hour of love,&mdash;or any other hour that you like, gaveyou the moon and the stars, the earth and the sea, birds and fishes,Phœbus and Phœbe, and a host of things which emerged from a niche, andthe twelve apostles, and the Emperor Charles the Fifth, and Éponine, andSabinus, and a throng of little gilded goodmen, who played on the trumpetto boot. Without reckoning delicious chimes which it sprinkled through theair, on every occasion, without any one&rsquo;s knowing why. Is a petty baldclock-face which merely tells the hour equal to that? For my part, I am ofthe opinion of the big clock of Strasburg, and I prefer it to the cuckooclock from the Black Forest.&rdquo;</p><p>M. Gillenormand talked nonsense in connection with the wedding, and allthe fripperies of the eighteenth century passed pell-mell through hisdithyrambs.</p><p>&ldquo;You are ignorant of the art of festivals. You do not know how to organizea day of enjoyment in this age,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Your nineteenth century isweak. It lacks excess. It ignores the rich, it ignores the noble. Ineverything it is clean-shaven. Your third estate is insipid, colorless,odorless, and shapeless. The dreams of your bourgeois who set up, as theyexpress it: a pretty boudoir freshly decorated, violet, ebony and calico.Make way! Make way! the Sieur Curmudgeon is marrying MademoiselleClutch-penny. Sumptuousness and splendor. A louis d&rsquo;or has been stuck to acandle. There&rsquo;s the epoch for you. My demand is that I may flee from itbeyond the Sarmatians. Ah! in 1787, I predict that all was lost, from theday when I beheld the Duc de Rohan, Prince de Léon, Duc de Chabot, Duc deMontbazon, Marquis de Soubise, Vicomte de Thouars, peer of France, go toLongchamps in a tapecu! That has borne its fruits. In this century, menattend to business, they gamble on &rsquo;Change, they win money, they arestingy. People take care of their surfaces and varnish them; every one isdressed as though just out of a bandbox, washed, soaped, scraped, shaved,combed, waked, smoothed, rubbed, brushed, cleaned on the outside,irreproachable, polished as a pebble, discreet, neat, and at the sametime, death of my life, in the depths of their consciences they havedung-heaps and cesspools that are enough to make a cow-herd who blows hisnose in his fingers, recoil. I grant to this age the device: &lsquo;DirtyCleanliness.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t be vexed, Marius, give me permission to speak; I sayno evil of the people as you see, I am always harping on your people, butdo look favorably on my dealing a bit of a slap to the bourgeoisie. Ibelong to it. He who loves well lashes well. Thereupon, I say plainly,that nowadays people marry, but that they no longer know how to marry.Ah! it is true, I regret the grace of the ancient manners. I regreteverything about them, their elegance, their chivalry, those courteous anddelicate ways, that joyous luxury which every one possessed, music formingpart of the wedding, a symphony above stairs, a beating of drums belowstairs, the dances, the joyous faces round the table, the fine-spungallant compliments, the songs, the fireworks, the frank laughter, thedevil&rsquo;s own row, the huge knots of ribbon. I regret the bride&rsquo;s garter.The bride&rsquo;s garter is cousin to the girdle of Venus. On what does the warof Troy turn? On Helen&rsquo;s garter, parbleu! Why did they fight, why didDiomed the divine break over the head of Meriones that great brazen helmetof ten points? why did Achilles and Hector hew each other up with vastblows of their lances? Because Helen allowed Paris to take her garter.With Cosette&rsquo;s garter, Homer would construct the <i>Iliad</i>. He would put inhis poem, a loquacious old fellow, like me, and he would call him Nestor.My friends, in bygone days, in those amiable days of yore, people marriedwisely; they had a good contract, and then they had a good carouse. Assoon as Cujas had taken his departure, Gamacho entered. But, in sooth! thestomach is an agreeable beast which demands its due, and which wants tohave its wedding also. People supped well, and had at table a beautifulneighbor without a guimpe so that her throat was only moderatelyconcealed. Oh! the large laughing mouths, and how gay we were in thosedays! youth was a bouquet; every young man terminated in a branch oflilacs or a tuft of roses; whether he was a shepherd or a warrior; and if,by chance, one was a captain of dragoons, one found means to call oneselfFlorian. People thought much of looking well. They embroidered and tintedthemselves. A bourgeois had the air of a flower, a Marquis had the air ofa precious stone. People had no straps to their boots, they had no boots.They were spruce, shining, waved, lustrous, fluttering, dainty,coquettish, which did not at all prevent their wearing swords by theirsides. The humming-bird has beak and claws. That was the day of the<i>Galland Indies</i>. One of the sides of that century was delicate, the otherwas magnificent; and by the green cabbages! people amused themselves.To-day, people are serious. The bourgeois is avaricious, the bourgeoise isa prude; your century is unfortunate. People would drive away the Gracesas being too low in the neck. Alas! beauty is concealed as though it wereugliness. Since the revolution, everything, including the ballet-dancers,has had its trousers; a mountebank dancer must be grave; your rigadoonsare doctrinarian. It is necessary to be majestic. People would be greatlyannoyed if they did not carry their chins in their cravats. The ideal ofan urchin of twenty when he marries, is to resemble M. Royer-Collard. Anddo you know what one arrives at with that majesty? at being petty. Learnthis: joy is not only joyous; it is great. But be in love gayly then, whatthe deuce! marry, when you marry, with fever and giddiness, and tumult,and the uproar of happiness! Be grave in church, well and good. But, assoon as the mass is finished, sarpejou! you must make a dream whirl aroundthe bride. A marriage should be royal and chimerical; it should promenadeits ceremony from the cathedral of Rheims to the pagoda of Chanteloup. Ihave a horror of a paltry wedding. Ventregoulette! be in Olympus for thatone day, at least. Be one of the gods. Ah! people might be sylphs. Gamesand Laughter, argiraspides; they are stupids. My friends, every recentlymade bridegroom ought to be Prince Aldobrandini. Profit by that uniqueminute in life to soar away to the empyrean with the swans and the eagles,even if you do have to fall back on the morrow into the bourgeoisie of thefrogs. Don&rsquo;t economize on the nuptials, do not prune them of theirsplendors; don&rsquo;t scrimp on the day when you beam. The wedding is not thehousekeeping. Oh! if I were to carry out my fancy, it would be gallant,violins would be heard under the trees. Here is my programme: sky-blue andsilver. I would mingle with the festival the rural divinities, I wouldconvoke the Dryads and the Nereids. The nuptials of Amphitrite, a rosycloud, nymphs with well dressed locks and entirely naked, an Academicianoffering quatrains to the goddess, a chariot drawn by marine monsters.</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;Triton trottait devant, et tirait de sa conque<br/>Des sons si ravissants qu&rsquo;il ravissait quiconque!&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-65" name="linknoteref-65" id="linknoteref-65">65</a></p><p class="noindent">&mdash;there&rsquo;s a festive programme, there&rsquo;s a good one, or else I knownothing of such matters, deuce take it!&rdquo;</p><p>While the grandfather, in full lyrical effusion, was listening to himself,Cosette and Marius grew intoxicated as they gazed freely at each other.</p><p>Aunt Gillenormand surveyed all this with her imperturbable placidity.Within the last five or six months she had experienced a certain amount ofemotions. Marius returned, Marius brought back bleeding, Marius broughtback from a barricade, Marius dead, then living, Marius reconciled, Mariusbetrothed, Marius wedding a poor girl, Marius wedding a millionairess. Thesix hundred thousand francs had been her last surprise. Then, herindifference of a girl taking her first communion returned to her. Shewent regularly to service, told her beads, read her euchology, mumbled<i>Aves</i> in one corner of the house, while <i>I love you</i> was being whispered inthe other, and she beheld Marius and Cosette in a vague way, like twoshadows. The shadow was herself.</p><p>There is a certain state of inert asceticism in which the soul,neutralized by torpor, a stranger to that which may be designated as thebusiness of living, receives no impressions, either human, or pleasant orpainful, with the exception of earthquakes and catastrophes. Thisdevotion, as Father Gillenormand said to his daughter, corresponds to acold in the head. You smell nothing of life. Neither any bad, nor any goododor.</p><p>Moreover, the six hundred thousand francs had settled the elderlyspinster&rsquo;s indecision. Her father had acquired the habit of taking her solittle into account, that he had not consulted her in the matter ofconsent to Marius&rsquo; marriage. He had acted impetuously, according to hiswont, having, a despot-turned slave, but a single thought,&mdash;tosatisfy Marius. As for the aunt,&mdash;it had not even occurred to himthat the aunt existed, and that she could have an opinion of her own, and,sheep as she was, this had vexed her. Somewhat resentful in her inmostsoul, but impassible externally, she had said to herself: &ldquo;My father hassettled the question of the marriage without reference to me; I shallsettle the question of the inheritance without consulting him.&rdquo; She wasrich, in fact, and her father was not. She had reserved her decision onthis point. It is probable that, had the match been a poor one, she wouldhave left him poor. &ldquo;So much the worse for my nephew! he is wedding abeggar, let him be a beggar himself!&rdquo; But Cosette&rsquo;s half-million pleasedthe aunt, and altered her inward situation so far as this pair of loverswere concerned. One owes some consideration to six hundred thousandfrancs, and it was evident that she could not do otherwise than leave herfortune to these young people, since they did not need it.</p><p>It was arranged that the couple should live with the grandfather&mdash;M.Gillenormand insisted on resigning to them his chamber, the finest in thehouse. &ldquo;That will make me young again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old plan ofmine. I have always entertained the idea of having a wedding in mychamber.&rdquo;</p><p>He furnished this chamber with a multitude of elegant trifles. He had theceiling and walls hung with an extraordinary stuff, which he had by him inthe piece, and which he believed to have emanated from Utrecht with abuttercup-colored satin ground, covered with velvet auricula blossoms.&mdash;&ldquo;Itwas with that stuff,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that the bed of the Duchesse d&rsquo;Anville atla Roche-Guyon was draped.&rdquo;&mdash;On the chimney-piece, he set a littlefigure in Saxe porcelain, carrying a muff against her nude stomach.</p><p>M. Gillenormand&rsquo;s library became the lawyer&rsquo;s study, which Marius needed;a study, it will be remembered, being required by the council of theorder.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0348" id="link2HCH0348"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE EFFECTS OF DREAMS MINGLED WITH HAPPINESS</h3><p>The lovers saw each other every day. Cosette came with M. Fauchelevent.&mdash;&ldquo;Thisis reversing things,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle Gillenormand, &ldquo;to have the bridecome to the house to do the courting like this.&rdquo; But Marius&rsquo; convalescencehad caused the habit to become established, and the armchairs of the Ruedes Filles-du-Calvaire, better adapted to interviews than the straw chairsof the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé, had rooted it. Marius and M. Fauchelevent saweach other, but did not address each other. It seemed as though this hadbeen agreed upon. Every girl needs a chaperon. Cosette could not have comewithout M. Fauchelevent. In Marius&rsquo; eyes, M. Fauchelevent was thecondition attached to Cosette. He accepted it. By dint of discussingpolitical matters, vaguely and without precision, from the point of viewof the general amelioration of the fate of all men, they came to say alittle more than &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Once, on the subject of education, whichMarius wished to have free and obligatory, multiplied under all formslavished on every one, like the air and the sun in a word, respirable forthe entire population, they were in unison, and they almost conversed. M.Fauchelevent talked well, and even with a certain loftiness of language&mdash;stillhe lacked something indescribable. M. Fauchelevent possessed somethingless and also something more, than a man of the world.</p><p>Marius, inwardly, and in the depths of his thought, surrounded with allsorts of mute questions this M. Fauchelevent, who was to him simplybenevolent and cold. There were moments when doubts as to his ownrecollections occurred to him. There was a void in his memory, a blackspot, an abyss excavated by four months of agony.&mdash;Many things hadbeen lost therein. He had come to the point of asking himself whether itwere really a fact that he had seen M. Fauchelevent, so serious and socalm a man, in the barricade.</p><p>This was not, however, the only stupor which the apparitions and thedisappearances of the past had left in his mind. It must not be supposedthat he was delivered from all those obsessions of the memory which forceus, even when happy, even when satisfied, to glance sadly behind us. Thehead which does not turn backwards towards horizons that have vanishedcontains neither thought nor love. At times, Marius clasped his facebetween his hands, and the vague and tumultuous past traversed thetwilight which reigned in his brain. Again he beheld Mabeuf fall, he heardGavroche singing amid the grape-shot, he felt beneath his lips the coldbrow of Éponine; Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, Combeferre,Bossuet, Grantaire, all his friends rose erect before him, then dispersedinto thin air. Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant, charming or tragicbeings merely dreams? had they actually existed? The revolt had envelopedeverything in its smoke. These great fevers create great dreams. Hequestioned himself; he felt himself; all these vanished realities made himdizzy. Where were they all then? was it really true that all were dead? Afall into the shadows had carried off all except himself. It all seemed tohim to have disappeared as though behind the curtain of a theatre. Thereare curtains like this which drop in life. God passes on to the followingact.</p><p>And he himself&mdash;was he actually the same man? He, the poor man, wasrich; he, the abandoned, had a family; he, the despairing, was to marryCosette. It seemed to him that he had traversed a tomb, and that he hadentered into it black and had emerged from it white, and in that tomb theothers had remained. At certain moments, all these beings of the past,returned and present, formed a circle around him, and overshadowed him;then he thought of Cosette, and recovered his serenity; but nothing lessthan this felicity could have sufficed to efface that catastrophe.</p><p>M. Fauchelevent almost occupied a place among these vanished beings.Marius hesitated to believe that the Fauchelevent of the barricade was thesame as this Fauchelevent in flesh and blood, sitting so gravely besideCosette. The first was, probably, one of those nightmares occasioned andbrought back by his hours of delirium. However, the natures of both menwere rigid, no question from Marius to M. Fauchelevent was possible. Suchan idea had not even occurred to him. We have already indicated thischaracteristic detail.</p><p>Two men who have a secret in common, and who, by a sort of tacitagreement, exchange not a word on the subject, are less rare than iscommonly supposed.</p><p>Once only, did Marius make the attempt. He introduced into theconversation the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and, turning to M. Fauchelevent, hesaid to him:</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, you are acquainted with that street?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What street?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The Rue de la Chanvrerie.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have no idea of the name of that street,&rdquo; replied M. Fauchelevent, inthe most natural manner in the world.</p><p>The response which bore upon the name of the street and not upon thestreet itself, appeared to Marius to be more conclusive than it reallywas.</p><p>&ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;I have been dreaming. I have been subject to ahallucination. It was some one who resembled him. M. Fauchelevent was notthere.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0349" id="link2HCH0349"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;TWO MEN IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND</h3><p>Marius&rsquo; enchantment, great as it was, could not efface from his mind otherpre-occupations.</p><p>While the wedding was in preparation, and while awaiting the date fixedupon, he caused difficult and scrupulous retrospective researches to bemade.</p><p>He owed gratitude in various quarters; he owed it on his father&rsquo;s account,he owed it on his own.</p><p>There was Thénardier; there was the unknown man who had brought him,Marius, back to M. Gillenormand.</p><p>Marius endeavored to find these two men, not intending to marry, to behappy, and to forget them, and fearing that, were these debts of gratitudenot discharged, they would leave a shadow on his life, which promised sobrightly for the future.</p><p>It was impossible for him to leave all these arrears of suffering behindhim, and he wished, before entering joyously into the future, to obtain aquittance from the past.</p><p>That Thénardier was a villain detracted nothing from the fact that he hadsaved Colonel Pontmercy. Thénardier was a ruffian in the eyes of all theworld except Marius.</p><p>And Marius, ignorant of the real scene in the battle field of Waterloo,was not aware of the peculiar detail, that his father, so far asThénardier was concerned was in the strange position of being indebted tothe latter for his life, without being indebted to him for any gratitude.</p><p>None of the various agents whom Marius employed succeeded in discoveringany trace of Thénardier. Obliteration appeared to be complete in thatquarter. Madame Thénardier had died in prison pending the trial.Thénardier and his daughter Azelma, the only two remaining of thatlamentable group, had plunged back into the gloom. The gulf of the socialunknown had silently closed above those beings. On the surface there wasnot visible so much as that quiver, that trembling, those obscureconcentric circles which announce that something has fallen in, and thatthe plummet may be dropped.</p><p>Madame Thénardier being dead, Boulatruelle being eliminated from the case,Claquesous having disappeared, the principal persons accused havingescaped from prison, the trial connected with the ambush in the Gorbeauhouse had come to nothing.</p><p>That affair had remained rather obscure. The bench of Assizes had beenobliged to content themselves with two subordinates. Panchaud, aliasPrintanier, alias Bigrenaille, and Demi-Liard, alias Deux-Milliards, whohad been inconsistently condemned, after a hearing of both sides of thecase, to ten years in the galleys. Hard labor for life had been thesentence pronounced against the escaped and contumacious accomplices.</p><p>Thénardier, the head and leader, had been, through contumacy, likewisecondemned to death.</p><p>This sentence was the only information remaining about Thénardier, castingupon that buried name its sinister light like a candle beside a bier.</p><p>Moreover, by thrusting Thénardier back into the very remotest depths,through a fear of being re-captured, this sentence added to the density ofthe shadows which enveloped this man.</p><p>As for the other person, as for the unknown man who had saved Marius, theresearches were at first to some extent successful, then came to an abruptconclusion. They succeeded in finding the carriage which had broughtMarius to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire on the evening of the 6th ofJune.</p><p>The coachman declared that, on the 6th of June, in obedience to thecommands of a police-agent, he had stood from three o&rsquo;clock in theafternoon until nightfall on the Quai des Champs-Élysées, above the outletof the Grand Sewer; that, towards nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening, the gratingof the sewer, which abuts on the bank of the river, had opened; that a manhad emerged therefrom, bearing on his shoulders another man, who seemed tobe dead; that the agent, who was on the watch at that point, had arrestedthe living man and had seized the dead man; that, at the order of thepolice-agent, he, the coachman, had taken &ldquo;all those folks&rdquo; into hiscarriage; that they had first driven to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire;that they had there deposited the dead man; that the dead man was MonsieurMarius, and that he, the coachman, recognized him perfectly, although hewas alive &ldquo;this time&rdquo;; that afterwards, they had entered the vehicleagain, that he had whipped up his horses; a few paces from the gate of theArchives, they had called to him to halt; that there, in the street, theyhad paid him and left him, and that the police-agent had led the other manaway; that he knew nothing more; that the night had been very dark.</p><p>Marius, as we have said, recalled nothing. He only remembered that he hadbeen seized from behind by an energetic hand at the moment when he wasfalling backwards into the barricade; then, everything vanished so far ashe was concerned.</p><p>He had only regained consciousness at M. Gillenormand&rsquo;s.</p><p>He was lost in conjectures.</p><p>He could not doubt his own identity. Still, how had it come to pass that,having fallen in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, he had been picked up by thepolice-agent on the banks of the Seine, near the Pont des Invalides?</p><p>Some one had carried him from the Quartier des Halles to theChamps-Élysées. And how? Through the sewer. Unheard-of devotion!</p><p>Some one? Who?</p><p>This was the man for whom Marius was searching.</p><p>Of this man, who was his savior, nothing; not a trace; not the faintestindication.</p><p>Marius, although forced to preserve great reserve, in that direction,pushed his inquiries as far as the prefecture of police. There, no morethan elsewhere, did the information obtained lead to any enlightenment.</p><p>The prefecture knew less about the matter than did the hackney-coachman.They had no knowledge of any arrest having been made on the 6th of June atthe mouth of the Grand Sewer.</p><p>No report of any agent had been received there upon this matter, which wasregarded at the prefecture as a fable. The invention of this fable wasattributed to the coachman.</p><p>A coachman who wants a gratuity is capable of anything, even ofimagination. The fact was assured, nevertheless, and Marius could notdoubt it, unless he doubted his own identity, as we have just said.</p><p>Everything about this singular enigma was inexplicable.</p><p>What had become of that man, that mysterious man, whom the coachman hadseen emerge from the grating of the Grand Sewer bearing upon his back theunconscious Marius, and whom the police-agent on the watch had arrested inthe very act of rescuing an insurgent? What had become of the agenthimself?</p><p>Why had this agent preserved silence? Had the man succeeded in making hisescape? Had he bribed the agent? Why did this man give no sign of life toMarius, who owed everything to him? His disinterestedness was no lesstremendous than his devotion. Why had not that man appeared again? Perhapshe was above compensation, but no one is above gratitude. Was he dead? Whowas the man? What sort of a face had he? No one could tell him this.</p><p>The coachman answered: &ldquo;The night was very dark.&rdquo; Basque and Nicolette,all in a flutter, had looked only at their young master all covered withblood.</p><p>The porter, whose candle had lighted the tragic arrival of Marius, hadbeen the only one to take note of the man in question, and this is thedescription that he gave:</p><p>&ldquo;That man was terrible.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius had the blood-stained clothing which he had worn when he had beenbrought back to his grandfather preserved, in the hope that it would proveof service in his researches.</p><p>On examining the coat, it was found that one skirt had been torn in asingular way. A piece was missing.</p><p>One evening, Marius was speaking in the presence of Cosette and JeanValjean of the whole of that singular adventure, of the innumerableinquiries which he had made, and of the fruitlessness of his efforts. Thecold countenance of &ldquo;Monsieur Fauchelevent&rdquo; angered him.</p><p>He exclaimed, with a vivacity which had something of wrath in it:</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, that man, whoever he may have been, was sublime. Do you know what hedid, sir? He intervened like an archangel. He must have flung himself intothe midst of the battle, have stolen me away, have opened the sewer, havedragged me into it and have carried me through it! He must have traversedmore than a league and a half in those frightful subterranean galleries,bent over, weighed down, in the dark, in the cesspool,&mdash;more than aleague and a half, sir, with a corpse upon his back! And with what object?With the sole object of saving the corpse. And that corpse I was. He saidto himself: &lsquo;There may still be a glimpse of life there, perchance; I willrisk my own existence for that miserable spark!&rsquo; And his existence herisked not once but twenty times! And every step was a danger. The proofof it is, that on emerging from the sewer, he was arrested. Do you know,sir, that that man did all this? And he had no recompense to expect. Whatwas I? An insurgent. What was I? One of the conquered. Oh! if Cosette&rsquo;ssix hundred thousand francs were mine….&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are yours,&rdquo; interrupted Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Marius, &ldquo;I would give them all to find that man oncemore.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean remained silent.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0403" id="link2H_4_0403"></a>BOOK SIXTH&mdash;THE SLEEPLESS NIGHT</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0350" id="link2HCH0350"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE 16TH OF FEBRUARY, 1833</h3><p>The night of the 16th to the 17th of February, 1833, was a blessed night.Above its shadows heaven stood open. It was the wedding night of Mariusand Cosette.</p><p>The day had been adorable.</p><p>It had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather, a fairyspectacle, with a confusion of cherubim and Cupids over the heads of thebridal pair, a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to beplaced over a door; but it had been sweet and smiling.</p><p>The manner of marriage in 1833 was not the same as it is to-day. Francehad not yet borrowed from England that supreme delicacy of carrying offone&rsquo;s wife, of fleeing, on coming out of church, of hiding oneself withshame from one&rsquo;s happiness, and of combining the ways of a bankrupt withthe delights of the Song of Songs. People had not yet grasped to the fullthe chastity, exquisiteness, and decency of jolting their paradise in aposting-chaise, of breaking up their mystery with clic-clacs, of takingfor a nuptial bed the bed of an inn, and of leaving behind them, in acommonplace chamber, at so much a night, the most sacred of the souvenirsof life mingled pell-mell with the tête-à-tête of the conductor of thediligence and the maid-servant of the inn.</p><p>In this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now living,the mayor and his scarf, the priest and his chasuble, the law and God nolonger suffice; they must be eked out by the Postilion de Lonjumeau; ablue waistcoat turned up with red, and with bell buttons, a plaque like avantbrace, knee-breeches of green leather, oaths to the Norman horses withtheir tails knotted up, false galloons, varnished hat, long powderedlocks, an enormous whip and tall boots. France does not yet carry eleganceto the length of doing like the English nobility, and raining down on thepost-chaise of the bridal pair a hail storm of slippers trodden down atheel and of worn-out shoes, in memory of Churchill, afterwardsMarlborough, or Malbrouck, who was assailed on his wedding-day by thewrath of an aunt which brought him good luck. Old shoes and slippers donot, as yet, form a part of our nuptial celebrations; but patience, asgood taste continues to spread, we shall come to that.</p><p>In 1833, a hundred years ago, marriage was not conducted at a full trot.</p><p>Strange to say, at that epoch, people still imagined that a wedding was aprivate and social festival, that a patriarchal banquet does not spoil adomestic solemnity, that gayety, even in excess, provided it be honest,and decent, does happiness no harm, and that, in short, it is a good and avenerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies whence a family isdestined to spring, should begin at home, and that the household shouldthenceforth have its nuptial chamber as its witness.</p><p>And people were so immodest as to marry in their own homes.</p><p>The marriage took place, therefore, in accordance with this nowsuperannuated fashion, at M. Gillenormand&rsquo;s house.</p><p>Natural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is, the banns topublish, the papers to be drawn up, the mayoralty, and the church producesome complication. They could not get ready before the 16th of February.</p><p>Now, we note this detail, for the pure satisfaction of being exact, itchanced that the 16th fell on Shrove Tuesday. Hesitations, scruples,particularly on the part of Aunt Gillenormand.</p><p>&ldquo;Shrove Tuesday!&rdquo; exclaimed the grandfather, &ldquo;so much the better. There isa proverb:</p><p class="poem">&ldquo;&lsquo;Mariage un Mardi gras<br/>N&rsquo;aura point enfants ingrats.&rsquo;<a href="#linknote-66" name="linknoteref-66" id="linknoteref-66">66</a></p><p class="noindent">Let us proceed. Here goes for the 16th! Do you want to delay, Marius?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, certainly not!&rdquo; replied the lover.</p><p>&ldquo;Let us marry, then,&rdquo; cried the grandfather.</p><p>Accordingly, the marriage took place on the 16th, notwithstanding thepublic merrymaking. It rained that day, but there is always in the sky atiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness, which lovers see, evenwhen the rest of creation is under an umbrella.</p><p>On the preceding evening, Jean Valjean handed to Marius, in the presenceof M. Gillenormand, the five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs.</p><p>As the marriage was taking place under the régime of community ofproperty, the papers had been simple.</p><p>Henceforth, Toussaint was of no use to Jean Valjean; Cosette inherited herand promoted her to the rank of lady&rsquo;s maid.</p><p>As for Jean Valjean, a beautiful chamber in the Gillenormand house hadbeen furnished expressly for him, and Cosette had said to him in such anirresistible manner: &ldquo;Father, I entreat you,&rdquo; that she had almostpersuaded him to promise that he would come and occupy it.</p><p>A few days before that fixed on for the marriage, an accident happened toJean Valjean; he crushed the thumb of his right hand. This was not aserious matter; and he had not allowed any one to trouble himself aboutit, nor to dress it, nor even to see his hurt, not even Cosette.Nevertheless, this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen bandage,and to carry his arm in a sling, and had prevented his signing. M.Gillenormand, in his capacity of Cosette&rsquo;s supervising-guardian, hadsupplied his place.</p><p>We will not conduct the reader either to the mayor&rsquo;s office or to thechurch. One does not follow a pair of lovers to that extent, and one isaccustomed to turn one&rsquo;s back on the drama as soon as it puts a weddingnosegay in its buttonhole. We will confine ourselves to noting an incidentwhich, though unnoticed by the wedding party, marked the transit from theRue des Filles-du-Calvaire to the church of Saint-Paul.</p><p>At that epoch, the northern extremity of the Rue Saint-Louis was inprocess of repaving. It was barred off, beginning with the Rue duParc-Royal. It was impossible for the wedding carriages to go directly toSaint-Paul. They were obliged to alter their course, and the simplest waywas to turn through the boulevard. One of the invited guests observed thatit was Shrove Tuesday, and that there would be a jam of vehicles.&mdash;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked M. Gillenormand&mdash;&ldquo;Because of the maskers.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Capital,&rdquo; said the grandfather, &ldquo;let us go that way. These young folks are on theway to be married; they are about to enter the serious part of life. Thiswill prepare them for seeing a bit of the masquerade.&rdquo;</p><p>They went by way of the boulevard. The first wedding coach held Cosetteand Aunt Gillenormand, M. Gillenormand and Jean Valjean. Marius, stillseparated from his betrothed according to usage, did not come until thesecond. The nuptial train, on emerging from the Rue desFilles-du-Calvaire, became entangled in a long procession of vehicleswhich formed an endless chain from the Madeleine to the Bastille, and fromthe Bastille to the Madeleine. Maskers abounded on the boulevard. In spiteof the fact that it was raining at intervals, Merry-Andrew, Pantaloon andClown persisted. In the good humor of that winter of 1833, Paris haddisguised itself as Venice. Such Shrove Tuesdays are no longer to be seennowadays. Everything which exists being a scattered Carnival, there isno longer any Carnival.</p><p>The sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows withcurious spectators. The terraces which crown the peristyles of thetheatres were bordered with spectators. Besides the maskers, they staredat that procession&mdash;peculiar to Shrove Tuesday as to Longchamps,&mdash;ofvehicles of every description, citadines, tapissières, carioles,cabriolets marching in order, rigorously riveted to each other by thepolice regulations, and locked into rails, as it were. Any one in thesevehicles is at once a spectator and a spectacle. Police sergeantsmaintained, on the sides of the boulevard, these two interminable parallelfiles, moving in contrary directions, and saw to it that nothinginterfered with that double current, those two brooks of carriages,flowing, the one downstream, the other upstream, the one towards theChaussée d&rsquo;Antin, the other towards the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Thecarriages of the peers of France and of the Ambassadors, emblazoned withcoats of arms, held the middle of the way, going and coming freely.Certain joyous and magnificent trains, notably that of the BœufGras, had the same privilege. In this gayety of Paris, England cracked herwhip; Lord Seymour&rsquo;s post-chaise, harassed by a nickname from thepopulace, passed with great noise.</p><p>In the double file, along which the municipal guards galloped likesheep-dogs, honest family coaches, loaded down with great-aunts andgrandmothers, displayed at their doors fresh groups of children indisguise, Clowns of seven years of age, Columbines of six, ravishinglittle creatures, who felt that they formed an official part of the publicmirth, who were imbued with the dignity of their harlequinade, and whopossessed the gravity of functionaries.</p><p>From time to time, a hitch arose somewhere in the procession of vehicles;one or other of the two lateral files halted until the knot wasdisentangled; one carriage delayed sufficed to paralyze the whole line.Then they set out again on the march.</p><p>The wedding carriages were in the file proceeding towards the Bastille,and skirting the right side of the Boulevard. At the top of thePont-aux-Choux, there was a stoppage. Nearly at the same moment, the otherfile, which was proceeding towards the Madeleine, halted also. At thatpoint of the file there was a carriage-load of maskers.</p><p>These carriages, or to speak more correctly, these wagon-loads of maskersare very familiar to Parisians. If they were missing on a Shrove Tuesday,or at the Mid-Lent, it would be taken in bad part, and people would say:&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something behind that. Probably the ministry is about to undergoa change.&rdquo; A pile of Cassandras, Harlequins and Columbines, jolted alonghigh above the passers-by, all possible grotesquenesses, from the Turk tothe savage, Hercules supporting Marquises, fishwives who would have madeRabelais stop up his ears just as the Mænads made Aristophanes drop hiseyes, tow wigs, pink tights, dandified hats, spectacles of a grimacer,three-cornered hats of Janot tormented with a butterfly, shouts directedat pedestrians, fists on hips, bold attitudes, bare shoulders, immodestyunchained; a chaos of shamelessness driven by a coachman crowned withflowers; this is what that institution was like.</p><p>Greece stood in need of the chariot of Thespis, France stands in need ofthe hackney-coach of Vadé.</p><p>Everything can be parodied, even parody. The Saturnalia, that grimace ofantique beauty, ends, through exaggeration after exaggeration, in ShroveTuesday; and the Bacchanal, formerly crowned with sprays of vine leavesand grapes, inundated with sunshine, displaying her marble breast in adivine semi-nudity, having at the present day lost her shape under thesoaked rags of the North, has finally come to be called the Jack-pudding.</p><p>The tradition of carriage-loads of maskers runs back to the most ancientdays of the monarchy. The accounts of Louis XI. allot to the bailiff ofthe palace &ldquo;twenty sous, Tournois, for three coaches of mascarades in thecrossroads.&rdquo; In our day, these noisy heaps of creatures are accustomed tohave themselves driven in some ancient cuckoo carriage, whose imperialthey load down, or they overwhelm a hired landau, with its top thrownback, with their tumultuous groups. Twenty of them ride in a carriageintended for six. They cling to the seats, to the rumble, on the cheeks ofthe hood, on the shafts. They even bestride the carriage lamps. Theystand, sit, lie, with their knees drawn up in a knot, and their legshanging. The women sit on the men&rsquo;s laps. Far away, above the throng ofheads, their wild pyramid is visible. These carriage-loads form mountainsof mirth in the midst of the rout. Collé, Panard and Piron flow from it,enriched with slang. This carriage which has become colossal through itsfreight, has an air of conquest. Uproar reigns in front, tumult behind.People vociferate, shout, howl, there they break forth and writhe withenjoyment; gayety roars; sarcasm flames forth, joviality is flaunted likea red flag; two jades there drag farce blossomed forth into an apotheosis;it is the triumphal car of laughter.</p><p>A laughter that is too cynical to be frank. In truth, this laughter issuspicious. This laughter has a mission. It is charged with proving theCarnival to the Parisians.</p><p>These fishwife vehicles, in which one feels one knows not what shadows,set the philosopher to thinking. There is government therein. There onelays one&rsquo;s finger on a mysterious affinity between public men and publicwomen.</p><p>It certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up should give a sum total ofgayety, that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people should beenticed, that the system of spying, and serving as caryatids toprostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them, that thecrowd loves to behold that monstrous living pile of tinsel rags, halfdung, half light, roll by on four wheels howling and laughing, that theyshould clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames, that therewould be no festival for the populace, did not the police promenade intheir midst these sorts of twenty-headed hydras of joy. But what can bedone about it? These be-ribboned and be-flowered tumbrils of mire areinsulted and pardoned by the laughter of the public. The laughter of allis the accomplice of universal degradation. Certain unhealthy festivalsdisaggregate the people and convert them into the populace. And populaces,like tyrants, require buffoons. The King has Roquelaure, the populace hasthe Merry-Andrew. Paris is a great, mad city on every occasion that it isa great sublime city. There the Carnival forms part of politics. Paris,&mdash;letus confess it&mdash;willingly allows infamy to furnish it with comedy. Sheonly demands of her masters&mdash;when she has masters&mdash;one thing:&ldquo;Paint me the mud.&rdquo; Rome was of the same mind. She loved Nero. Nero was atitanic lighterman.</p><p>Chance ordained, as we have just said, that one of these shapelessclusters of masked men and women, dragged about on a vast calash, shouldhalt on the left of the boulevard, while the wedding train halted on theright. The carriage-load of masks caught sight of the wedding carriagecontaining the bridal party opposite them on the other side of theboulevard.</p><p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said a masker, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a wedding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A sham wedding,&rdquo; retorted another. &ldquo;We are the genuine article.&rdquo;</p><p>And, being too far off to accost the wedding party, and fearing also, therebuke of the police, the two maskers turned their eyes elsewhere.</p><p>At the end of another minute, the carriage-load of maskers had their handsfull, the multitude set to yelling, which is the crowd&rsquo;s caress tomasquerades; and the two maskers who had just spoken had to face thethrong with their comrades, and did not find the entire repertory ofprojectiles of the fishmarkets too extensive to retort to the enormousverbal attacks of the populace. A frightful exchange of metaphors tookplace between the maskers and the crowd.</p><p>In the meanwhile, two other maskers in the same carriage, a Spaniard withan enormous nose, an elderly air, and huge black moustache, and a gauntfishwife, who was quite a young girl, masked with a <i>loup</i>,<ahref="#linknote-67" name="linknoteref-67" id="linknoteref-67">67</a> hadalso noticed the wedding, and while their companions and the passers-bywere exchanging insults, they had held a dialogue in a low voice.</p><p>Their aside was covered by the tumult and was lost in it. The gusts ofrain had drenched the front of the vehicle, which was wide open; thebreezes of February are not warm; as the fishwife, clad in a low-neckedgown, replied to the Spaniard, she shivered, laughed and coughed.</p><p>Here is their dialogue:</p><p>&ldquo;Say, now.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What, daddy?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do you see that old cove?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What old cove?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yonder, in the first wedding-cart, on our side.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The one with his arm hung up in a black cravat?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that I know him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing that they should cut my throat, and I&rsquo;m ready to swear that Inever said either you, thou, or I, in my life, if I don&rsquo;t know thatParisian.&rdquo; [<i>pantinois</i>.]</p><p>&ldquo;Paris in Pantin to-day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can you see the bride if you stoop down?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the bridegroom?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no bridegroom in that trap.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Unless it&rsquo;s the old fellow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Try to get a sight of the bride by stooping very low.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind, that old cove who has something the matter with his paw Iknow, and that I&rsquo;m positive.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what good does it do to know him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No one can tell. Sometimes it does!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a hang for old fellows, that I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Know him, if you want to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We are in it, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where does that wedding come from?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing you ought to do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Get off of our trap and spin that wedding.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To find out where it goes, and what it is.

You know that well enough.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bought by the government for to-day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All the same, that old fellow bothers me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do the old fellows bother you? But you&rsquo;re not a young girl.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the first carriage.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the bride&rsquo;s trap.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So he is the father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What concern is that of mine?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I tell you that he&rsquo;s the father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As if he were the only father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Listen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go out otherwise than masked. Here I&rsquo;m concealed, no one knowsthat I&rsquo;m here. But to-morrow, there will be no more maskers. It&rsquo;s AshWednesday. I run the risk of being nabbed. I must sneak back into my hole.But you are free.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not particularly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;More than I am, at any rate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, what of that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You must try to find out where that wedding party went to.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where it went?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where is it going then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To the Cadran-Bleu.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In the first place, it&rsquo;s not in that direction.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well! to la Rapée.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or elsewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s free. Wedding parties are at liberty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point at all. I tell you that you must try to learn for mewhat that wedding is, who that old cove belongs to, and where that weddingpair lives.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I like that! that would be queer. It&rsquo;s so easy to find out awedding party that passed through the street on a Shrove Tuesday, a weekafterwards. A pin in a hay-mow! It ain&rsquo;t possible!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That don&rsquo;t matter. You must try. You understand me, Azelma.&rdquo;</p><p>The two files resumed their movement on both sides of the boulevard, inopposite directions, and the carriage of the maskers lost sight of the&ldquo;trap&rdquo; of the bride.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0351" id="link2HCH0351"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;JEAN VALJEAN STILL WEARS HIS ARM IN A SLING</h3><p>To realize one&rsquo;s dream. To whom is this accorded? There must be electionsfor this in heaven; we are all candidates, unknown to ourselves; theangels vote. Cosette and Marius had been elected.</p><p>Cosette, both at the mayor&rsquo;s office and at church, was dazzling andtouching. Toussaint, assisted by Nicolette, had dressed her.</p><p>Cosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta, her robe of Bincheguipure, a veil of English point, a necklace of fine pearls, a wreath oforange flowers; all this was white, and, from the midst of that whitenessshe beamed forth. It was an exquisite candor expanding and becomingtransfigured in the light. One would have pronounced her a virgin on thepoint of turning into a goddess.</p><p>Marius&rsquo; handsome hair was lustrous and perfumed; here and there, beneaththe thick curls, pale lines&mdash;the scars of the barricade&mdash;werevisible.</p><p>The grandfather, haughty, with head held high, amalgamating more than everin his toilet and his manners all the elegances of the epoch of Barras,escorted Cosette. He took the place of Jean Valjean, who, on account ofhis arm being still in a sling, could not give his hand to the bride.</p><p>Jean Valjean, dressed in black, followed them with a smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Fauchelevent,&rdquo; said the grandfather to him, &ldquo;this is a fine day.I vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows. Henceforth, there must beno sadness anywhere. Pardieu, I decree joy! Evil has no right to exist.That there should be any unhappy men is, in sooth, a disgrace to the azureof the sky. Evil does not come from man, who is good at bottom. All humanmiseries have for their capital and central government hell, otherwise,known as the Devil&rsquo;s Tuileries. Good, here I am uttering demagogicalwords! As far as I am concerned, I have no longer any political opinions;let all men be rich, that is to say, mirthful, and I confine myself tothat.&rdquo;</p><p>When, at the conclusion of all the ceremonies, after having pronouncedbefore the mayor and before the priest all possible &ldquo;yesses,&rdquo; after havingsigned the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy, after havingexchanged their rings, after having knelt side by side under the pall ofwhite moire in the smoke of the censer, they arrived, hand in hand,admired and envied by all, Marius in black, she in white, preceded by thesuisse, with the epaulets of a colonel, tapping the pavement with hishalberd, between two rows of astonished spectators, at the portals of thechurch, both leaves of which were thrown wide open, ready to enter theircarriage again, and all being finished, Cosette still could not believethat it was real. She looked at Marius, she looked at the crowd, shelooked at the sky: it seemed as though she feared that she should wake upfrom her dream. Her amazed and uneasy air added something indescribablyenchanting to her beauty. They entered the same carriage to return home,Marius beside Cosette; M. Gillenormand and Jean Valjean sat opposite them;Aunt Gillenormand had withdrawn one degree, and was in the second vehicle.</p><p>&ldquo;My children,&rdquo; said the grandfather, &ldquo;here you are, Monsieur le Baron andMadame la Baronne, with an income of thirty thousand livres.&rdquo;</p><p>And Cosette, nestling close to Marius, caressed his ear with an angelicwhisper: &ldquo;So it is true. My name is Marius. I am Madame Thou.&rdquo;</p><p>These two creatures were resplendent. They had reached that irrevocableand irrecoverable moment, at the dazzling intersection of all youth andall joy. They realized the verses of Jean Prouvaire; they were forty yearsold taken together. It was marriage sublimated; these two children weretwo lilies. They did not see each other, they did not contemplate eachother. Cosette perceived Marius in the midst of a glory; Marius perceivedCosette on an altar. And on that altar, and in that glory, the twoapotheoses mingling, in the background, one knows not how, behind a cloudfor Cosette, in a flash for Marius, there was the ideal thing, the realthing, the meeting of the kiss and the dream, the nuptial pillow. All thetorments through which they had passed came back to them in intoxication.It seemed to them that their sorrows, their sleepless nights, their tears,their anguish, their terrors, their despair, converted into caresses andrays of light, rendered still more charming the charming hour which wasapproaching; and that their griefs were but so many handmaidens who werepreparing the toilet of joy. How good it is to have suffered! Theirunhappiness formed a halo round their happiness. The long agony of theirlove was terminating in an ascension.</p><p>It was the same enchantment in two souls, tinged with voluptuousness inMarius, and with modesty in Cosette. They said to each other in low tones:&ldquo;We will go back to take a look at our little garden in the Rue Plumet.&rdquo; The folds of Cosette&rsquo;s gown lay across Marius.</p><p>Such a day is an ineffable mixture of dream and of reality. One possessesand one supposes. One still has time before one to divine. The emotion onthat day, of being at midday and of dreaming of midnight isindescribable. The delights of these two hearts overflowed upon the crowd,and inspired the passers-by with cheerfulness.</p><p>People halted in the Rue Saint-Antoine, in front of Saint-Paul, to gazethrough the windows of the carriage at the orange-flowers quivering onCosette&rsquo;s head.</p><p>Then they returned home to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. Marius,triumphant and radiant, mounted side by side with Cosette the staircase upwhich he had been borne in a dying condition. The poor, who had trooped tothe door, and who shared their purses, blessed them. There were flowerseverywhere. The house was no less fragrant than the church; after theincense, roses. They thought they heard voices carolling in the infinite;they had God in their hearts; destiny appeared to them like a ceiling ofstars; above their heads they beheld the light of a rising sun. All atonce, the clock struck. Marius glanced at Cosette&rsquo;s charming bare arm, andat the rosy things which were vaguely visible through the lace of herbodice, and Cosette, intercepting Marius&rsquo; glance, blushed to her veryhair.</p><p>Quite a number of old family friends of the Gillenormand family had beeninvited; they pressed about Cosette. Each one vied with the rest insaluting her as Madame la Baronne.</p><p>The officer, Théodule Gillenormand, now a captain, had come from Chartres,where he was stationed in garrison, to be present at the wedding of hiscousin Pontmercy. Cosette did not recognize him.</p><p>He, on his side, habituated as he was to have women consider him handsome,retained no more recollection of Cosette than of any other woman.</p><p>&ldquo;How right I was not to believe in that story about the lancer!&rdquo; saidFather Gillenormand, to himself.</p><p>Cosette had never been more tender with Jean Valjean. She was in unisonwith Father Gillenormand; while he erected joy into aphorisms and maxims,she exhaled goodness like a perfume. Happiness desires that all the worldshould be happy.</p><p>She regained, for the purpose of addressing Jean Valjean, inflections ofvoice belonging to the time when she was a little girl. She caressed himwith her smile.</p><p>A banquet had been spread in the dining-room.</p><p>Illumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning of agreat joy. Mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy. They do notconsent to be black. The night, yes; the shadows, no. If there is no sun,one must be made.</p><p>The dining-room was full of gay things. In the centre, above the white andglittering table, was a Venetian lustre with flat plates, with all sortsof colored birds, blue, violet, red, and green, perched amid the candles;around the chandelier, girandoles, on the walls, sconces with triple andquintuple branches; mirrors, silverware, glassware, plate, porcelain,faïence, pottery, gold and silversmith&rsquo;s work, all was sparkling and gay.The empty spaces between the candelabra were filled in with bouquets, sothat where there was not a light, there was a flower.</p><p>In the antechamber, three violins and a flute softly played quartettes byHaydn.</p><p>Jean Valjean had seated himself on a chair in the drawing-room, behind thedoor, the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to nearlyconceal him. A few moments before they sat down to table, Cosette came, asthough inspired by a sudden whim, and made him a deep courtesy, spreadingout her bridal toilet with both hands, and with a tenderly roguish glance,she asked him:</p><p>&ldquo;Father, are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, &ldquo;I am content!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, laugh.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean began to laugh.</p><p>A few moments later, Basque announced that dinner was served.</p><p>The guests, preceded by M. Gillenormand with Cosette on his arm, enteredthe dining-room, and arranged themselves in the proper order around thetable.</p><p>Two large armchairs figured on the right and left of the bride, the firstfor M. Gillenormand, the other for Jean Valjean. M. Gillenormand took hisseat. The other armchair remained empty.</p><p>They looked about for M. Fauchelevent.</p><p>He was no longer there.</p><p>M. Gillenormand questioned Basque.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know where M. Fauchelevent is?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied Basque, &ldquo;I do, precisely. M. Fauchelevent told me to say toyou, sir, that he was suffering, his injured hand was paining himsomewhat, and that he could not dine with Monsieur le Baron and Madame laBaronne. That he begged to be excused, that he would come to-morrow. Hehas just taken his departure.&rdquo;</p><p>That empty armchair chilled the effusion of the wedding feast for amoment. But, if M. Fauchelevent was absent, M. Gillenormand was present,and the grandfather beamed for two. He affirmed that M. Fauchelevent haddone well to retire early, if he were suffering, but that it was only aslight ailment. This declaration sufficed. Moreover, what is an obscurecorner in such a submersion of joy? Cosette and Marius were passingthrough one of those egotistical and blessed moments when no other facultyis left to a person than that of receiving happiness. And then, an ideaoccurred to M. Gillenormand.&mdash;&ldquo;Pardieu, this armchair is empty. Comehither, Marius. Your aunt will permit it, although she has a right to you.This armchair is for you. That is legal and delightful. Fortunatus besideFortunata.&rdquo;&mdash;Applause from the whole table. Marius took JeanValjean&rsquo;s place beside Cosette, and things fell out so that Cosette, whohad, at first, been saddened by Jean Valjean&rsquo;s absence, ended by beingsatisfied with it. From the moment when Marius took his place, and was thesubstitute, Cosette would not have regretted God himself. She set hersweet little foot, shod in white satin, on Marius&rsquo; foot.</p><p>The armchair being occupied, M. Fauchelevent was obliterated; and nothingwas lacking.</p><p>And, five minutes afterward, the whole table from one end to the other,was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness.</p><p>At dessert, M. Gillenormand, rising to his feet, with a glass of champagnein his hand&mdash;only half full so that the palsy of his eighty yearsmight not cause an overflow,&mdash;proposed the health of the marriedpair.</p><p>&ldquo;You shall not escape two sermons,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;This morning you hadone from the curé, this evening you shall have one from your grandfather.Listen to me; I will give you a bit of advice: Adore each other. I do notmake a pack of gyrations, I go straight to the mark, be happy. In allcreation, only the turtledoves are wise. Philosophers say: &lsquo;Moderate yourjoys.&rsquo; I say: &lsquo;Give rein to your joys.&rsquo; Be as much smitten with each otheras fiends. Be in a rage about it. The philosophers talk stuff andnonsense. I should like to stuff their philosophy down their gulletsagain. Can there be too many perfumes, too many open rose-buds, too manynightingales singing, too many green leaves, too much aurora in life? canpeople love each other too much? can people please each other too much?Take care, Estelle, thou art too pretty! Have a care, Nemorin, thou arttoo handsome! Fine stupidity, in sooth! Can people enchant each other toomuch, cajole each other too much, charm each other too much? Can one betoo much alive, too happy? Moderate your joys. Ah, indeed! Down with thephilosophers! Wisdom consists in jubilation. Make merry, let us makemerry. Are we happy because we are good, or are we good because we arehappy? Is the Sancy diamond called the Sancy because it belonged to Harleyde Sancy, or because it weighs six hundred carats? I know nothing aboutit, life is full of such problems; the important point is to possess theSancy and happiness. Let us be happy without quibbling and quirking. Letus obey the sun blindly. What is the sun? It is love. He who says love,says woman. Ah! ah! behold omnipotence&mdash;women. Ask that demagogue ofa Marius if he is not the slave of that little tyrant of a Cosette. And ofhis own free will, too, the coward! Woman! There is no Robespierre whokeeps his place but woman reigns. I am no longer Royalist except towardsthat royalty. What is Adam? The kingdom of Eve. No &rsquo;89 for Eve. There hasbeen the royal sceptre surmounted by a fleur-de-lys, there has been theimperial sceptre surmounted by a globe, there has been the sceptre ofCharlemagne, which was of iron, there has been the sceptre of Louis theGreat, which was of gold,&mdash;the revolution twisted them between itsthumb and forefinger, ha&rsquo;penny straws; it is done with, it is broken, itlies on the earth, there is no longer any sceptre, but make me arevolution against that little embroidered handkerchief, which smells ofpatchouli! I should like to see you do it. Try. Why is it so solid?Because it is a gewgaw. Ah! you are the nineteenth century? Well, whatthen? And we have been as foolish as you. Do not imagine that you haveeffected much change in the universe, because your trip-gallant is calledthe cholera-morbus, and because your <i>pourrée</i> is called the cachuca. Infact, the women must always be loved. I defy you to escape from that.These friends are our angels. Yes, love, woman, the kiss forms a circlefrom which I defy you to escape; and, for my own part, I should be onlytoo happy to re-enter it. Which of you has seen the planet Venus, thecoquette of the abyss, the Célimène of the ocean, rise in the infinite,calming all here below? The ocean is a rough Alcestis. Well, grumble as hewill, when Venus appears he is forced to smile. That brute beast submits.We are all made so. Wrath, tempest, claps of thunder, foam to the veryceiling. A woman enters on the scene, a planet rises; flat on your face!Marius was fighting six months ago; to-day he is married. That is well.Yes, Marius, yes, Cosette, you are in the right. Exist boldly for eachother, make us burst with rage that we cannot do the same, idealize eachother, catch in your beaks all the tiny blades of felicity that exist onearth, and arrange yourselves a nest for life. Pardi, to love, to beloved, what a fine miracle when one is young! Don&rsquo;t imagine that you haveinvented that. I, too, have had my dream, I, too, have meditated, I, too,have sighed; I, too, have had a moonlight soul. Love is a child sixthousand years old. Love has the right to a long white beard. Methusalemis a street arab beside Cupid. For sixty centuries men and women have gotout of their scrape by loving. The devil, who is cunning, took to hatingman; man, who is still more cunning, took to loving woman. In this way hedoes more good than the devil does him harm. This craft was discovered inthe days of the terrestrial paradise. The invention is old, my friends,but it is perfectly new. Profit by it. Be Daphnis and Chloe, while waitingto become Philemon and Baucis. Manage so that, when you are with eachother, nothing shall be lacking to you, and that Cosette may be the sunfor Marius, and that Marius may be the universe to Cosette. Cosette, letyour fine weather be the smile of your husband; Marius, let your rain beyour wife&rsquo;s tears. And let it never rain in your household. You havefilched the winning number in the lottery; you have gained the greatprize, guard it well, keep it under lock and key, do not squander it,adore each other and snap your fingers at all the rest. Believe what I sayto you. It is good sense. And good sense cannot lie. Be a religion to eachother. Each man has his own fashion of adoring God. Saperlotte! the bestway to adore God is to love one&rsquo;s wife. <i>I love thee!</i> that&rsquo;s my catechism.He who loves is orthodox. The oath of Henri IV. places sanctity somewherebetween feasting and drunkenness. Ventre-saint-gris! I don&rsquo;t belong to thereligion of that oath. Woman is forgotten in it. This astonishes me on thepart of Henri IV. My friends, long live women! I am old, they say; it&rsquo;sastonishing how much I feel in the mood to be young. I should like to goand listen to the bagpipes in the woods. Children who contrive to bebeautiful and contented,&mdash;that intoxicates me. I would like greatlyto get married, if any one would have me. It is impossible to imagine thatGod could have made us for anything but this: to idolize, to coo, to preenourselves, to be dove-like, to be dainty, to bill and coo our loves frommorn to night, to gaze at one&rsquo;s image in one&rsquo;s little wife, to be proud,to be triumphant, to plume oneself; that is the aim of life. There, letnot that displease you which we used to think in our day, when we wereyoung folks. Ah! vertu-bamboche! what charming women there were in thosedays, and what pretty little faces and what lovely lasses! I committed myravages among them. Then love each other. If people did not love eachother, I really do not see what use there would be in having anyspringtime; and for my own part, I should pray the good God to shut up allthe beautiful things that he shows us, and to take away from us and putback in his box, the flowers, the birds, and the pretty maidens. Mychildren, receive an old man&rsquo;s blessing.&rdquo;</p><p>The evening was gay, lively and agreeable. The grandfather&rsquo;s sovereigngood humor gave the key-note to the whole feast, and each person regulatedhis conduct on that almost centenarian cordiality. They danced a little,they laughed a great deal; it was an amiable wedding. Goodman Days of Yoremight have been invited to it. However, he was present in the person ofFather Gillenormand.</p><p>There was a tumult, then silence.</p><p>The married pair disappeared.</p><p>A little after midnight, the Gillenormand house became a temple.</p><p>Here we pause. On the threshold of wedding nights stands a smiling angelwith his finger on his lips.</p><p>The soul enters into contemplation before that sanctuary where thecelebration of love takes place.</p><p>There should be flashes of light athwart such houses. The joy which theycontain ought to make its escape through the stones of the walls inbrilliancy, and vaguely illuminate the gloom. It is impossible that thissacred and fatal festival should not give off a celestial radiance to theinfinite. Love is the sublime crucible wherein the fusion of the man andthe woman takes place; the being one, the being triple, the being final,the human trinity proceeds from it. This birth of two souls into one,ought to be an emotion for the gloom. The lover is the priest; theravished virgin is terrified. Something of that joy ascends to God. Wheretrue marriage is, that is to say, where there is love, the ideal entersin. A nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the shadows. If it were givento the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming visions of theupper life, it is probable that we should behold the forms of night, thewinged unknowns, the blue passers of the invisible, bend down, a throng ofsombre heads, around the luminous house, satisfied, showeringbenedictions, pointing out to each other the virgin wife gently alarmed,sweetly terrified, and bearing the reflection of human bliss upon theirdivine countenances. If at that supreme hour, the wedded pair, dazzledwith voluptuousness and believing themselves alone, were to listen, theywould hear in their chamber a confused rustling of wings. Perfecthappiness implies a mutual understanding with the angels. That dark littlechamber has all heaven for its ceiling. When two mouths, rendered sacredby love, approach to create, it is impossible that there should not be,above that ineffable kiss, a quivering throughout the immense mystery ofstars.</p><p>These felicities are the true ones. There is no joy outside of these joys.Love is the only ecstasy. All the rest weeps.</p><p>To love, or to have loved,&mdash;this suffices. Demand nothing more. Thereis no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life. To love is afulfilment.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0352" id="link2HCH0352"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE INSEPARABLE</h3><p>What had become of Jean Valjean?</p><p>Immediately after having laughed, at Cosette&rsquo;s graceful command, when noone was paying any heed to him, Jean Valjean had risen and had gained theantechamber unperceived. This was the very room which, eight monthsbefore, he had entered black with mud, with blood and powder, bringingback the grandson to the grandfather. The old wainscoting was garlandedwith foliage and flowers; the musicians were seated on the sofa on whichthey had laid Marius down. Basque, in a black coat, knee-breeches, whitestockings and white gloves, was arranging roses round all of the dishesthat were to be served. Jean Valjean pointed to his arm in its sling,charged Basque to explain his absence, and went away.</p><p>The long windows of the dining-room opened on the street. Jean Valjeanstood for several minutes, erect and motionless in the darkness, beneaththose radiant windows. He listened. The confused sounds of the banquetreached his ear. He heard the loud, commanding tones of the grandfather,the violins, the clatter of the plates, the bursts of laughter, andthrough all that merry uproar, he distinguished Cosette&rsquo;s sweet and joyousvoice.</p><p>He quitted the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, and returned to the Rue del&rsquo;Homme Armé.</p><p>In order to return thither, he took the Rue Saint-Louis, the RueCulture-Sainte-Catherine, and the Blancs-Manteaux; it was a little longer,but it was the road through which, for the last three months, he hadbecome accustomed to pass every day on his way from the Rue de l&rsquo;HommeArmé to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, in order to avoid the obstructionsand the mud in the Rue Vieille-du-Temple.</p><p>This road, through which Cosette had passed, excluded for him allpossibility of any other itinerary.</p><p>Jean Valjean entered his lodgings. He lighted his candle and mounted thestairs. The apartment was empty. Even Toussaint was no longer there. JeanValjean&rsquo;s step made more noise than usual in the chambers. All thecupboards stood open. He penetrated to Cosette&rsquo;s bedroom. There were nosheets on the bed. The pillow, covered with ticking, and without a case orlace, was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the mattress,whose covering was visible, and on which no one was ever to sleep again.All the little feminine objects which Cosette was attached to had beencarried away; nothing remained except the heavy furniture and the fourwalls. Toussaint&rsquo;s bed was despoiled in like manner. One bed only was madeup, and seemed to be waiting some one, and this was Jean Valjean&rsquo;s bed.</p><p>Jean Valjean looked at the walls, closed some of the cupboard doors, andwent and came from one room to another.</p><p>Then he sought his own chamber once more, and set his candle on a table.</p><p>He had disengaged his arm from the sling, and he used his right hand asthough it did not hurt him.</p><p>He approached his bed, and his eyes rested, was it by chance? was itintentionally? on the <i>inseparable</i> of which Cosette had been jealous, onthe little portmanteau which never left him. On his arrival in the Rue del&rsquo;Homme Armé, on the 4th of June, he had deposited it on a round tablenear the head of his bed. He went to this table with a sort of vivacity,took a key from his pocket, and opened the valise.</p><p>From it he slowly drew forth the garments in which, ten years before,Cosette had quitted Montfermeil; first the little gown, then the blackfichu, then the stout, coarse child&rsquo;s shoes which Cosette might almosthave worn still, so tiny were her feet, then the fustian bodice, which wasvery thick, then the knitted petticoat, next the apron with pockets, thenthe woollen stockings. These stockings, which still preserved the gracefulform of a tiny leg, were no longer than Jean Valjean&rsquo;s hand. All this wasblack of hue. It was he who had brought those garments to Montfermeil forher. As he removed them from the valise, he laid them on the bed. He fellto thinking. He called up memories. It was in winter, in a very cold monthof December, she was shivering, half-naked, in rags, her poor little feetwere all red in their wooden shoes. He, Jean Valjean, had made her abandonthose rags to clothe herself in these mourning habiliments. The mothermust have felt pleased in her grave, to see her daughter wearing mourningfor her, and, above all, to see that she was properly clothed, and thatshe was warm. He thought of that forest of Montfermeil; they had traversedit together, Cosette and he; he thought of what the weather had been, ofthe leafless trees, of the wood destitute of birds, of the sunless sky; itmattered not, it was charming. He arranged the tiny garments on the bed,the fichu next to the petticoat, the stockings beside the shoes, and helooked at them, one after the other. She was no taller than that, she hadher big doll in her arms, she had put her louis d&rsquo;or in the pocket of thatapron, she had laughed, they walked hand in hand, she had no one in theworld but him.</p><p>Then his venerable, white head fell forward on the bed, that stoical oldheart broke, his face was engulfed, so to speak, in Cosette&rsquo;s garments,and if any one had passed up the stairs at that moment, he would haveheard frightful sobs.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0353" id="link2HCH0353"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE IMMORTAL LIVER <a href="#linknote-68" name="linknoteref-68" id="linknoteref-68">68</a></h3><p>The old and formidable struggle, of which we have already witnessed somany phases, began once more.</p><p>Jacob struggled with the angel but one night. Alas! how many times have webeheld Jean Valjean seized bodily by his conscience, in the darkness, andstruggling desperately against it!</p><p>Unheard-of conflict! At certain moments the foot slips; at other momentsthe ground crumbles away underfoot. How many times had that conscience,mad for the good, clasped and overthrown him! How many times had the truthset her knee inexorably upon his breast! How many times, hurled to earthby the light, had he begged for mercy! How many times had that implacablespark, lighted within him, and upon him by the Bishop, dazzled him byforce when he had wished to be blind! How many times had he risen to hisfeet in the combat, held fast to the rock, leaning against sophism,dragged in the dust, now getting the upper hand of his conscience, againoverthrown by it! How many times, after an equivoque, after the speciousand treacherous reasoning of egotism, had he heard his irritatedconscience cry in his ear: &ldquo;A trip! you wretch!&rdquo; How many times had hisrefractory thoughts rattled convulsively in his throat, under the evidenceof duty! Resistance to God. Funereal sweats. What secret wounds which healone felt bleed! What excoriations in his lamentable existence! How manytimes he had risen bleeding, bruised, broken, enlightened, despair in hisheart, serenity in his soul! and, vanquished, he had felt himself theconqueror. And, after having dislocated, broken, and rent his consciencewith red-hot pincers, it had said to him, as it stood over him,formidable, luminous, and tranquil: &ldquo;Now, go in peace!&rdquo;</p><p>But on emerging from so melancholy a conflict, what a lugubrious peace,alas!</p><p>Nevertheless, that night Jean Valjean felt that he was passing through hisfinal combat.</p><p>A heart-rending question presented itself.</p><p>Predestinations are not all direct; they do not open out in a straightavenue before the predestined man; they have blind courts, impassablealleys, obscure turns, disturbing crossroads offering the choice of manyways. Jean Valjean had halted at that moment at the most perilous of thesecrossroads.</p><p>He had come to the supreme crossing of good and evil. He had that gloomyintersection beneath his eyes. On this occasion once more, as had happenedto him already in other sad vicissitudes, two roads opened out before him,the one tempting, the other alarming.</p><p>Which was he to take?</p><p>He was counselled to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious indexfinger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes on the darkness.</p><p>Once more, Jean Valjean had the choice between the terrible port and thesmiling ambush.</p><p>Is it then true? the soul may recover; but not fate. Frightful thing! anincurable destiny!</p><p>This is the problem which presented itself to him:</p><p>In what manner was Jean Valjean to behave in relation to the happiness ofCosette and Marius? It was he who had willed that happiness, it was he whohad brought it about; he had, himself, buried it in his entrails, and atthat moment, when he reflected on it, he was able to enjoy the sort ofsatisfaction which an armorer would experience on recognizing his factorymark on a knife, on withdrawing it, all smoking, from his own breast.</p><p>Cosette had Marius, Marius possessed Cosette. They had everything, evenriches. And this was his doing.</p><p>But what was he, Jean Valjean, to do with this happiness, now that itexisted, now that it was there? Should he force himself on this happiness?Should he treat it as belonging to him? No doubt, Cosette did belong toanother; but should he, Jean Valjean, retain of Cosette all that he couldretain? Should he remain the sort of father, half seen but respected,which he had hitherto been? Should he, without saying a word, bring hispast to that future? Should he present himself there, as though he had aright, and should he seat himself, veiled, at that luminous fireside?Should he take those innocent hands into his tragic hands, with a smile?Should he place upon the peaceful fender of the Gillenormand drawing-roomthose feet of his, which dragged behind them the disgraceful shadow of thelaw? Should he enter into participation in the fair fortunes of Cosetteand Marius? Should he render the obscurity on his brow and the cloud upontheirs still more dense? Should he place his catastrophe as a thirdassociate in their felicity? Should he continue to hold his peace? In aword, should he be the sinister mute of destiny beside these two happybeings?</p><p>We must have become habituated to fatality and to encounters with it, inorder to have the daring to raise our eyes when certain questions appearto us in all their horrible nakedness. Good or evil stands behind thissevere interrogation point. What are you going to do? demands the sphinx.</p><p>This habit of trial Jean Valjean possessed. He gazed intently at thesphinx.</p><p>He examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects.</p><p>Cosette, that charming existence, was the raft of this shipwreck. What washe to do? To cling fast to it, or to let go his hold?</p><p>If he clung to it, he should emerge from disaster, he should ascend againinto the sunlight, he should let the bitter water drip from his garmentsand his hair, he was saved, he should live.</p><p>And if he let go his hold?</p><p>Then the abyss.</p><p>Thus he took sad council with his thoughts. Or, to speak more correctly,he fought; he kicked furiously internally, now against his will, nowagainst his conviction.</p><p>Happily for Jean Valjean that he had been able to weep. That relieved him,possibly. But the beginning was savage. A tempest, more furious than theone which had formerly driven him to Arras, broke loose within him. Thepast surged up before him facing the present; he compared them and sobbed.The silence of tears once opened, the despairing man writhed.</p><p>He felt that he had been stopped short.</p><p>Alas! in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty, when wethus retreat step by step before our immutable ideal, bewildered, furious,exasperated at having to yield, disputing the ground, hoping for apossible flight, seeking an escape, what an abrupt and sinister resistancedoes the foot of the wall offer in our rear!</p><p>To feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle!</p><p>The invisible inexorable, what an obsession!</p><p>Then, one is never done with conscience. Make your choice, Brutus; makeyour choice, Cato. It is fathomless, since it is God. One flings into thatwell the labor of one&rsquo;s whole life, one flings in one&rsquo;s fortune, oneflings in one&rsquo;s riches, one flings in one&rsquo;s success, one flings in one&rsquo;sliberty or fatherland, one flings in one&rsquo;s well-being, one flings in one&rsquo;srepose, one flings in one&rsquo;s joy! More! more! more! Empty the vase! tip theurn! One must finish by flinging in one&rsquo;s heart.</p><p>Somewhere in the fog of the ancient hells, there is a tun like that.</p><p>Is not one pardonable, if one at last refuses! Can the inexhaustible haveany right? Are not chains which are endless above human strength? Whowould blame Sisyphus and Jean Valjean for saying: &ldquo;It is enough!&rdquo;</p><p>The obedience of matter is limited by friction; is there no limit to theobedience of the soul? If perpetual motion is impossible, can perpetualself-sacrifice be exacted?</p><p>The first step is nothing, it is the last which is difficult. What was theChampmathieu affair in comparison with Cosette&rsquo;s marriage and of thatwhich it entailed? What is a re-entrance into the galleys, compared toentrance into the void?</p><p>Oh, first step that must be descended, how sombre art thou! Oh, secondstep, how black art thou!</p><p>How could he refrain from turning aside his head this time?</p><p>Martyrdom is sublimation, corrosive sublimation. It is a torture whichconsecrates. One can consent to it for the first hour; one seats oneselfon the throne of glowing iron, one places on one&rsquo;s head the crown of hotiron, one accepts the globe of red hot iron, one takes the sceptre of redhot iron, but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned, and comesthere not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one abdicatesfrom suffering?</p><p>At length, Jean Valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion.</p><p>He weighed, he reflected, he considered the alternatives, the mysteriousbalance of light and darkness.</p><p>Should he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children, or should heconsummate his irremediable engulfment by himself? On one side lay thesacrifice of Cosette, on the other that of himself.</p><p>At what solution should he arrive? What decision did he come to?</p><p>What resolution did he take? What was his own inward definitive responseto the unbribable interrogatory of fatality? What door did he decide toopen? Which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning?Among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which was hischoice? What extremity did he accept? To which of the gulfs did he nod hishead?</p><p>His dizzy reverie lasted all night long.</p><p>He remained there until daylight, in the same attitude, bent double overthat bed, prostrate beneath the enormity of fate, crushed, perchance,alas! with clenched fists, with arms outspread at right angles, like a mancrucified who has been un-nailed, and flung face down on the earth. Therehe remained for twelve hours, the twelve long hours of a long winter&rsquo;snight, ice-cold, without once raising his head, and without uttering aword. He was as motionless as a corpse, while his thoughts wallowed on theearth and soared, now like the hydra, now like the eagle. Any one tobehold him thus motionless would have pronounced him dead; all at once heshuddered convulsively, and his mouth, glued to Cosette&rsquo;s garments, kissedthem; then it could be seen that he was alive.</p><p>Who could see? Since Jean Valjean was alone, and there was no one there.</p><p>The One who is in the shadows.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0408" id="link2H_4_0408"></a>BOOK SEVENTH&mdash;THE LAST DRAUGHT FROM THE CUP</h3><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0039" id="linkimage-0039"></a><img src="images/5b7-1-last-drop.jpg" alt="Last Drop from the Cup" width="100%" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0354" id="link2HCH0354"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE SEVENTH CIRCLE AND THE EIGHTH HEAVEN</h3><p>The days that follow weddings are solitary. People respect the meditationsof the happy pair. And also, their tardy slumbers, to some degree. Thetumult of visits and congratulations only begins later on. On the morningof the 17th of February, it was a little past midday when Basque, withnapkin and feather-duster under his arm, busy in setting his antechamberto rights, heard a light tap at the door. There had been no ring, whichwas discreet on such a day. Basque opened the door, and beheld M.Fauchelevent. He introduced him into the drawing-room, still encumberedand topsy-turvy, and which bore the air of a field of battle after thejoys of the preceding evening.</p><p>&ldquo;<i>Dame</i>, sir,&rdquo; remarked Basque, &ldquo;we all woke up late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is your master up?&rdquo; asked Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;How is Monsieur&rsquo;s arm?&rdquo; replied Basque.</p><p>&ldquo;Better. Is your master up?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which one? the old one or the new one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Pontmercy.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron,&rdquo; said Basque, drawing himself up.</p><p>A man is a Baron most of all to his servants. He counts for something withthem; they are what a philosopher would call, bespattered with the title,and that flatters them. Marius, be it said in passing, a militantrepublican as he had proved, was now a Baron in spite of himself. A smallrevolution had taken place in the family in connection with this title. Itwas now M. Gillenormand who clung to it, and Marius who detached himselffrom it. But Colonel Pontmercy had written: &ldquo;My son will bear my title.&rdquo; Marius obeyed. And then, Cosette, in whom the woman was beginning to dawn,was delighted to be a Baroness.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron?&rdquo; repeated Basque. &ldquo;I will go and see. I will tell himthat M. Fauchelevent is here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Do not tell him that it is I. Tell him that some one wishes to speakto him in private, and mention no name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; ejaculated Basque.</p><p>&ldquo;I wish to surprise him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; ejaculated Basque once more, emitting his second &ldquo;ah!&rdquo; as anexplanation of the first.</p><p>And he left the room.</p><p>Jean Valjean remained alone.</p><p>The drawing-room, as we have just said, was in great disorder. It seemedas though, by lending an ear, one might still hear the vague noise of thewedding. On the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers which had fallenfrom garlands and head-dresses. The wax candles, burned to stumps, addedstalactites of wax to the crystal drops of the chandeliers. Not a singlepiece of furniture was in its place. In the corners, three or fourarmchairs, drawn close together in a circle, had the appearance ofcontinuing a conversation. The whole effect was cheerful. A certain gracestill lingers round a dead feast. It has been a happy thing. On the chairsin disarray, among those fading flowers, beneath those extinct lights,people have thought of joy. The sun had succeeded to the chandelier, andmade its way gayly into the drawing-room.</p><p>Several minutes elapsed. Jean Valjean stood motionless on the spot whereBasque had left him. He was very pale. His eyes were hollow, and so sunkenin his head by sleeplessness that they nearly disappeared in their orbits.His black coat bore the weary folds of a garment that has been up allnight. The elbows were whitened with the down which the friction of clothagainst linen leaves behind it.</p><p>Jean Valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor at hisfeet by the sun.</p><p>There came a sound at the door, and he raised his eyes.</p><p>Marius entered, his head well up, his mouth smiling, an indescribablelight on his countenance, his brow expanded, his eyes triumphant. He hadnot slept either.</p><p>&ldquo;It is you, father!&rdquo; he exclaimed, on catching sight of Jean Valjean;&ldquo;that idiot of a Basque had such a mysterious air! But you have come tooearly. It is only half past twelve. Cosette is asleep.&rdquo;</p><p>That word: &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said to M. Fauchelevent by Marius, signified: supremefelicity. There had always existed, as the reader knows, a lofty wall, acoldness and a constraint between them; ice which must be broken ormelted. Marius had reached that point of intoxication when the wall waslowered, when the ice dissolved, and when M. Fauchelevent was to him, asto Cosette, a father.</p><p>He continued: his words poured forth, as is the peculiarity of divineparoxysms of joy.</p><p>&ldquo;How glad I am to see you! If you only knew how we missed you yesterday!Good morning, father. How is your hand? Better, is it not?&rdquo;</p><p>And, satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself, hepursued:</p><p>&ldquo;We have both been talking about you. Cosette loves you so dearly! Youmust not forget that you have a chamber here, We want nothing more to dowith the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé. We will have no more of it at all. How couldyou go to live in a street like that, which is sickly, which isdisagreeable, which is ugly, which has a barrier at one end, where one iscold, and into which one cannot enter? You are to come and installyourself here. And this very day. Or you will have to deal with Cosette.She means to lead us all by the nose, I warn you. You have your ownchamber here, it is close to ours, it opens on the garden; the troublewith the clock has been attended to, the bed is made, it is all ready, youhave only to take possession of it. Near your bed Cosette has placed ahuge, old, easy-chair covered with Utrecht velvet and she has said to it:‘Stretch out your arms to him.&rsquo; A nightingale comes to the clump ofacacias opposite your windows, every spring. In two months more you willhave it. You will have its nest on your left and ours on your right. Bynight it will sing, and by day Cosette will prattle. Your chamber facesdue South. Cosette will arrange your books for you, your Voyages ofCaptain Cook and the other,&mdash;Vancouver&rsquo;s and all your affairs. Ibelieve that there is a little valise to which you are attached, I havefixed upon a corner of honor for that. You have conquered my grandfather,you suit him. We will live together. Do you play whist? you will overwhelmmy grandfather with delight if you play whist. It is you who shall takeCosette to walk on the days when I am at the courts, you shall give heryour arm, you know, as you used to, in the Luxembourg. We are absolutelyresolved to be happy. And you shall be included in it, in our happiness,do you hear, father? Come, will you breakfast with us to-day?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, &ldquo;I have something to say to you. I am anex-convict.&rdquo;</p><p>The limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped, as well in thecase of the mind as in that of the ear. These words: &ldquo;I am an ex-convict,&rdquo; proceeding from the mouth of M. Fauchelevent and entering the ear ofMarius overshot the possible. It seemed to him that something had justbeen said to him; but he did not know what. He stood with his mouth wideopen.</p><p>Then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful.Wholly absorbed in his own dazzled state, he had not, up to that moment,observed the other man&rsquo;s terrible pallor.</p><p>Jean Valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm,unrolled the linen from around his hand, bared his thumb and showed it toMarius.</p><p>&ldquo;There is nothing the matter with my hand,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Marius looked at the thumb.</p><p>&ldquo;There has not been anything the matter with it,&rdquo; went on Jean Valjean.</p><p>There was, in fact, no trace of any injury.</p><p>Jean Valjean continued:</p><p>&ldquo;It was fitting that I should be absent from your marriage. I absentedmyself as much as was in my power. So I invented this injury in order thatI might not commit a forgery, that I might not introduce a flaw into themarriage documents, in order that I might escape from signing.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius stammered.</p><p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The meaning of it is,&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean, &ldquo;that I have been in thegalleys.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are driving me mad!&rdquo; exclaimed Marius in terror.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Pontmercy,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, &ldquo;I was nineteen years in thegalleys. For theft. Then, I was condemned for life for theft, for a secondoffence. At the present moment, I have broken my ban.&rdquo;</p><p>In vain did Marius recoil before the reality, refuse the fact, resist theevidence, he was forced to give way. He began to understand, and, asalways happens in such cases, he understood too much. An inward shudder ofhideous enlightenment flashed through him; an idea which made him quivertraversed his mind. He caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny for himselfin the future.</p><p>&ldquo;Say all, say all!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You are Cosette&rsquo;s father!&rdquo;</p><p>And he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribablehorror.</p><p>Jean Valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that heseemed to grow even to the ceiling.</p><p>&ldquo;It is necessary that you should believe me here, sir; although our oathto others may not be received in law . . .&rdquo;</p><p>Here he paused, then, with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority,he added, articulating slowly, and emphasizing the syllables:</p><p>&ldquo;. . . You will believe me. I the father of Cosette! before God, no.Monsieur le Baron Pontmercy, I am a peasant of Faverolles. I earned myliving by pruning trees. My name is not Fauchelevent, but Jean Valjean. Iam not related to Cosette. Reassure yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius stammered:</p><p>&ldquo;Who will prove that to me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I. Since I tell you so.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius looked at the man. He was melancholy yet tranquil. No lie couldproceed from such a calm. That which is icy is sincere. The truth could befelt in that chill of the tomb.</p><p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>Jean Valjean bent his head, as though taking note of this, and continued:</p><p>&ldquo;What am I to Cosette? A passer-by. Ten years ago, I did not know that shewas in existence. I love her, it is true. One loves a child whom one hasseen when very young, being old oneself. When one is old, one feelsoneself a grandfather towards all little children. You may, it seems tome, suppose that I have something which resembles a heart. She was anorphan. Without either father or mother. She needed me. That is why Ibegan to love her. Children are so weak that the first comer, even a manlike me, can become their protector. I have fulfilled this duty towardsCosette. I do not think that so slight a thing can be called a goodaction; but if it be a good action, well, say that I have done it.Register this attenuating circumstance. To-day, Cosette passes out of mylife; our two roads part. Henceforth, I can do nothing for her. She isMadame Pontmercy. Her providence has changed. And Cosette gains by thechange. All is well. As for the six hundred thousand francs, you do notmention them to me, but I forestall your thought, they are a deposit. Howdid that deposit come into my hands? What does that matter? I restore thedeposit. Nothing more can be demanded of me. I complete the restitution byannouncing my true name. That concerns me. I have a reason for desiringthat you should know who I am.&rdquo;</p><p>And Jean Valjean looked Marius full in the face.</p><p>All that Marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent. Certain gustsof destiny produce these billows in our souls.</p><p>We have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything within us isdispersed; we say the first things that occur to us, which are not alwaysprecisely those which should be said. There are sudden revelations whichone cannot bear, and which intoxicate like baleful wine. Marius wasstupefied by the novel situation which presented itself to him, to thepoint of addressing that man almost like a person who was angry with himfor this avowal.</p><p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;do you tell me all this? Who forces you to doso? You could have kept your secret to yourself. You are neitherdenounced, nor tracked nor pursued. You have a reason for wantonly makingsuch a revelation. Conclude. There is something more. In what connectiondo you make this confession? What is your motive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My motive?&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean in a voice so low and dull that onewould have said that he was talking to himself rather than to Marius.&ldquo;From what motive, in fact, has this convict just said &lsquo;I am a convict&rsquo;?Well, yes! the motive is strange. It is out of honesty. Stay, theunfortunate point is that I have a thread in my heart, which keeps mefast. It is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularlysolid. All life falls in ruin around one; one resists. Had I been able totear out that thread, to break it, to undo the knot or to cut it, to gofar away, I should have been safe. I had only to go away; there arediligences in the Rue Bouloy; you are happy; I am going. I have tried tobreak that thread, I have jerked at it, it would not break, I tore myheart with it. Then I said: &lsquo;I cannot live anywhere else than here.&rsquo; Imust stay. Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not simply remainhere? You offer me a chamber in this house, Madame Pontmercy is sincerelyattached to me, she said to the armchair: &lsquo;Stretch out your arms to him,&rsquo;your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me, I suit him, weshall live together, and take our meals in common, I shall give Cosette myarm . . . Madame Pontmercy, excuse me, it is a habit, we shall have butone roof, one table, one fire, the same chimney-corner in winter, the samepromenade in summer, that is joy, that is happiness, that is everything.We shall live as one family. One family!&rdquo;</p><p>At that word, Jean Valjean became wild. He folded his arms, glared at thefloor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss therein,and his voice suddenly rose in thundering tones:</p><p>&ldquo;As one family! No. I belong to no family. I do not belong to yours. I donot belong to any family of men. In houses where people are amongthemselves, I am superfluous. There are families, but there is nothing ofthe sort for me. I am an unlucky wretch; I am left outside. Did I have afather and mother? I almost doubt it. On the day when I gave that child inmarriage, all came to an end. I have seen her happy, and that she is witha man whom she loves, and that there exists here a kind old man, ahousehold of two angels, and all joys in that house, and that it was well,I said to myself: &lsquo;Enter thou not.&rsquo; I could have lied, it is true, havedeceived you all, and remained Monsieur Fauchelevent. So long as it wasfor her, I could lie; but now it would be for myself, and I must not. Itwas sufficient for me to hold my peace, it is true, and all would go on.You ask me what has forced me to speak? a very odd thing; my conscience.To hold my peace was very easy, however. I passed the night in trying topersuade myself to it; you questioned me, and what I have just said to youis so extraordinary that you have the right to do it; well, yes, I havepassed the night in alleging reasons to myself, and I gave myself verygood reasons, I have done what I could. But there are two things in whichI have not succeeded; in breaking the thread that holds me fixed, rivetedand sealed here by the heart, or in silencing some one who speaks softlyto me when I am alone. That is why I have come hither to tell youeverything this morning. Everything or nearly everything. It is useless totell you that which concerns only myself; I keep that to myself. You knowthe essential points. So I have taken my mystery and have brought it toyou. And I have disembowelled my secret before your eyes. It was not aresolution that was easy to take. I struggled all night long. Ah! youthink that I did not tell myself that this was no Champmathieu affair,that by concealing my name I was doing no one any injury, that the name ofFauchelevent had been given to me by Fauchelevent himself, out ofgratitude for a service rendered to him, and that I might assuredly keepit, and that I should be happy in that chamber which you offer me, that Ishould not be in any one&rsquo;s way, that I should be in my own little corner,and that, while you would have Cosette, I should have the idea that I wasin the same house with her. Each one of us would have had his share ofhappiness. If I continued to be Monsieur Fauchelevent, that would arrangeeverything. Yes, with the exception of my soul. There was joy everywhereupon my surface, but the bottom of my soul remained black. It is notenough to be happy, one must be content. Thus I should have remainedMonsieur Fauchelevent, thus I should have concealed my true visage, thus,in the presence of your expansion, I should have had an enigma, thus, inthe midst of your full noonday, I should have had shadows, thus, withoutcrying &lsquo;&rsquo;ware,&rsquo; I should have simply introduced the galleys to yourfireside, I should have taken my seat at your table with the thought thatif you knew who I was, you would drive me from it, I should have allowedmyself to be served by domestics who, had they known, would have said:‘How horrible!&rsquo; I should have touched you with my elbow, which you have aright to dislike, I should have filched your clasps of the hand! Therewould have existed in your house a division of respect between venerablewhite locks and tainted white locks; at your most intimate hours, when allhearts thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the rest, when wefour were together, your grandfather, you two and myself, a stranger wouldhave been present! I should have been side by side with you in yourexistence, having for my only care not to disarrange the cover of mydreadful pit. Thus, I, a dead man, should have thrust myself upon you whoare living beings. I should have condemned her to myself forever. You andCosette and I would have had all three of our heads in the green cap! Doesit not make you shudder? I am only the most crushed of men; I should havebeen the most monstrous of men. And I should have committed that crimeevery day! And I should have had that face of night upon my visage everyday! every day! And I should have communicated to you a share in my taintevery day! every day! to you, my dearly beloved, my children, to you, myinnocent creatures! Is it nothing to hold one&rsquo;s peace? is it a simplematter to keep silence? No, it is not simple. There is a silence whichlies. And my lie, and my fraud and my indignity, and my cowardice and mytreason and my crime, I should have drained drop by drop, I should havespit it out, then swallowed it again, I should have finished at midnightand have begun again at midday, and my &lsquo;good morning&rsquo; would have lied, andmy &lsquo;good night&rsquo; would have lied, and I should have slept on it, I shouldhave eaten it, with my bread, and I should have looked Cosette in theface, and I should have responded to the smile of the angel by the smileof the damned soul, and I should have been an abominable villain! Whyshould I do it? in order to be happy. In order to be happy. Have I theright to be happy? I stand outside of life, sir.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean paused. Marius listened. Such chains of ideas and ofanguishes cannot be interrupted. Jean Valjean lowered his voice once more,but it was no longer a dull voice&mdash;it was a sinister voice.</p><p>&ldquo;You ask why I speak? I am neither denounced, nor pursued, nor tracked,you say. Yes! I am denounced! yes! I am tracked! By whom? By myself. It isI who bar the passage to myself, and I drag myself, and I push myself, andI arrest myself, and I execute myself, and when one holds oneself, one isfirmly held.&rdquo;</p><p>And, seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the neck andextending it towards Marius:</p><p>&ldquo;Do you see that fist?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that it holds thatcollar in such a wise as not to release it? Well! conscience is anothergrasp! If one desires to be happy, sir, one must never understand duty;for, as soon as one has comprehended it, it is implacable. One would saythat it punished you for comprehending it; but no, it rewards you; for itplaces you in a hell, where you feel God beside you. One has no soonerlacerated his own entrails than he is at peace with himself.&rdquo;</p><p>And, with a poignant accent, he added:</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Pontmercy, this is not common sense, I am an honest man. It isby degrading myself in your eyes that I elevate myself in my own. This hashappened to me once before, but it was less painful then; it was a merenothing. Yes, an honest man. I should not be so if, through my fault, youhad continued to esteem me; now that you despise me, I am so. I have thatfatality hanging over me that, not being able to ever have anything butstolen consideration, that consideration humiliates me, and crushes meinwardly, and, in order that I may respect myself, it is necessary that Ishould be despised. Then I straighten up again. I am a galley-slave whoobeys his conscience. I know well that that is most improbable. But whatwould you have me do about it? it is the fact. I have entered intoengagements with myself; I keep them. There are encounters which bind us,there are chances which involve us in duties. You see, Monsieur Pontmercy,various things have happened to me in the course of my life.&rdquo;</p><p>Again Jean Valjean paused, swallowing his saliva with an effort, as thoughhis words had a bitter after-taste, and then he went on:</p><p>&ldquo;When one has such a horror hanging over one, one has not the right tomake others share it without their knowledge, one has not the right tomake them slip over one&rsquo;s own precipice without their perceiving it, onehas not the right to let one&rsquo;s red blouse drag upon them, one has no rightto slyly encumber with one&rsquo;s misery the happiness of others. It is hideousto approach those who are healthy, and to touch them in the dark withone&rsquo;s ulcer. In spite of the fact that Fauchelevent lent me his name, Ihave no right to use it; he could give it to me, but I could not take it.A name is an <i>I</i>. You see, sir, that I have thought somewhat, I haveread a little, although I am a peasant; and you see that I express myselfproperly. I understand things. I have procured myself an education. Well,yes, to abstract a name and to place oneself under it is dishonest.Letters of the alphabet can be filched, like a purse or a watch. To be afalse signature in flesh and blood, to be a living false key, to enter thehouse of honest people by picking their lock, never more to lookstraightforward, to forever eye askance, to be infamous within the <i>I</i>,no! no! no! no! no! It is better to suffer, to bleed, to weep, to tearone&rsquo;s skin from the flesh with one&rsquo;s nails, to pass nights writhing inanguish, to devour oneself body and soul. That is why I have just told youall this. Wantonly, as you say.&rdquo;</p><p>He drew a painful breath, and hurled this final word:</p><p>&ldquo;In days gone by, I stole a loaf of bread in order to live; to-day, inorder to live, I will not steal a name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To live!&rdquo; interrupted Marius. &ldquo;You do not need that name in order tolive?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! I understand the matter,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, raising and lowering hishead several times in succession.</p><p>A silence ensued. Both held their peace, each plunged in a gulf ofthoughts. Marius was sitting near a table and resting the corner of hismouth on one of his fingers, which was folded back. Jean Valjean waspacing to and fro. He paused before a mirror, and remained motionless.Then, as though replying to some inward course of reasoning, he said, ashe gazed at the mirror, which he did not see:</p><p>&ldquo;While, at present, I am relieved.&rdquo;</p><p>He took up his march again, and walked to the other end of thedrawing-room. At the moment when he turned round, he perceived that Mariuswas watching his walk. Then he said, with an inexpressible intonation:</p><p>&ldquo;I drag my leg a little. Now you understand why!&rdquo;</p><p>Then he turned fully round towards Marius:</p><p>&ldquo;And now, sir, imagine this: I have said nothing, I have remained MonsieurFauchelevent, I have taken my place in your house, I am one of you, I amin my chamber, I come to breakfast in the morning in slippers, in theevening all three of us go to the play, I accompany Madame Pontmercy tothe Tuileries, and to the Place Royale, we are together, you think me yourequal; one fine day you are there, and I am there, we are conversing, weare laughing; all at once, you hear a voice shouting this name: &lsquo;JeanValjean!&rsquo; and behold, that terrible hand, the police, darts from thedarkness, and abruptly tears off my mask!&rdquo;</p><p>Again he paused; Marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder. JeanValjean resumed:</p><p>&ldquo;What do you say to that?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius&rsquo; silence answered for him.</p><p>Jean Valjean continued:</p><p>&ldquo;You see that I am right in not holding my peace. Be happy, be in heaven,be the angel of an angel, exist in the sun, be content therewith, and donot trouble yourself about the means which a poor damned wretch takes toopen his breast and force his duty to come forth; you have before you,sir, a wretched man.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius slowly crossed the room, and, when he was quite close to JeanValjean, he offered the latter his hand.</p><p>But Marius was obliged to step up and take that hand which was notoffered, Jean Valjean let him have his own way, and it seemed to Mariusthat he pressed a hand of marble.</p><p>&ldquo;My grandfather has friends,&rdquo; said Marius; &ldquo;I will procure your pardon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is useless,&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean. &ldquo;I am believed to be dead, and thatsuffices. The dead are not subjected to surveillance. They are supposed torot in peace. Death is the same thing as pardon.&rdquo;</p><p>And, disengaging the hand which Marius held, he added, with a sort ofinexorable dignity:</p><p>&ldquo;Moreover, the friend to whom I have recourse is the doing of my duty; andI need but one pardon, that of my conscience.&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment, a door at the other end of the drawing-room opened gentlyhalf way, and in the opening Cosette&rsquo;s head appeared. They saw only hersweet face, her hair was in charming disorder, her eyelids were stillswollen with sleep. She made the movement of a bird, which thrusts itshead out of its nest, glanced first at her husband, then at Jean Valjean,and cried to them with a smile, so that they seemed to behold a smile atthe heart of a rose:</p><p>&ldquo;I will wager that you are talking politics. How stupid that is, insteadof being with me!&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean shuddered.</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette! . . .&rdquo; stammered Marius.</p><p>And he paused. One would have said that they were two criminals.</p><p>Cosette, who was radiant, continued to gaze at both of them. There wassomething in her eyes like gleams of paradise.</p><p>&ldquo;I have caught you in the very act,&rdquo; said Cosette. &ldquo;Just now, I heard myfather Fauchelevent through the door saying: &lsquo;Conscience . . . doing myduty . . .&rsquo; That is politics, indeed it is. I will not have it. Peopleshould not talk politics the very next day. It is not right.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are mistaken. Cosette,&rdquo; said Marius, &ldquo;we are talking business. We arediscussing the best investment of your six hundred thousand francs . . .&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is not it at all,&rdquo; interrupted Cosette. &ldquo;I am coming. Does anybodywant me here?&rdquo;</p><p>And, passing resolutely through the door, she entered the drawing-room.She was dressed in a voluminous white dressing-gown, with a thousand foldsand large sleeves which, starting from the neck, fell to her feet. In thegolden heavens of some ancient gothic pictures, there are these charmingsacks fit to clothe the angels.</p><p>She contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror, thenexclaimed, in an outburst of ineffable ecstasy:</p><p>&ldquo;There was once a King and a Queen. Oh! how happy I am!&rdquo;</p><p>That said, she made a curtsey to Marius and to Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am going to install myself near you in aneasy-chair, we breakfast in half an hour, you shall say anything you like,I know well that men must talk, and I will be very good.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius took her by the arm and said lovingly to her:</p><p>&ldquo;We are talking business.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Cosette, &ldquo;I have opened my window, a flock of pierrotshas arrived in the garden,&mdash;Birds, not maskers. To-day isAsh-Wednesday; but not for the birds.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I tell you that we are talking business, go, my little Cosette, leave usalone for a moment. We are talking figures. That will bore you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have a charming cravat on this morning, Marius. You are verydandified, monseigneur. No, it will not bore me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I assure you that it will bore you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. Since it is you. I shall not understand you, but I shall listen toyou. When one hears the voices of those whom one loves, one does not needto understand the words that they utter. That we should be here together&mdash;thatis all that I desire. I shall remain with you, bah!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are my beloved Cosette! Impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Cosette. &ldquo;I was going to tell you some news. I couldhave told you that your grandfather is still asleep, that your aunt is atmass, that the chimney in my father Fauchelevent&rsquo;s room smokes, thatNicolette has sent for the chimney-sweep, that Toussaint and Nicolettehave already quarrelled, that Nicolette makes sport of Toussaint&rsquo;sstammer. Well, you shall know nothing. Ah! it is impossible? you shallsee, gentlemen, that I, in my turn, can say: It is impossible. Then whowill be caught? I beseech you, my little Marius, let me stay here with youtwo.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I swear to you, that it is indispensable that we should be alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, am I anybody?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean had not uttered a single word. Cosette turned to him:</p><p>&ldquo;In the first place, father, I want you to come and embrace me. What doyou mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part? who gave mesuch a father as that? You must perceive that my family life is veryunhappy. My husband beats me. Come, embrace me instantly.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean approached.</p><p>Cosette turned toward Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;As for you, I shall make a face at you.&rdquo;</p><p>Then she presented her brow to Jean Valjean.</p><p>Jean Valjean advanced a step toward her.</p><p>Cosette recoiled.</p><p>&ldquo;Father, you are pale. Does your arm hurt you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;Did you sleep badly?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Are you sad?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Embrace me if you are well, if you sleep well, if you are content, I willnot scold you.&rdquo;</p><p>And again she offered him her brow.</p><p>Jean Valjean dropped a kiss upon that brow whereon rested a celestialgleam.</p><p>&ldquo;Smile.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean obeyed. It was the smile of a spectre.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, defend me against my husband.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette! . . .&rdquo; ejaculated Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Get angry, father. Say that I must stay. You can certainly talk beforeme. So you think me very silly. What you say is astonishing! business,placing money in a bank a great matter truly. Men make mysteries out ofnothing. I am very pretty this morning. Look at me, Marius.&rdquo;</p><p>And with an adorable shrug of the shoulders, and an indescribablyexquisite pout, she glanced at Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;I love you!&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;I adore you!&rdquo; said Cosette.</p><p>And they fell irresistibly into each other&rsquo;s arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Cosette, adjusting a fold of her dressing-gown, with atriumphant little grimace, &ldquo;I shall stay.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, not that,&rdquo; said Marius, in a supplicating tone. &ldquo;We have to finishsomething.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Still no?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius assumed a grave tone:</p><p>&ldquo;I assure you, Cosette, that it is impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! you put on your man&rsquo;s voice, sir. That is well, I go. You, father,have not upheld me. Monsieur my father, monsieur my husband, you aretyrants. I shall go and tell grandpapa. If you think that I am going toreturn and talk platitudes to you, you are mistaken. I am proud. I shallwait for you now. You shall see, that it is you who are going to be boredwithout me. I am going, it is well.&rdquo;</p><p>And she left the room.</p><p>Two seconds later, the door opened once more, her fresh and rosy head wasagain thrust between the two leaves, and she cried to them:</p><p>&ldquo;I am very angry indeed.&rdquo;</p><p>The door closed again, and the shadows descended once more.</p><p>It was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed thenight, without itself being conscious of it.</p><p>Marius made sure that the door was securely closed.</p><p>&ldquo;Poor Cosette!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;when she finds out . . .&rdquo;</p><p>At that word Jean Valjean trembled in every limb. He fixed on Marius abewildered eye.</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette! oh yes, it is true, you are going to tell Cosette about this.That is right. Stay, I had not thought of that. One has the strength forone thing, but not for another. Sir, I conjure you, I entreat now, sir,give me your most sacred word of honor, that you will not tell her. Is itnot enough that you should know it? I have been able to say it myselfwithout being forced to it, I could have told it to the universe, to thewhole world,&mdash;it was all one to me. But she, she does not know whatit is, it would terrify her. What, a convict! we should be obliged toexplain matters to her, to say to her: &lsquo;He is a man who has been in thegalleys.&rsquo; She saw the chain-gang pass by one day. Oh! My God!&rdquo; . . . Hedropped into an armchair and hid his face in his hands.</p><p>His grief was not audible, but from the quivering of his shoulders it wasevident that he was weeping. Silent tears, terrible tears.</p><p>There is something of suffocation in the sob. He was seized with a sort ofconvulsion, he threw himself against the back of the chair as though togain breath, letting his arms fall, and allowing Marius to see his faceinundated with tears, and Marius heard him murmur, so low that his voiceseemed to issue from fathomless depths:</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! would that I could die!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Be at your ease,&rdquo; said Marius, &ldquo;I will keep your secret for myselfalone.&rdquo;</p><p>And, less touched, perhaps, than he ought to have been, butforced, for the last hour, to familiarize himself with something asunexpected as it was dreadful, gradually beholding the convict superposedbefore his very eyes, upon M. Fauchelevent, overcome, little by little, bythat lugubrious reality, and led, by the natural inclination of thesituation, to recognize the space which had just been placed between thatman and himself, Marius added:</p><p>&ldquo;It is impossible that I should not speak a word to you with regard to thedeposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted. That is an actof probity. It is just that some recompense should be bestowed on you. Fixthe sum yourself, it shall be counted out to you. Do not fear to set itvery high.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thank you, sir,&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean, gently.</p><p>He remained in thought for a moment, mechanically passing the tip of hisfore-finger across his thumb-nail, then he lifted up his voice:</p><p>&ldquo;All is nearly over. But one last thing remains for me . . .&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation, and, withoutvoice, without breath, he stammered rather than said:</p><p>&ldquo;Now that you know, do you think, sir, you, who are the master, that Iought not to see Cosette any more?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think that would be better,&rdquo; replied Marius coldly.</p><p>&ldquo;I shall never see her more,&rdquo; murmured Jean Valjean. And he directed hissteps towards the door.</p><p>He laid his hand on the knob, the latch yielded, the door opened. JeanValjean pushed it open far enough to pass through, stood motionless for asecond, then closed the door again and turned to Marius.</p><p>He was no longer pale, he was livid. There were no longer any tears in hiseyes, but only a sort of tragic flame. His voice had regained a strangecomposure.</p><p>&ldquo;Stay, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you will allow it, I will come to see her. Iassure you that I desire it greatly. If I had not cared to see Cosette, Ishould not have made to you the confession that I have made, I should havegone away; but, as I desired to remain in the place where Cosette is, andto continue to see her, I had to tell you about it honestly. You follow myreasoning, do you not? it is a matter easily understood. You see, I havehad her with me for more than nine years. We lived first in that hut onthe boulevard, then in the convent, then near the Luxembourg. That waswhere you saw her for the first time. You remember her blue plush hat.Then we went to the Quartier des Invalides, where there was a railing on agarden, the Rue Plumet. I lived in a little back court-yard, whence Icould hear her piano. That was my life. We never left each other. Thatlasted for nine years and some months. I was like her own father, and shewas my child. I do not know whether you understand, Monsieur Pontmercy,but to go away now, never to see her again, never to speak to her again,to no longer have anything, would be hard. If you do not disapprove of it,I will come to see Cosette from time to time. I will not come often. Iwill not remain long. You shall give orders that I am to be received inthe little waiting-room. On the ground floor. I could enter perfectly wellby the back door, but that might create surprise perhaps, and it would bebetter, I think, for me to enter by the usual door. Truly, sir, I shouldlike to see a little more of Cosette. As rarely as you please. Putyourself in my place, I have nothing left but that. And then, we must becautious. If I no longer come at all, it would produce a bad effect, itwould be considered singular. What I can do, by the way, is to come in theafternoon, when night is beginning to fall.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You shall come every evening,&rdquo; said Marius, &ldquo;and Cosette will be waitingfor you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are kind, sir,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>Marius saluted Jean Valjean, happiness escorted despair to the door, andthese two men parted.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0355" id="link2HCH0355"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE OBSCURITIES WHICH A REVELATION CAN CONTAIN</h3><p>Marius was quite upset.</p><p>The sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man besidewhom he had seen Cosette, was now explained to him. There was somethingenigmatic about that person, of which his instinct had warned him.</p><p>This enigma was the most hideous of disgraces, the galleys. This M.Fauchelevent was the convict Jean Valjean.</p><p>To abruptly find such a secret in the midst of one&rsquo;s happiness resemblesthe discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves.</p><p>Was the happiness of Marius and Cosette thenceforth condemned to such aneighborhood? Was this an accomplished fact? Did the acceptance of thatman form a part of the marriage now consummated? Was there nothing to bedone?</p><p>Had Marius wedded the convict as well?</p><p>In vain may one be crowned with light and joy, in vain may one taste thegrand purple hour of life, happy love, such shocks would force even thearchangel in his ecstasy, even the demigod in his glory, to shudder.</p><p>As is always the case in changes of view of this nature, Marius askedhimself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself. Had he beenwanting in divination? Had he been wanting in prudence? Had heinvoluntarily dulled his wits? A little, perhaps. Had he entered upon thislove affair, which had ended in his marriage to Cosette, without takingsufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings? He admitted,&mdash;itis thus, by a series of successive admissions of ourselves in regard toourselves, that life amends us, little by little,&mdash;he admitted thechimerical and visionary side of his nature, a sort of internal cloudpeculiar to many organizations, and which, in paroxysms of passion andsorrow, dilates as the temperature of the soul changes, and invades theentire man, to such a degree as to render him nothing more than aconscience bathed in a mist. We have more than once indicated thischaracteristic element of Marius&rsquo; individuality.</p><p>He recalled that, in the intoxication of his love, in the Rue Plumet,during those six or seven ecstatic weeks, he had not even spoken to Cosetteof that drama in the Gorbeau hovel, where the victim had taken up such asingular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuing flight. Howhad it happened that he had not mentioned this to Cosette? Yet it was sonear and so terrible! How had it come to pass that he had not even namedthe Thénardiers, and, particularly, on the day when he had encounteredÉponine? He now found it almost difficult to explain his silence of thattime. Nevertheless, he could account for it. He recalled his benumbedstate, his intoxication with Cosette, love absorbing everything, thatcatching away of each other into the ideal, and perhaps also, like theimperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this violent and charmingstate of the soul, a vague, dull instinct impelling him to conceal andabolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure, contact with which hedreaded, in which he did not wish to play any part, his agency in which hehad kept secret, and in which he could be neither narrator nor witnesswithout being an accuser.</p><p>Moreover, these few weeks had been a flash of lightning; there had been notime for anything except love.</p><p>In short, having weighed everything, turned everything over in his mind,examined everything, whatever might have been the consequences if he hadtold Cosette about the Gorbeau ambush, even if he had discovered that JeanValjean was a convict, would that have changed him, Marius? Would thathave changed her, Cosette? Would he have drawn back? Would he have adoredher any the less? Would he have refrained from marrying her? No. Thenthere was nothing to regret, nothing with which he need reproach himself.All was well. There is a deity for those drunken men who are calledlovers. Marius blind, had followed the path which he would have chosen hadhe been in full possession of his sight. Love had bandaged his eyes, inorder to lead him whither? To paradise.</p><p>But this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernalaccompaniment.</p><p>Marius&rsquo; ancient estrangement towards this man, towards this Faucheleventwho had turned into Jean Valjean, was at present mingled with horror.</p><p>In this horror, let us state, there was some pity, and even a certainsurprise.</p><p>This thief, this thief guilty of a second offence, had restored thatdeposit. And what a deposit! Six hundred thousand francs.</p><p>He alone was in the secret of that deposit. He might have kept it all, hehad restored it all.</p><p>Moreover, he had himself revealed his situation. Nothing forced him tothis. If any one learned who he was, it was through himself. In thisavowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation, there wasacceptance of peril. For a condemned man, a mask is not a mask, it is ashelter. A false name is security, and he had rejected that false name.He, the galley-slave, might have hidden himself forever in an honestfamily; he had withstood this temptation. And with what motive? Through aconscientious scruple. He himself explained this with the irresistibleaccents of truth. In short, whatever this Jean Valjean might be, he was,undoubtedly, a conscience which was awakening. There existed somemysterious re-habilitation which had begun; and, to all appearances,scruples had for a long time already controlled this man. Such fits ofjustice and goodness are not characteristic of vulgar natures. Anawakening of conscience is grandeur of soul.</p><p>Jean Valjean was sincere. This sincerity, visible, palpable, irrefragable,evident from the very grief that it caused him, rendered inquiriesuseless, and conferred authority on all that that man had said.</p><p>Here, for Marius, there was a strange reversal of situations. Whatbreathed from M. Fauchelevent? distrust. What did Jean Valjean inspire?confidence.</p><p>In the mysterious balance of this Jean Valjean which the pensive Mariusstruck, he admitted the active principle, he admitted the passiveprinciple, and he tried to reach a balance.</p><p>But all this went on as in a storm. Marius, while endeavoring to form aclear idea of this man, and while pursuing Jean Valjean, so to speak, inthe depths of his thought, lost him and found him again in a fatal mist.</p><p>The deposit honestly restored, the probity of the confession&mdash;thesewere good. This produced a lightening of the cloud, then the cloud becameblack once more.</p><p>Troubled as were Marius&rsquo; memories, a shadow of them returned to him.</p><p>After all, what was that adventure in the Jondrette attic? Why had thatman taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering acomplaint?</p><p>Here Marius found the answer. Because that man was a fugitive fromjustice, who had broken his ban.</p><p>Another question: Why had that man come to the barricade?</p><p>For Marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection which hadreappeared in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application ofheat. This man had been in the barricade. He had not fought there. Whathad he come there for? In the presence of this question a spectre sprangup and replied: &ldquo;Javert.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of Jean Valjean draggingthe pinioned Javert out of the barricade, and he still heard behind thecorner of the little Rue Mondétour that frightful pistol shot. Obviously,there was hatred between that police spy and the galley-slave. The one wasin the other&rsquo;s way. Jean Valjean had gone to the barricade for the purposeof revenging himself. He had arrived late. He probably knew that Javertwas a prisoner there. The Corsican vendetta has penetrated to certainlower strata and has become the law there; it is so simple that it doesnot astonish souls which are but half turned towards good; and thosehearts are so constituted that a criminal, who is in the path ofrepentance, may be scrupulous in the matter of theft and unscrupulous inthe matter of vengeance. Jean Valjean had killed Javert. At least, thatseemed to be evident.</p><p>This was the final question, to be sure; but to this there was no reply.This question Marius felt like pincers. How had it come to pass that JeanValjean&rsquo;s existence had elbowed that of Cosette for so long a period?</p><p>What melancholy sport of Providence was that which had placed that childin contact with that man? Are there then chains for two which are forgedon high? and does God take pleasure in coupling the angel with the demon?So a crime and an innocence can be room-mates in the mysterious galleys ofwretchedness? In that defiling of condemned persons which is called humandestiny, can two brows pass side by side, the one ingenuous, the otherformidable, the one all bathed in the divine whiteness of dawn, the otherforever blemished by the flash of an eternal lightning? Who could havearranged that inexplicable pairing off? In what manner, in consequence ofwhat prodigy, had any community of life been established between thiscelestial little creature and that old criminal?</p><p>Who could have bound the lamb to the wolf, and, what was still moreincomprehensible, have attached the wolf to the lamb? For the wolf lovedthe lamb, for the fierce creature adored the feeble one, for, during thespace of nine years, the angel had had the monster as her point ofsupport. Cosette&rsquo;s childhood and girlhood, her advent in the daylight, hervirginal growth towards life and light, had been sheltered by that hideousdevotion. Here questions exfoliated, so to speak, into innumerableenigmas, abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses, and Marius could nolonger bend over Jean Valjean without becoming dizzy. What was thisman-precipice?</p><p>The old symbols of Genesis are eternal; in human society, such as it nowexists, and until a broader day shall effect a change in it, there willalways be two men, the one superior, the other subterranean; the one whichis according to good is Abel; the other which is according to evil isCain. What was this tender Cain? What was this ruffian religiouslyabsorbed in the adoration of a virgin, watching over her, rearing her,guarding her, dignifying her, and enveloping her, impure as he washimself, with purity?</p><p>What was that cesspool which had venerated that innocence to such a pointas not to leave upon it a single spot? What was this Jean Valjeaneducating Cosette? What was this figure of the shadows which had for itsonly object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadow andfrom every cloud?</p><p>That was Jean Valjean&rsquo;s secret; that was also God&rsquo;s secret.</p><p>In the presence of this double secret, Marius recoiled. The one, in somesort, reassured him as to the other. God was as visible in this affair aswas Jean Valjean. God has his instruments. He makes use of the tool whichhe wills. He is not responsible to men. Do we know how God sets about thework? Jean Valjean had labored over Cosette. He had, to some extent, madethat soul. That was incontestable. Well, what then? The workman washorrible; but the work was admirable. God produces his miracles as seemsgood to him. He had constructed that charming Cosette, and he had employedJean Valjean. It had pleased him to choose this strange collaborator forhimself. What account have we to demand of him? Is this the first timethat the dung-heap has aided the spring to create the rose?</p><p>Marius made himself these replies, and declared to himself that they weregood. He had not dared to press Jean Valjean on all the points which wehave just indicated, but he did not confess to himself that he did notdare to do it. He adored Cosette, he possessed Cosette, Cosette wassplendidly pure. That was sufficient for him. What enlightenment did heneed? Cosette was a light. Does light require enlightenment? He hadeverything; what more could he desire? All,&mdash;is not that enough? JeanValjean&rsquo;s personal affairs did not concern him.</p><p>And bending over the fatal shadow of that man, he clung fast,convulsively, to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch: &ldquo;I amnothing to Cosette. Ten years ago I did not know that she was inexistence.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean was a passer-by. He had said so himself. Well, he had passed.Whatever he was, his part was finished.</p><p>Henceforth, there remained Marius to fulfil the part of Providence toCosette. Cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself, in herlover, her husband, her celestial male. Cosette, as she took her flight,winged and transfigured, left behind her on the earth her hideous andempty chrysalis, Jean Valjean.</p><p>In whatever circle of ideas Marius revolved, he always returned to acertain horror for Jean Valjean. A sacred horror, perhaps, for, as we havejust pointed out, he felt a <i>quid divinum</i> in that man. But do what hewould, and seek what extenuation he would, he was certainly forced to fallback upon this: the man was a convict; that is to say, a being who has noteven a place in the social ladder, since he is lower than the very lowestrung. After the very last of men comes the convict. The convict is nolonger, so to speak, in the semblance of the living. The law has deprivedhim of the entire quantity of humanity of which it can deprive a man.</p><p>Marius, on penal questions, still held to the inexorable system, though hewas a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on the subjectof those whom the law strikes. He had not yet accomplished all progress,we admit. He had not yet come to distinguish between that which is writtenby man and that which is written by God, between law and right. He had notexamined and weighed the right which man takes to dispose of theirrevocable and the irreparable. He was not shocked by the word <i>vindicte</i>.He found it quite simple that certain breaches of the written law shouldbe followed by eternal suffering, and he accepted, as the process ofcivilization, social damnation. He still stood at this point, though safeto advance infallibly later on, since his nature was good, and, at bottom,wholly formed of latent progress.</p><p>In this stage of his ideas, Jean Valjean appeared to him hideous andrepulsive. He was a man reproved, he was the convict. That word was forhim like the sound of the trump on the Day of Judgment; and, after havingreflected upon Jean Valjean for a long time, his final gesture had been toturn away his head. <i>Vade retro</i>.</p><p>Marius, if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact, whileinterrogating Jean Valjean to such a point that Jean Valjean had said:&ldquo;You are confessing me,&rdquo; had not, nevertheless, put to him two or threedecisive questions.</p><p>It was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind, but that hehad been afraid of them. The Jondrette attic? The barricade? Javert? Whoknows where these revelations would have stopped? Jean Valjean did notseem like a man who would draw back, and who knows whether Marius, afterhaving urged him on, would not have himself desired to hold him back?</p><p>Has it not happened to all of us, in certain supreme conjunctures, to stopour ears in order that we may not hear the reply, after we have asked aquestion? It is especially when one loves that one gives way to theseexhibitions of cowardice. It is not wise to question sinister situationsto the last point, particularly when the indissoluble side of our life isfatally intermingled with them. What a terrible light might have proceededfrom the despairing explanations of Jean Valjean, and who knows whetherthat hideous glare would not have darted forth as far as Cosette? Whoknows whether a sort of infernal glow would not have lingered behind it onthe brow of that angel? The spattering of a lightning-flash is of thethunder also. Fatality has points of juncture where innocence itself isstamped with crime by the gloomy law of the reflections which give color.The purest figures may forever preserve the reflection of a horribleassociation. Rightly or wrongly, Marius had been afraid. He already knewtoo much. He sought to dull his senses rather than to gain further light.</p><p>In dismay he bore off Cosette in his arms and shut his eyes to JeanValjean.</p><p>That man was the night, the living and horrible night. How should he dareto seek the bottom of it? It is a terrible thing to interrogate theshadow. Who knows what its reply will be? The dawn may be blackenedforever by it.</p><p>In this state of mind the thought that that man would, henceforth, comeinto any contact whatever with Cosette was a heartrending perplexity toMarius.</p><p>He now almost reproached himself for not having put those formidablequestions, before which he had recoiled, and from which an implacable anddefinitive decision might have sprung. He felt that he was too good, toogentle, too weak, if we must say the word. This weakness had led him to animprudent concession. He had allowed himself to be touched. He had been inthe wrong. He ought to have simply and purely rejected Jean Valjean. JeanValjean played the part of fire, and that is what he should have done, andhave freed his house from that man.</p><p>He was vexed with himself, he was angry with that whirlwind of emotionswhich had deafened, blinded, and carried him away. He was displeased withhimself.</p><p>What was he to do now? Jean Valjean&rsquo;s visits were profoundly repugnant tohim. What was the use in having that man in his house? What did the manwant? Here, he became dismayed, he did not wish to dig down, he did notwish to penetrate deeply; he did not wish to sound himself. He hadpromised, he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise; Jean Valjeanheld his promise; one must keep one&rsquo;s word even to a convict, above all toa convict. Still, his first duty was to Cosette. In short, he was carriedaway by the repugnance which dominated him.</p><p>Marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind, passing fromone to the other, and moved by all of them. Hence arose a profoundtrouble.</p><p>It was not easy for him to hide this trouble from Cosette, but love is atalent, and Marius succeeded in doing it.</p><p>However, without any apparent object, he questioned Cosette, who was ascandid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing; he talked of herchildhood and her youth, and he became more and more convinced that thatconvict had been everything good, paternal and respectable that a man canbe towards Cosette. All that Marius had caught a glimpse of and hadsurmised was real. That sinister nettle had loved and protected that lily.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0411" id="link2H_4_0411"></a>BOOK EIGHTH&mdash;FADING AWAY OF THE TWILIGHT</h3><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0040" id="linkimage-0040"></a><img src="images/5b8-1-twilight-decline.jpg" alt="The Twilight Decline" width="100%" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0356" id="link2HCH0356"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE LOWER CHAMBER</h3><p>On the following day, at nightfall, Jean Valjean knocked at the carriagegate of the Gillenormand house. It was Basque who received him. Basque wasin the courtyard at the appointed hour, as though he had received hisorders. It sometimes happens that one says to a servant: &ldquo;You will watchfor Mr. So and So, when he arrives.&rdquo;</p><p>Basque addressed Jean Valjean without waiting for the latter to approachhim:</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires togo upstairs or to remain below?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will remain below,&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean.</p><p>Basque, who was perfectly respectful, opened the door of the waiting-roomand said:</p><p>&ldquo;I will go and inform Madame.&rdquo;</p><p>The room which Jean Valjean entered was a damp, vaulted room on the groundfloor, which served as a cellar on occasion, which opened on the street,was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated window.</p><p>This chamber was not one of those which are harassed by thefeather-duster, the pope&rsquo;s head brush, and the broom. The dust restedtranquilly there. Persecution of the spiders was not organized there. Afine web, which spread far and wide, and was very black and ornamentedwith dead flies, formed a wheel on one of the window-panes. The room,which was small and low-ceiled, was furnished with a heap of empty bottlespiled up in one corner.</p><p>The wall, which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash, was scaling off inlarge flakes. At one end there was a chimney-piece painted in black with anarrow shelf. A fire was burning there; which indicated that JeanValjean&rsquo;s reply: &ldquo;I will remain below,&rdquo; had been foreseen.</p><p>Two armchairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace. Betweenthe chairs an old bedside rug, which displayed more foundation thread thanwool, had been spread by way of a carpet.</p><p>The chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight fallingthrough the window.</p><p>Jean Valjean was fatigued. For days he had neither eaten nor slept. Hethrew himself into one of the armchairs.</p><p>Basque returned, set a lighted candle on the chimney-piece and retired.Jean Valjean, his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast,perceived neither Basque nor the candle.</p><p>All at once, he drew himself up with a start. Cosette was standing besidehim.</p><p>He had not seen her enter, but he had felt that she was there.</p><p>He turned round. He gazed at her. She was adorably lovely. But what he wascontemplating with that profound gaze was not her beauty but her soul.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed Cosette, &ldquo;father, I knew that you were peculiar, but Inever should have expected this. What an idea! Marius told me that youwish me to receive you here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it is my wish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I expected that reply. Good. I warn you that I am going to make a scenefor you. Let us begin at the beginning. Embrace me, father.&rdquo;</p><p>And she offered him her cheek.</p><p>Jean Valjean remained motionless.</p><p>&ldquo;You do not stir. I take note of it. Attitude of guilt. But never mind, Ipardon you. Jesus Christ said: Offer the other cheek. Here it is.&rdquo;</p><p>And she presented her other cheek.</p><p>Jean Valjean did not move. It seemed as though his feet were nailed to thepavement.</p><p>&ldquo;This is becoming serious,&rdquo; said Cosette. &ldquo;What have I done to you? Ideclare that I am perplexed. You owe me reparation. You will dine withus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have dined.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is not true. I will get M. Gillenormand to scold you. Grandfathersare made to reprimand fathers. Come. Go upstairs with me to thedrawing-room. Immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;</p><p>Here Cosette lost ground a little. She ceased to command and passed toquestioning.</p><p>&ldquo;But why? and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to seeme. It&rsquo;s horrible here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thou knowest . . .&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean caught himself up.</p><p>&ldquo;You know, madame, that I am peculiar, I have my freaks.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette struck her tiny hands together.</p><p>&ldquo;Madame! . . . You know! . . . more novelties! What is the meaning ofthis?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which heoccasionally had recourse:</p><p>&ldquo;You wished to be Madame. You are so.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not for you, father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do not call me father.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Call me &lsquo;Monsieur Jean.&rsquo; &lsquo;Jean,&rsquo; if you like.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are no longer my father? I am no longer Cosette? &lsquo;Monsieur Jean&rsquo;?What does this mean? why, these are revolutions, aren&rsquo;t they? what hastaken place? come, look me in the face. And you won&rsquo;t live with us! Andyou won&rsquo;t have my chamber! What have I done to you? Has anythinghappened?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything is as usual.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you change your name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have changed yours, surely.&rdquo;</p><p>He smiled again with the same smile as before and added:</p><p>&ldquo;Since you are Madame Pontmercy, I certainly can be Monsieur Jean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand anything about it. All this is idiotic. I shall askpermission of my husband for you to be &lsquo;Monsieur Jean.&rsquo; I hope that hewill not consent to it. You cause me a great deal of pain. One does havefreaks, but one does not cause one&rsquo;s little Cosette grief. That is wrong.You have no right to be wicked, you who are so good.&rdquo;</p><p>He made no reply.</p><p>She seized his hands with vivacity, and raising them to her face with anirresistible movement, she pressed them against her neck beneath her chin,which is a gesture of profound tenderness.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;be good!&rdquo;</p><p>And she went on:</p><p>&ldquo;This is what I call being good: being nice and coming and living here,&mdash;thereare birds here as there are in the Rue Plumet,&mdash;living with us,quitting that hole of a Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé, not giving us riddles toguess, being like all the rest of the world, dining with us, breakfastingwith us, being my father.&rdquo;</p><p>He loosed her hands.</p><p>&ldquo;You no longer need a father, you have a husband.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette became angry.</p><p>&ldquo;I no longer need a father! One really does not know what to say to thingslike that, which are not common sense!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If Toussaint were here,&rdquo; resumed Jean Valjean, like a person who isdriven to seek authorities, and who clutches at every branch, &ldquo;she wouldbe the first to agree that it is true that I have always had ways of myown. There is nothing new in this. I always have loved my black corner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it is cold here. One cannot see distinctly. It is abominable, that itis, to wish to be Monsieur Jean! I will not have you say &lsquo;you&rsquo; to me.</p><p>&ldquo;Just now, as I was coming hither,&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean, &ldquo;I saw a pieceof furniture in the Rue Saint Louis. It was at a cabinet-maker&rsquo;s. If Iwere a pretty woman, I would treat myself to that bit of furniture. A veryneat toilet table in the reigning style. What you call rosewood, I think.It is inlaid. The mirror is quite large. There are drawers. It is pretty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hou! the villainous bear!&rdquo; replied Cosette.</p><p>And with supreme grace, setting her teeth and drawing back her lips, sheblew at Jean Valjean. She was a Grace copying a cat.</p><p>&ldquo;I am furious,&rdquo; she resumed. &ldquo;Ever since yesterday, you have made me rage,all of you. I am greatly vexed. I don&rsquo;t understand. You do not defend meagainst Marius. Marius will not uphold me against you. I am all alone. Iarrange a chamber prettily. If I could have put the good God there I wouldhave done it. My chamber is left on my hands. My lodger sends me intobankruptcy. I order a nice little dinner of Nicolette. We will havenothing to do with your dinner, Madame. And my father Fauchelevent wantsme to call him &lsquo;Monsieur Jean,&rsquo; and to receive him in a frightful, old,ugly cellar, where the walls have beards, and where the crystal consistsof empty bottles, and the curtains are of spiders&rsquo; webs! You are singular,I admit, that is your style, but people who get married are granted atruce. You ought not to have begun being singular again instantly. So youare going to be perfectly contented in your abominable Rue de l&rsquo;HommeArmé. I was very desperate indeed there, that I was. What have you againstme? You cause me a great deal of grief. Fi!&rdquo;</p><p>And, becoming suddenly serious, she gazed intently at Jean Valjean andadded:</p><p>&ldquo;Are you angry with me because I am happy?&rdquo;</p><p>Ingenuousness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep. This question,which was simple for Cosette, was profound for Jean Valjean. Cosette hadmeant to scratch, and she lacerated.</p><p>Jean Valjean turned pale.</p><p>He remained for a moment without replying, then, with an inexpressibleintonation, and speaking to himself, he murmured:</p><p>&ldquo;Her happiness was the object of my life. Now God may sign my dismissal.Cosette, thou art happy; my day is over.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, you have said <i>thou</i> to me!&rdquo; exclaimed Cosette.</p><p>And she sprang to his neck.</p><p>Jean Valjean, in bewilderment, strained her wildly to his breast. Italmost seemed to him as though he were taking her back.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks, father!&rdquo; said Cosette.</p><p>This enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for JeanValjean. He gently removed Cosette&rsquo;s arms, and took his hat.</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Cosette.</p><p>&ldquo;I leave you, Madame, they are waiting for you.&rdquo;</p><p>And, from the threshold, he added:</p><p>&ldquo;I have said <i>thou</i> to you. Tell your husband that this shall not happenagain. Pardon me.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean quitted the room, leaving Cosette stupefied at thisenigmatical farewell.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0357" id="link2HCH0357"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;ANOTHER STEP BACKWARDS</h3><p>On the following day, at the same hour, Jean Valjean came.</p><p>Cosette asked him no questions, was no longer astonished, no longerexclaimed that she was cold, no longer spoke of the drawing-room, sheavoided saying either &ldquo;father&rdquo; or &ldquo;Monsieur Jean.&rdquo; She allowed herself tobe addressed as <i>you</i>. She allowed herself to be called Madame. Only, herjoy had undergone a certain diminution. She would have been sad, ifsadness had been possible to her.</p><p>It is probable that she had had with Marius one of those conversations inwhich the beloved man says what he pleases, explains nothing, andsatisfies the beloved woman. The curiosity of lovers does not extend veryfar beyond their own love.</p><p>The lower room had made a little toilet. Basque had suppressed thebottles, and Nicolette the spiders.</p><p>All the days which followed brought Jean Valjean at the same hour. He cameevery day, because he had not the strength to take Marius&rsquo; words otherwisethan literally. Marius arranged matters so as to be absent at the hourswhen Jean Valjean came. The house grew accustomed to the novel ways of M.Fauchelevent. Toussaint helped in this direction: &ldquo;Monsieur has alwaysbeen like that,&rdquo; she repeated. The grandfather issued this decree:&mdash;&ldquo;He&rsquo;san original.&rdquo; And all was said. Moreover, at the age of ninety-six, nobond is any longer possible, all is merely juxtaposition; a newcomer is inthe way. There is no longer any room; all habits are acquired. M.Fauchelevent, M. Tranchelevent, Father Gillenormand asked nothing betterthan to be relieved from &ldquo;that gentleman.&rdquo; He added:&mdash;&ldquo;Nothing ismore common than those originals. They do all sorts of queer things. Theyhave no reason. The Marquis de Canaples was still worse. He bought apalace that he might lodge in the garret. These are fantastic appearancesthat people affect.&rdquo;</p><p>No one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation. And moreover, whocould have guessed such a thing? There are marshes of this description inIndia. The water seems extraordinary, inexplicable, rippling though thereis no wind, and agitated where it should be calm. One gazes at the surfaceof these causeless ebullitions; one does not perceive the hydra whichcrawls on the bottom.</p><p>Many men have a secret monster in this same manner, a dragon which gnawsthem, a despair which inhabits their night. Such a man resembles othermen, he goes and comes. No one knows that he bears within him a frightfulparasitic pain with a thousand teeth, which lives within the unhappy man,and of which he is dying. No one knows that this man is a gulf. He isstagnant but deep. From time to time, a trouble of which the onlookerunderstands nothing appears on his surface. A mysterious wrinkle isformed, then vanishes, then reappears; an air-bubble rises and bursts. Itis the breathing of the unknown beast.</p><p>Certain strange habits: arriving at the hour when other people are takingtheir leave, keeping in the background when other people are displayingthemselves, preserving on all occasions what may be designated as thewall-colored mantle, seeking the solitary walk, preferring the desertedstreet, avoiding any share in conversation, avoiding crowds and festivals,seeming at one&rsquo;s ease and living poorly, having one&rsquo;s key in one&rsquo;s pocket,and one&rsquo;s candle at the porter&rsquo;s lodge, however rich one may be, enteringby the side door, ascending the private staircase,&mdash;all theseinsignificant singularities, fugitive folds on the surface, often proceedfrom a formidable foundation.</p><p>Many weeks passed in this manner. A new life gradually took possession ofCosette: the relations which marriage creates, visits, the care of thehouse, pleasures, great matters. Cosette&rsquo;s pleasures were not costly, theyconsisted in one thing: being with Marius. The great occupation of herlife was to go out with him, to remain with him. It was for them a joythat was always fresh, to go out arm in arm, in the face of the sun, inthe open street, without hiding themselves, before the whole world, bothof them completely alone.</p><p>Cosette had one vexation. Toussaint could not get on with Nicolette, thesoldering of two elderly maids being impossible, and she went away. Thegrandfather was well; Marius argued a case here and there; AuntGillenormand peacefully led that life aside which sufficed for her, besidethe new household. Jean Valjean came every day.</p><p>The address as <i>thou</i> disappeared, the <i>you</i>, the &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; the &ldquo;MonsieurJean,&rdquo; rendered him another person to Cosette. The care which he hadhimself taken to detach her from him was succeeding. She became more andmore gay and less and less tender. Yet she still loved him sincerely, andhe felt it.</p><p>One day she said to him suddenly: &ldquo;You used to be my father, you are nolonger my father, you were my uncle, you are no longer my uncle, you wereMonsieur Fauchelevent, you are Jean. Who are you then? I don&rsquo;t like allthis. If I did not know how good you are, I should be afraid of you.&rdquo;</p><p>He still lived in the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé, because he could not make uphis mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where Cosette dwelt.</p><p>At first, he only remained a few minutes with Cosette, and then went away.</p><p>Little by little he acquired the habit of making his visits less brief.One would have said that he was taking advantage of the authorization ofthe days which were lengthening, he arrived earlier and departed later.</p><p>One day Cosette chanced to say &ldquo;father&rdquo; to him. A flash of joy illuminatedJean Valjean&rsquo;s melancholy old countenance. He caught her up: &ldquo;Say Jean.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ah!truly,&rdquo; she replied with a burst of laughter, &ldquo;Monsieur Jean.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thatis right,&rdquo; said he. And he turned aside so that she might not see him wipehis eyes.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0358" id="link2HCH0358"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;THEY RECALL THE GARDEN OF THE RUE PLUMET</h3><p>This was the last time. After that last flash of light, completeextinction ensued. No more familiarity, no more good-morning with a kiss,never more that word so profoundly sweet: &ldquo;My father!&rdquo; He was at his ownrequest and through his own complicity driven out of all his happinessesone after the other; and he had this sorrow, that after having lostCosette wholly in one day, he was afterwards obliged to lose her again indetail.</p><p>The eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar. In short,it sufficed for him to have an apparition of Cosette every day. His wholelife was concentrated in that one hour.</p><p>He seated himself close to her, he gazed at her in silence, or he talkedto her of years gone by, of her childhood, of the convent, of her littlefriends of those bygone days.</p><p>One afternoon,&mdash;it was on one of those early days in April, alreadywarm and fresh, the moment of the sun&rsquo;s great gayety, the gardens whichsurrounded the windows of Marius and Cosette felt the emotion of waking,the hawthorn was on the point of budding, a jewelled garniture ofgillyflowers spread over the ancient walls, snapdragons yawned through thecrevices of the stones, amid the grass there was a charming beginning ofdaisies, and buttercups, the white butterflies of the year were makingtheir first appearance, the wind, that minstrel of the eternal wedding,was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand, auroral symphonywhich the old poets called the springtide,&mdash;Marius said to Cosette:&mdash;&ldquo;Wesaid that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the Rue Plumet.Let us go thither. We must not be ungrateful.&rdquo;&mdash;And away theyflitted, like two swallows towards the spring. This garden of the RuePlumet produced on them the effect of the dawn. They already had behindthem in life something which was like the springtime of their love. Thehouse in the Rue Plumet being held on a lease, still belonged to Cosette.They went to that garden and that house. There they found themselvesagain, there they forgot themselves. That evening, at the usual hour, JeanValjean came to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.&mdash;&ldquo;Madame went outwith Monsieur and has not yet returned,&rdquo; Basque said to him. He seatedhimself in silence, and waited an hour. Cosette did not return. Hedeparted with drooping head.</p><p>Cosette was so intoxicated with her walk to &ldquo;their garden,&rdquo; and so joyousat having &ldquo;lived a whole day in her past,&rdquo; that she talked of nothing elseon the morrow. She did not notice that she had not seen Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;In what way did you go thither?&rdquo; Jean Valjean asked her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;On foot.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And how did you return?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In a hackney carriage.&rdquo;</p><p>For some time, Jean Valjean had noticed the economical life led by theyoung people. He was troubled by it. Marius&rsquo; economy was severe, and thatword had its absolute meaning for Jean Valjean. He hazarded a query:</p><p>&ldquo;Why do you not have a carriage of your own? A pretty coupé would onlycost you five hundred francs a month. You are rich.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Cosette.</p><p>&ldquo;It is like Toussaint,&rdquo; resumed Jean Valjean. &ldquo;She is gone. You have notreplaced her. Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nicolette suffices.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you ought to have a maid.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Have I not Marius?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You ought to have a house of your own, your own servants, a carriage, abox at the theatre. There is nothing too fine for you. Why not profit byyour riches? Wealth adds to happiness.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette made no reply.</p><p>Jean Valjean&rsquo;s visits were not abridged. Far from it. When it is the heartwhich is slipping, one does not halt on the downward slope.</p><p>When Jean Valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce forgetfulnessof the hour, he sang the praises of Marius; he pronounced him handsome,noble, courageous, witty, eloquent, good. Cosette outdid him. Jean Valjeanbegan again. They were never weary. Marius&mdash;that word wasinexhaustible; those six letters contained volumes. In this manner, JeanValjean contrived to remain a long time.</p><p>It was so sweet to see Cosette, to forget by her side! It alleviated hiswounds. It frequently happened that Basque came twice to announce: &ldquo;M.Gillenormand sends me to remind Madame la Baronne that dinner is served.&rdquo;</p><p>On those days, Jean Valjean was very thoughtful on his return home.</p><p>Was there, then, any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which hadpresented itself to the mind of Marius? Was Jean Valjean really achrysalis who would persist, and who would come to visit his butterfly?</p><p>One day he remained still longer than usual. On the following day heobserved that there was no fire on the hearth.&mdash;&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he thought.&ldquo;No fire.&rdquo;&mdash;And he furnished the explanation for himself.&mdash;&ldquo;Itis perfectly simple. It is April. The cold weather has ceased.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Heavens! how cold it is here!&rdquo; exclaimed Cosette when she entered.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;Was it you who told Basque not to make a fire then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, since we are now in the month of May.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But we have a fire until June. One is needed all the year in thiscellar.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I thought that a fire was unnecessary.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is exactly like one of your ideas!&rdquo; retorted Cosette.</p><p>On the following day there was a fire. But the two armchairs werearranged at the other end of the room near the door. &ldquo;&mdash;What is themeaning of this?&rdquo; thought Jean Valjean.</p><p>He went for the armchairs and restored them to their ordinary place nearthe hearth.</p><p>This fire lighted once more encouraged him, however. He prolonged theconversation even beyond its customary limits. As he rose to take hisleave, Cosette said to him:</p><p>&ldquo;My husband said a queer thing to me yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He said to me: &lsquo;Cosette, we have an income of thirty thousand livres.Twenty-seven that you own, and three that my grandfather gives me.&rsquo; Ireplied: &lsquo;That makes thirty.&rsquo; He went on: &lsquo;Would you have the courage tolive on the three thousand?&rsquo; I answered: &lsquo;Yes, on nothing. Provided thatit was with you.&rsquo; And then I asked: &lsquo;Why do you say that to me?&rsquo; Hereplied: &lsquo;I wanted to know.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean found not a word to answer. Cosette probably expected someexplanation from him; he listened in gloomy silence. He went back to theRue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé; he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the doorand instead of entering his own house, he entered the adjoining dwelling.It was only after having ascended nearly two stories that he perceived hiserror and went down again.</p><p>His mind was swarming with conjectures. It was evident that Marius had hisdoubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs, that he fearedsome source that was not pure, who knows? that he had even, perhaps,discovered that the money came from him, Jean Valjean, that he hesitatedbefore this suspicious fortune, and was disinclined to take it as his own,&mdash;preferringthat both he and Cosette should remain poor, rather than that they shouldbe rich with wealth that was not clean.</p><p>Moreover, Jean Valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shownthe door.</p><p>On the following day, he underwent something like a shock on entering theground-floor room. The armchairs had disappeared. There was not a singlechair of any sort.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, what&rsquo;s this!&rdquo; exclaimed Cosette as she entered, &ldquo;no chairs! Where arethe armchairs?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are no longer here,&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;This is too much!&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean stammered:</p><p>&ldquo;It was I who told Basque to remove them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And your reason?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have only a few minutes to stay to-day.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A brief stay is no reason for remaining standing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think that Basque needed the chairs for the drawing-room.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You have company this evening, no doubt.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We expect no one.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean had not another word to say.</p><p>Cosette shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>&ldquo;To have the chairs carried off! The other day you had the fire put out.How odd you are!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Adieu!&rdquo; murmured Jean Valjean.</p><p>He did not say: &ldquo;Adieu, Cosette.&rdquo; But he had not the strength to say:&ldquo;Adieu, Madame.&rdquo;</p><p>He went away utterly overwhelmed.</p><p>This time he had understood.</p><p>On the following day he did not come. Cosette only observed the fact inthe evening.</p><p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;Monsieur Jean has not been here today.&rdquo;</p><p>And she felt a slight twinge at her heart, but she hardly perceived it,being immediately diverted by a kiss from Marius.</p><p>On the following day he did not come.</p><p>Cosette paid no heed to this, passed her evening and slept well thatnight, as usual, and thought of it only when she woke. She was so happy!She speedily despatched Nicolette to M. Jean&rsquo;s house to inquire whether hewere ill, and why he had not come on the previous evening. Nicolettebrought back the reply of M. Jean that he was not ill. He was busy. Hewould come soon. As soon as he was able. Moreover, he was on the point oftaking a little journey. Madame must remember that it was his custom totake trips from time to time. They were not to worry about him. They werenot to think of him.</p><p>Nicolette on entering M. Jean&rsquo;s had repeated to him her mistress&rsquo; verywords. That Madame had sent her to inquire why M. Jean had not come on thepreceding evening. &rdquo;&mdash;It is two days since I have been there,&rdquo; saidJean Valjean gently.</p><p>But the remark passed unnoticed by Nicolette, who did not report it toCosette.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0359" id="link2HCH0359"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;ATTRACTION AND EXTINCTION</h3><p>During the last months of spring and the first months of summer in 1833,the rare passers-by in the Marais, the petty shopkeepers, the loungers onthresholds, noticed an old man neatly clad in black, who emerged every dayat the same hour, towards nightfall, from the Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé, on theside of the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, passed in front of theBlancs Manteaux, gained the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine, and, on arrivingat the Rue de l&rsquo;Écharpe, turned to the left, and entered the RueSaint-Louis.</p><p>There he walked at a slow pace, with his head strained forward, seeingnothing, hearing nothing, his eye immovably fixed on a point which seemedto be a star to him, which never varied, and which was no other than thecorner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. The nearer he approached thecorner of the street the more his eye lighted up; a sort of joyilluminated his pupils like an inward aurora, he had a fascinated and muchaffected air, his lips indulged in obscure movements, as though he weretalking to some one whom he did not see, he smiled vaguely and advanced asslowly as possible. One would have said that, while desirous of reachinghis destination, he feared the moment when he should be close at hand.When only a few houses remained between him and that street which appearedto attract him his pace slackened, to such a degree that, at times, onemight have thought that he was no longer advancing at all. The vacillationof his head and the fixity of his eyeballs suggested the thought of themagnetic needle seeking the pole. Whatever time he spent on arriving, hewas obliged to arrive at last; he reached the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire;then he halted, he trembled, he thrust his head with a sort of melancholytimidity round the corner of the last house, and gazed into that street,and there was in that tragic look something which resembled the dazzlinglight of the impossible, and the reflection from a paradise that wasclosed to him. Then a tear, which had slowly gathered in the corner of hislids, and had become large enough to fall, trickled down his cheek, andsometimes stopped at his mouth. The old man tasted its bitter flavor. Thushe remained for several minutes as though made of stone, then he returnedby the same road and with the same step, and, in proportion as heretreated, his glance died out.</p><p>Little by little, this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of theRue des Filles-du-Calvaire; he halted half way in the Rue Saint-Louis;sometimes a little further off, sometimes a little nearer.</p><p>One day he stopped at the corner of the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine andlooked at the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire from a distance. Then he shookhis head slowly from right to left, as though refusing himself something,and retraced his steps.</p><p>Soon he no longer came as far as the Rue Saint-Louis. He got as far as theRue Pavée, shook his head and turned back; then he went no further thanthe Rue des Trois-Pavillons; then he did not overstep the Blancs-Manteaux.One would have said that he was a pendulum which was no longer wound up,and whose oscillations were growing shorter before ceasing altogether.</p><p>Every day he emerged from his house at the same hour, he undertook thesame trip, but he no longer completed it, and, perhaps without himselfbeing aware of the fact, he constantly shortened it. His whole countenanceexpressed this single idea: What is the use?&mdash;His eye was dim; nomore radiance. His tears were also exhausted; they no longer collected inthe corner of his eye-lid; that thoughtful eye was dry. The old man&rsquo;s headwas still craned forward; his chin moved at times; the folds in his gauntneck were painful to behold. Sometimes, when the weather was bad, he hadan umbrella under his arm, but he never opened it.</p><p>The good women of the quarter said: &ldquo;He is an innocent.&rdquo; The childrenfollowed him and laughed.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2H_4_0416" id="link2H_4_0416"></a>BOOK NINTH&mdash;SUPREME SHADOW, SUPREME DAWN</h3></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0360" id="link2HCH0360"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;PITY FOR THE UNHAPPY, BUT INDULGENCE FOR THE HAPPY</h3><p>It is a terrible thing to be happy!

Fauchelevent, and, since that time, he had feared to put any to JeanValjean. He had regretted the promise into which he had allowed himself tobe drawn. He had often said to himself that he had done wrong in makingthat concession to despair. He had confined himself to graduallyestranging Jean Valjean from his house and to effacing him, as much aspossible, from Cosette&rsquo;s mind. He had, in a manner, always placed himselfbetween Cosette and Jean Valjean, sure that, in this way, she would notperceive nor think of the latter. It was more than effacement, it was aneclipse.</p><p>Marius did what he considered necessary and just. He thought that he hadserious reasons which the reader has already seen, and others which willbe seen later on, for getting rid of Jean Valjean without harshness, butwithout weakness.</p><p>Chance having ordained that he should encounter, in a case which he hadargued, a former employee of the Laffitte establishment, he had acquiredmysterious information, without seeking it, which he had not been able, itis true, to probe, out of respect for the secret which he had promised toguard, and out of consideration for Jean Valjean&rsquo;s perilous position. Hebelieved at that moment that he had a grave duty to perform: therestitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some one whom he soughtwith all possible discretion. In the meanwhile, he abstained from touchingthat money.</p><p>As for Cosette, she had not been initiated into any of these secrets; butit would be harsh to condemn her also.</p><p>There existed between Marius and her an all-powerful magnetism, whichcaused her to do, instinctively and almost mechanically, what Mariuswished. She was conscious of Marius&rsquo; will in the direction of &ldquo;MonsieurJean,&rdquo; she conformed to it. Her husband had not been obliged to sayanything to her; she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his tacitintentions, and obeyed blindly. Her obedience in this instance consistedin not remembering what Marius forgot. She was not obliged to make anyeffort to accomplish this. Without her knowing why herself, and withouthis having any cause to accuse her of it, her soul had become so whollyher husband&rsquo;s that that which was shrouded in gloom in Marius&rsquo; mind becameovercast in hers.</p><p>Let us not go too far, however; in what concerns Jean Valjean, thisforgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial. She was ratherheedless than forgetful. At bottom, she was sincerely attached to the manwhom she had so long called her father; but she loved her husband stillmore dearly. This was what had somewhat disturbed the balance of herheart, which leaned to one side only.</p><p>It sometimes happened that Cosette spoke of Jean Valjean and expressed hersurprise. Then Marius calmed her: &ldquo;He is absent, I think. Did not he saythat he was setting out on a journey?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; thoughtCosette. &ldquo;He had a habit of disappearing in this fashion. But not for solong.&rdquo; Two or three times she despatched Nicolette to inquire in the Ruede l&rsquo;Homme Armé whether M. Jean had returned from his journey. JeanValjean caused the answer &ldquo;no&rdquo; to be given.</p><p>Cosette asked nothing more, since she had but one need on earth, Marius.</p><p>Let us also say that, on their side, Cosette and Marius had also beenabsent. They had been to Vernon. Marius had taken Cosette to his father&rsquo;sgrave.</p><p>Marius gradually won Cosette away from Jean Valjean. Cosette allowed it.</p><p>Moreover that which is called, far too harshly in certain cases, theingratitude of children, is not always a thing so deserving of reproach asit is supposed. It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we haveelsewhere said, &ldquo;looks before her.&rdquo; Nature divides living beings intothose who are arriving and those who are departing. Those who aredeparting are turned towards the shadows, those who are arriving towardsthe light. Hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old, andinvoluntary on the part of the young. This breach, at first insensible,increases slowly, like all separations of branches. The boughs, withoutbecoming detached from the trunk, grow away from it. It is no fault oftheirs. Youth goes where there is joy, festivals, vivid lights, love. Oldage goes towards the end. They do not lose sight of each other, but thereis no longer a close connection. Young people feel the cooling off oflife; old people, that of the tomb. Let us not blame these poor children.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0361" id="link2HCH0361"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;LAST FLICKERINGS OF A LAMP WITHOUT OIL</h3><p>One day, Jean Valjean descended his staircase, took three steps in thestreet, seated himself on a post, on that same stone post where Gavrochehad found him meditating on the night between the 5th and the 6th of June;he remained there a few moments, then went upstairs again. This was thelast oscillation of the pendulum. On the following day he did not leavehis apartment. On the day after that, he did not leave his bed.</p><p>His portress, who prepared his scanty repasts, a few cabbages or potatoeswith bacon, glanced at the brown earthenware plate and exclaimed:</p><p>&ldquo;But you ate nothing yesterday, poor, dear man!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly I did,&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;The plate is quite full.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Look at the water jug. It is empty.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That proves that you have drunk; it does not prove that you have eaten.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, &ldquo;what if I felt hungry only for water?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is called thirst, and, when one does not eat at the same time, it iscalled fever.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will eat to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Or at Trinity day. Why not to-day? Is it the thing to say: &lsquo;I will eatto-morrow&rsquo;? The idea of leaving my platter without even touching it! Mylady-finger potatoes were so good!&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean took the old woman&rsquo;s hand:</p><p>&ldquo;I promise you that I will eat them,&rdquo; he said, in his benevolent voice.</p><p>&ldquo;I am not pleased with you,&rdquo; replied the portress.</p><p>Jean Valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman. There arestreets in Paris through which no one ever passes, and houses to which noone ever comes. He was in one of those streets and one of those houses.</p><p>While he still went out, he had purchased of a coppersmith, for a fewsous, a little copper crucifix which he had hung up on a nail opposite hisbed. That gibbet is always good to look at.</p><p>A week passed, and Jean Valjean had not taken a step in his room. He stillremained in bed. The portress said to her husband:&mdash;&ldquo;The good manupstairs yonder does not get up, he no longer eats, he will not last long.That man has his sorrows, that he has. You won&rsquo;t get it out of my headthat his daughter has made a bad marriage.&rdquo;</p><p>The porter replied, with the tone of marital sovereignty:</p><p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s rich, let him have a doctor. If he is not rich, let him gowithout. If he has no doctor he will die.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And if he has one?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He will die,&rdquo; said the porter.</p><p>The portress set to scraping away the grass from what she called herpavement, with an old knife, and, as she tore out the blades, shegrumbled:</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame. Such a neat old man! He&rsquo;s as white as a chicken.&rdquo;</p><p>She caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end of thestreet; she took it upon herself to request him to come upstairs.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on the second floor,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You have only to enter. As the goodman no longer stirs from his bed, the door is always unlocked.&rdquo;</p><p>The doctor saw Jean Valjean and spoke with him.</p><p>When he came down again the portress interrogated him:</p><p>&ldquo;Well, doctor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Your sick man is very ill indeed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is the matter with him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Everything and nothing. He is a man who, to all appearances, has lostsome person who is dear to him. People die of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He told me that he was in good health.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Shall you come again, doctor?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;But some one else besides must come.&rdquo;</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0362" id="link2HCH0362"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;A PEN IS HEAVY TO THE MAN WHO LIFTED THE FAUCHELEVENT&rsquo;SCART</h3><p>One evening Jean Valjean found difficulty in raising himself on his elbow;he felt of his wrist and could not find his pulse; his breath was shortand halted at times; he recognized the fact that he was weaker than he hadever been before. Then, no doubt under the pressure of some supremepreoccupation, he made an effort, drew himself up into a sitting postureand dressed himself. He put on his old workingman&rsquo;s clothes. As he nolonger went out, he had returned to them and preferred them. He wasobliged to pause many times while dressing himself; merely putting hisarms through his waistcoat made the perspiration trickle from hisforehead.</p><p>Since he had been alone, he had placed his bed in the antechamber, inorder to inhabit that deserted apartment as little as possible.</p><p>He opened the valise and drew from it Cosette&rsquo;s outfit.</p><p>He spread it out on his bed.</p><p>The Bishop&rsquo;s candlesticks were in their place on the chimney-piece. Hetook from a drawer two wax candles and put them in the candlesticks. Then,although it was still broad daylight,&mdash;it was summer,&mdash;helighted them. In the same way candles are to be seen lighted in broaddaylight in chambers where there is a corpse.</p><p>Every step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to anotherexhausted him, and he was obliged to sit down. It was not ordinary fatiguewhich expends the strength only to renew it; it was the remnant of allmovement possible to him, it was life drained which flows away drop bydrop in overwhelming efforts and which will never be renewed.</p><p>The chair into which he allowed himself to fall was placed in front ofthat mirror, so fatal for him, so providential for Marius, in which he hadread Cosette&rsquo;s reversed writing on the blotting book. He caught sight ofhimself in this mirror, and did not recognize himself. He was eighty yearsold; before Marius&rsquo; marriage, he would have hardly been taken for fifty;that year had counted for thirty. What he bore on his brow was no longerthe wrinkles of age, it was the mysterious mark of death. The hollowing ofthat pitiless nail could be felt there. His cheeks were pendulous; theskin of his face had the color which would lead one to think that italready had earth upon it; the corners of his mouth drooped as in the maskwhich the ancients sculptured on tombs. He gazed into space with an air ofreproach; one would have said that he was one of those grand tragic beingswho have cause to complain of some one.</p><p>He was in that condition, the last phase of dejection, in which sorrow nolonger flows; it is coagulated, so to speak; there is something on thesoul like a clot of despair.</p><p>Night had come. He laboriously dragged a table and the old armchair tothe fireside, and placed upon the table a pen, some ink and some paper.</p><p>That done, he had a fainting fit. When he recovered consciousness, he wasthirsty. As he could not lift the jug, he tipped it over painfully towardshis mouth, and swallowed a draught.</p><p>As neither the pen nor the ink had been used for a long time, the point ofthe pen had curled up, the ink had dried away, he was forced to rise andput a few drops of water in the ink, which he did not accomplish withoutpausing and sitting down two or three times, and he was compelled to writewith the back of the pen. He wiped his brow from time to time.</p><p>Then he turned towards the bed, and, still seated, for he could not stand,he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects.</p><p>These contemplations lasted for hours which seemed minutes.</p><p>All at once he shivered, he felt that a child was taking possession ofhim; he rested his elbows on the table, which was illuminated by theBishop&rsquo;s candles and took up the pen. His hand trembled. He wrote slowlythe few following lines:</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette, I bless thee. I am going to explain to thee. Thy husband wasright in giving me to understand that I ought to go away; but there is alittle error in what he believed, though he was in the right. He isexcellent. Love him well even after I am dead. Monsieur Pontmercy, love mydarling child well. Cosette, this paper will be found; this is what I wishto say to thee, thou wilt see the figures, if I have the strength torecall them, listen well, this money is really thine. Here is the wholematter: White jet comes from Norway, black jet comes from England, blackglass jewellery comes from Germany. Jet is the lightest, the mostprecious, the most costly. Imitations can be made in France as well as inGermany. What is needed is a little anvil two inches square, and a lampburning spirits of wine to soften the wax. The wax was formerly made withresin and lampblack, and cost four livres the pound. I invented a way ofmaking it with gum shellac and turpentine. It does not cost more thanthirty sous, and is much better. Buckles are made with a violet glasswhich is stuck fast, by means of this wax, to a little framework of blackiron. The glass must be violet for iron jewellery, and black for goldjewellery. Spain buys a great deal of it. It is the country of jet . . .&rdquo;</p><p>Here he paused, the pen fell from his fingers, he was seized by one ofthose sobs which at times welled up from the very depths of his being; thepoor man clasped his head in both hands, and meditated.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed within himself [lamentable cries, heard by God alone],&ldquo;all is over. I shall never see her more. She is a smile which passed overme. I am about to plunge into the night without even seeing her again. Oh!one minute, one instant, to hear her voice, to touch her dress, to gazeupon her, upon her, the angel! and then to die! It is nothing to die, whatis frightful is to die without seeing her. She would smile on me, shewould say a word to me, would that do any harm to any one? No, all isover, and forever. Here I am all alone. My God! My God! I shall never seeher again!&rdquo; At that moment there came a knock at the door.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0363" id="link2HCH0363"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;A BOTTLE OF INK WHICH ONLY SUCCEEDED IN WHITENING</h3><p>That same day, or to speak more accurately, that same evening, as Mariusleft the table, and was on the point of withdrawing to his study, having acase to look over, Basque handed him a letter saying: &ldquo;The person whowrote the letter is in the antechamber.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette had taken the grandfather&rsquo;s arm and was strolling in the garden.</p><p>A letter, like a man, may have an unprepossessing exterior. Coarse paper,coarsely folded&mdash;the very sight of certain missives is displeasing.</p><p>The letter which Basque had brought was of this sort.</p><p>Marius took it. It smelled of tobacco. Nothing evokes a memory like anodor. Marius recognized that tobacco. He looked at the superscription: &ldquo;ToMonsieur, Monsieur le Baron Pommerci. At his hotel.&rdquo; The recognition ofthe tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well. It may be saidthat amazement has its lightning flashes.</p><p>Marius was, as it were, illuminated by one of these flashes.</p><p>The sense of smell, that mysterious aid to memory, had just revived awhole world within him. This was certainly the paper, the fashion offolding, the dull tint of ink; it was certainly the well-knownhandwriting, especially was it the same tobacco.</p><p>The Jondrette garret rose before his mind.</p><p>Thus, strange freak of chance! one of the two scents which he had sodiligently sought, the one in connection with which he had lately againexerted so many efforts and which he supposed to be forever lost, had comeand presented itself to him of its own accord.</p><p>He eagerly broke the seal, and read:</p><p class="letter">&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron:&mdash;If the Supreme Being had given me the talents,I might have been baron Thénard, member of the Institute [acadenmy of ciences],but I am not. I only bear the same as him, happy if this memory recommends meto the eccellence of your kindnesses. The benefit with which you will honor mewill be reciprocle. I am in possession of a secret concerning an individual.This individual concerns you. I hold the secret at your disposal desiring tohave the honor to be huseful to you. I will furnish you with the simple meansof driving from your honorabel family that individual who has no right there,madame la baronne being of lofty birth. The sanctuary of virtue cannot cohabitlonger with crime without abdicating.<br/>    &ldquo;I awate in the entichamber the orders of monsieur le baron.</p><p class="right">&ldquo;With respect.&rdquo;</p><p>The letter was signed &ldquo;Thénard.&rdquo;</p><p>This signature was not false. It was merely a trifle abridged.</p><p>Moreover, the rigmarole and the orthography completed the revelation. Thecertificate of origin was complete.</p><p>Marius&rsquo; emotion was profound. After a start of surprise, he underwent afeeling of happiness. If he could now but find that other man of whom hewas in search, the man who had saved him, Marius, there would be nothingleft for him to desire.</p><p>He opened the drawer of his secretary, took out several bank-notes, putthem in his pocket, closed the secretary again, and rang the bell. Basquehalf opened the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Show the man in,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>Basque announced:</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur Thénard.&rdquo;</p><p>A man entered.</p><p>A fresh surprise for Marius. The man who entered was an utter stranger tohim.</p><p>This man, who was old, moreover, had a thick nose, his chin swathed in acravat, green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over hiseyes, and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow on a levelwith his eyebrows like the wigs of English coachmen in &ldquo;high life.&rdquo; Hishair was gray. He was dressed in black from head to foot, in garments thatwere very threadbare but clean; a bunch of seals depending from his fobsuggested the idea of a watch. He held in his hand an old hat! He walkedin a bent attitude, and the curve in his spine augmented the profundity ofhis bow.</p><p>The first thing that struck the observer was, that this personage&rsquo;s coat,which was too ample although carefully buttoned, had not been made forhim.</p><p>Here a short digression becomes necessary.</p><p>There was in Paris at that epoch, in a low-lived old lodging in the RueBeautreillis, near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew whose profession was tochange villains into honest men. Not for too long, which might have provedembarrassing for the villain. The change was on sight, for a day or two,at the rate of thirty sous a day, by means of a costume which resembledthe honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible. This costumerwas called &ldquo;the Changer&rdquo;; the pickpockets of Paris had given him this nameand knew him by no other. He had a tolerably complete wardrobe. The ragswith which he tricked out people were almost probable. He had specialtiesand categories; on each nail of his shop hung a social status, threadbareand worn; here the suit of a magistrate, there the outfit of a Curé,beyond the outfit of a banker, in one corner the costume of a retiredmilitary man, elsewhere the habiliments of a man of letters, and furtheron the dress of a statesman.</p><p>This creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays inParis. His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged, and into whichroguery retreated. A tattered knave arrived at this dressing-room,deposited his thirty sous and selected, according to the part which hewished to play, the costume which suited him, and on descending the stairsonce more, the knave was a somebody. On the following day, the clotheswere faithfully returned, and the Changer, who trusted the thieves witheverything, was never robbed. There was one inconvenience about theseclothes, they &ldquo;did not fit&rdquo;; not having been made for those who wore them,they were too tight for one, too loose for another and did not adjustthemselves to any one. Every pickpocket who exceeded or fell short of thehuman average was ill at his ease in the Changer&rsquo;s costumes. It wasnecessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean. The Changerhad foreseen only ordinary men. He had taken the measure of the speciesfrom the first rascal who came to hand, who is neither stout nor thin,neither tall nor short. Hence adaptations which were sometimes difficultand from which the Changer&rsquo;s clients extricated themselves as best theymight. So much the worse for the exceptions! The suit of the statesman,for instance, black from head to foot, and consequently proper, would havebeen too large for Pitt and too small for Castelcicala. The costume of astatesman was designated as follows in the Changer&rsquo;s catalogue; we copy:</p><p>&ldquo;A coat of black cloth, trowsers of black wool, a silk waistcoat, bootsand linen.&rdquo; On the margin there stood: <i>ex-ambassador</i>, and a note which wealso copy: &ldquo;In a separate box, a neatly frizzed peruke, green glasses,seals, and two small quills an inch long, wrapped in cotton.&rdquo; All thisbelonged to the statesman, the ex-ambassador. This whole costume was, ifwe may so express ourselves, debilitated; the seams were white, a vaguebutton-hole yawned at one of the elbows; moreover, one of the coat buttonswas missing on the breast; but this was only detail; as the hand of thestatesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid upon his heart,its function was to conceal the absent button.</p><p>If Marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of Paris, hewould instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom Basquehad just shown in, the statesman&rsquo;s suit borrowed from thepick-me-down-that shop of the Changer.</p><p>Marius&rsquo; disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom heexpected to see turned to the newcomer&rsquo;s disadvantage.</p><p>He surveyed him from head to foot, while that personage made exaggeratedbows, and demanded in a curt tone:</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>The man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of acrocodile will furnish some idea:</p><p>&ldquo;It seems to me impossible that I should not have already had the honor ofseeing Monsieur le Baron in society. I think I actually did meet monsieurpersonally, several years ago, at the house of Madame la PrincesseBagration and in the drawing-rooms of his Lordship the Vicomte Dambray,peer of France.&rdquo;</p><p>It is always a good bit of tactics in knavery to pretend to recognize someone whom one does not know.</p><p>Marius paid attention to the manner of this man&rsquo;s speech. He spied on hisaccent and gesture, but his disappointment increased; the pronunciationwas nasal and absolutely unlike the dry, shrill tone which he hadexpected.</p><p>He was utterly routed.</p><p>&ldquo;I know neither Madame Bagration nor M. Dambray,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have neverset foot in the house of either of them in my life.&rdquo;</p><p>The reply was ungracious. The personage, determined to be gracious at anycost, insisted.</p><p>&ldquo;Then it must have been at Chateaubriand&rsquo;s that I have seen Monsieur! Iknow Chateaubriand very well. He is very affable. He sometimes says to me:‘Thénard, my friend . . . won&rsquo;t you drink a glass of wine with me?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Marius&rsquo; brow grew more and more severe:</p><p>&ldquo;I have never had the honor of being received by M. de Chateaubriand. Letus cut it short. What do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>The man bowed lower at that harsh voice.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron, deign to listen to me. There is in America, in adistrict near Panama, a village called la Joya. That village is composedof a single house, a large, square house of three stories, built of bricksdried in the sun, each side of the square five hundred feet in length,each story retreating twelve feet back of the story below, in such amanner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the circuit of theedifice, in the centre an inner court where the provisions and munitionsare kept; no windows, loopholes, no doors, ladders, ladders to mount fromthe ground to the first terrace, and from the first to the second, andfrom the second to the third, ladders to descend into the inner court, nodoors to the chambers, trap-doors, no staircases to the chambers, ladders;in the evening the traps are closed, the ladders are withdrawn, carbinesand blunderbusses trained from the loopholes; no means of entering, ahouse by day, a citadel by night, eight hundred inhabitants,&mdash;that isthe village. Why so many precautions? because the country is dangerous; itis full of cannibals. Then why do people go there? because the country ismarvellous; gold is found there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are you driving at?&rdquo; interrupted Marius, who had passed fromdisappointment to impatience.</p><p>&ldquo;At this, Monsieur le Baron. I am an old and weary diplomat. Ancientcivilization has thrown me on my own devices. I want to try savages.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron, egotism is the law of the world. The proletarianpeasant woman, who toils by the day, turns round when the diligence passesby, the peasant proprietress, who toils in her field, does not turn round.The dog of the poor man barks at the rich man, the dog of the rich manbarks at the poor man. Each one for himself. Self-interest&mdash;that&rsquo;sthe object of men. Gold, that&rsquo;s the loadstone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What then? Finish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I should like to go and establish myself at la Joya. There are three ofus. I have my spouse and my young lady; a very beautiful girl. The journeyis long and costly. I need a little money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What concern is that of mine?&rdquo; demanded Marius.</p><p>The stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat, a gesturecharacteristic of the vulture, and replied with an augmented smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Has not Monsieur le Baron perused my letter?&rdquo;</p><p>There was some truth in this. The fact is, that the contents of theepistle had slipped Marius&rsquo; mind. He had seen the writing rather than readthe letter. He could hardly recall it. But a moment ago a fresh start hadbeen given him. He had noted that detail: &ldquo;my spouse and my young lady.&rdquo;</p><p>He fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger. An examining judge couldnot have done the look better. He almost lay in wait for him.</p><p>He confined himself to replying:</p><p>&ldquo;State the case precisely.&rdquo;</p><p>The stranger inserted his two hands in both his fobs, drew himself upwithout straightening his dorsal column, but scrutinizing Marius in histurn, with the green gaze of his spectacles.</p><p>&ldquo;So be it, Monsieur le Baron. I will be precise. I have a secret to sellto you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A secret?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A secret.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Which concerns me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Somewhat.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is the secret?&rdquo;</p><p>Marius scrutinized the man more and more as he listened to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I commence gratis,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;You will see that I aminteresting.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Speak.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron, you have in your house a thief and an assassin.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius shuddered.</p><p>&ldquo;In my house? no,&rdquo; said he.</p><p>The imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow and went on:</p><p>&ldquo;An assassin and a thief. Remark, Monsieur le Baron, that I do not herespeak of ancient deeds, deeds of the past which have lapsed, which can beeffaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before God. I speakof recent deeds, of actual facts as still unknown to justice at this hour.I continue. This man has insinuated himself into your confidence, andalmost into your family under a false name. I am about to tell you hisreal name. And to tell it to you for nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am listening.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;His name is Jean Valjean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am going to tell you, equally for nothing, who he is.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Say on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is an ex-convict.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You know it since I have had the honor of telling you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No. I knew it before.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius&rsquo; cold tone, that double reply of &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; his laconicism, whichwas not favorable to dialogue, stirred up some smouldering wrath in thestranger. He launched a furious glance on the sly at Marius, which wasinstantly extinguished. Rapid as it was, this glance was of the kind whicha man recognizes when he has once beheld it; it did not escape Marius.Certain flashes can only proceed from certain souls; the eye, thatvent-hole of the thought, glows with it; spectacles hide nothing; tryputting a pane of glass over hell!</p><p>The stranger resumed with a smile:</p><p>&ldquo;I will not permit myself to contradict Monsieur le Baron. In any case,you ought to perceive that I am well informed. Now what I have to tell youis known to myself alone. This concerns the fortune of Madame la Baronne.It is an extraordinary secret. It is for sale&mdash;I make you the firstoffer of it. Cheap. Twenty thousand francs.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I know that secret as well as the others,&rdquo; said Marius.</p><p>The personage felt the necessity of lowering his price a trifle.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron, say ten thousand francs and I will speak.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me. I know whatyou wish to say to me.&rdquo;</p><p>A fresh flash gleamed in the man&rsquo;s eye. He exclaimed:</p><p>&ldquo;But I must dine to-day, nevertheless. It is an extraordinary secret, Itell you. Monsieur le Baron, I will speak. I speak. Give me twentyfrancs.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius gazed intently at him:</p><p>&ldquo;I know your extraordinary secret, just as I knew Jean Valjean&rsquo;s name,just as I know your name.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My name?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is not difficult, Monsieur le Baron. I had the honor to write to youand to tell it to you. Thénard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;&mdash;Dier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hey?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thénardier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p><p>In danger the porcupine bristles up, the beetle feigns death, the oldguard forms in a square; this man burst into laughter.</p><p>Then he flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat with a fillip.</p><p>Marius continued:</p><p>&ldquo;You are also Jondrette the workman, Fabantou the comedian, Genflot thepoet, Don Alvarès the Spaniard, and Mistress Balizard.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mistress what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you kept a pot-house at Montfermeil.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A pot-house! Never.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I tell you that your name is Thénardier.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I deny it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And that you are a rascal. Here.&rdquo;</p><p>And Marius drew a bank-note from his pocket and flung it in his face.</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks! Pardon me! five hundred francs! Monsieur le Baron!&rdquo;</p><p>And the man, overcome, bowed, seized the note and examined it.</p><p>&ldquo;Five hundred francs!&rdquo; he began again, taken aback. And hestammered in a low voice: &ldquo;An honest rustler.&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-69" name="linknoteref-69" id="linknoteref-69">69</a></p><p>Then brusquely:</p><p>&ldquo;Well, so be it!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Let us put ourselves at our ease.&rdquo;</p><p>And with the agility of a monkey, flinging back his hair, tearing off hisspectacles, and withdrawing from his nose by sleight of hand the twoquills of which mention was recently made, and which the reader has alsomet with on another page of this book, he took off his face as the mantakes off his hat.</p><p>His eye lighted up; his uneven brow, with hollows in some places and bumpsin others, hideously wrinkled at the top, was laid bare, his nose hadbecome as sharp as a beak; the fierce and sagacious profile of the man ofprey reappeared.</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron is infallible,&rdquo; he said in a clear voice whence allnasal twang had disappeared, &ldquo;I am Thénardier.&rdquo;</p><p>And he straightened up his crooked back.</p><p>Thénardier, for it was really he, was strangely surprised; he would havebeen troubled, had he been capable of such a thing. He had come to bringastonishment, and it was he who had received it. This humiliation had beenworth five hundred francs to him, and, taking it all in all, he acceptedit; but he was nonetheless bewildered.</p><p>He beheld this Baron Pontmercy for the first time, and, in spite of hisdisguise, this Baron Pontmercy recognized him, and recognized himthoroughly. And not only was this Baron perfectly informed as toThénardier, but he seemed well posted as to Jean Valjean. Who was thisalmost beardless young man, who was so glacial and so generous, who knewpeople&rsquo;s names, who knew all their names, and who opened his purse tothem, who bullied rascals like a judge, and who paid them like a dupe?</p><p>Thénardier, the reader will remember, although he had been Marius&rsquo;neighbor, had never seen him, which is not unusual in Paris; he hadformerly, in a vague way, heard his daughters talk of a very poor youngman named Marius who lived in the house. He had written to him, withoutknowing him, the letter with which the reader is acquainted.</p><p>No connection between that Marius and M. le Baron Pontmercy was possiblein his mind.</p><p>As for the name Pontmercy, it will be recalled that, on the battlefield ofWaterloo, he had only heard the last two syllables, for which he alwaysentertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely anexpression of thanks.</p><p>However, through his daughter Azelma, who had started on the scent of themarried pair on the 16th of February, and through his own personalresearches, he had succeeded in learning many things, and, from the depthsof his own gloom, he had contrived to grasp more than one mysterious clew.He had discovered, by dint of industry, or, at least, by dint ofinduction, he had guessed who the man was whom he had encountered on acertain day in the Grand Sewer. From the man he had easily reached thename. He knew that Madame la Baronne Pontmercy was Cosette. But he meantto be discreet in that quarter.</p><p>Who was Cosette? He did not know exactly himself. He did, indeed, catch aninkling of illegitimacy, the history of Fantine had always seemed to himequivocal; but what was the use of talking about that? in order to causehimself to be paid for his silence? He had, or thought he had, betterwares than that for sale. And, according to all appearances, if he were tocome and make to the Baron Pontmercy this revelation&mdash;and withoutproof: &ldquo;Your wife is a bastard,&rdquo; the only result would be to attract theboot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer.</p><p>From Thénardier&rsquo;s point of view, the conversation with Marius had not yetbegun. He ought to have drawn back, to have modified his strategy, to haveabandoned his position, to have changed his front; but nothing essentialhad been compromised as yet, and he had five hundred francs in his pocket.Moreover, he had something decisive to say, and, even against this verywell-informed and well-armed Baron Pontmercy, he felt himself strong. Formen of Thénardier&rsquo;s nature, every dialogue is a combat. In the one inwhich he was about to engage, what was his situation? He did not know towhom he was speaking, but he did know of what he was speaking, he madethis rapid review of his inner forces, and after having said: &ldquo;I amThénardier,&rdquo; he waited.</p><p>Marius had become thoughtful. So he had hold of Thénardier at last. Thatman whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him. He could honorColonel Pontmercy&rsquo;s recommendation.</p><p>He felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to thisvillain, and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tombby his father upon him, Marius, had been protested up to that day. It alsoseemed to him, in the complex state of his mind towards Thénardier, thatthere was occasion to avenge the Colonel for the misfortune of having beensaved by such a rascal. In any case, he was content. He was about todeliver the Colonel&rsquo;s shade from this unworthy creditor at last, and itseemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his father&rsquo;s memoryfrom the debtors&rsquo; prison. By the side of this duty there was another&mdash;toelucidate, if possible, the source of Cosette&rsquo;s fortune. The opportunityappeared to present itself. Perhaps Thénardier knew something. It mightprove useful to see the bottom of this man.</p><p>He commenced with this.</p><p>Thénardier had caused the &ldquo;honest rustler&rdquo; to disappear in his fob, andwas gazing at Marius with a gentleness that was almost tender.</p><p>Marius broke the silence.</p><p>&ldquo;Thénardier, I have told you your name. Now, would you like to have metell you your secret&mdash;the one that you came here to reveal to me? Ihave information of my own, also. You shall see that I know more about itthan you do. Jean Valjean, as you have said, is an assassin and a thief. Athief, because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer, whose ruin he broughtabout. An assassin, because he assassinated police-agent Javert.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand, sir,&rdquo; ejaculated Thénardier.</p><p>&ldquo;I will make myself intelligible. In a certain arrondissement of the Pasde Calais, there was, in 1822, a man who had fallen out with justice, andwho, under the name of M. Madeleine, had regained his status andrehabilitated himself. This man had become a just man in the full force ofthe term. In a trade, the manufacture of black glass goods, he made thefortune of an entire city. As far as his personal fortune was concerned hemade that also, but as a secondary matter, and in some sort, by accident.He was the foster-father of the poor. He founded hospitals, openedschools, visited the sick, dowered young girls, supported widows, andadopted orphans; he was like the guardian angel of the country. He refusedthe cross, he was appointed Mayor. A liberated convict knew the secret ofa penalty incurred by this man in former days; he denounced him, and hadhim arrested, and profited by the arrest to come to Paris and cause thebanker Laffitte,&mdash;I have the fact from the cashier himself,&mdash;bymeans of a false signature, to hand over to him the sum of over half amillion which belonged to M. Madeleine. This convict who robbed M.Madeleine was Jean Valjean. As for the other fact, you have nothing totell me about it either. Jean Valjean killed the agent Javert; he shot himwith a pistol. I, the person who is speaking to you, was present.&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier cast upon Marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man wholays his hand once more upon the victory, and who has just regained, inone instant, all the ground which he has lost. But the smile returnedinstantly. The inferior&rsquo;s triumph in the presence of his superior must bewheedling.</p><p>Thénardier contented himself with saying to Marius:</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron, we are on the wrong track.&rdquo;</p><p>And he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute anexpressive whirl.</p><p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; broke forth Marius, &ldquo;do you dispute that? These are facts.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are chimæras. The confidence with which Monsieur le Baron honors merenders it my duty to tell him so. Truth and justice before all things. Ido not like to see folks accused unjustly. Monsieur le Baron, Jean Valjeandid not rob M. Madeleine and Jean Valjean did not kill Javert.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is too much! How is this?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;For two reasons.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What are they? Speak.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is the first: he did not rob M. Madeleine, because it is JeanValjean himself who was M. Madeleine.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What tale are you telling me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And this is the second: he did not assassinate Javert, because the personwho killed Javert was Javert.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean to say?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That Javert committed suicide.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Prove it! prove it!&rdquo; cried Marius beside himself.</p><p>Thénardier resumed, scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancientAlexandrine measure:</p><p>&ldquo;Police-agent-Ja-vert-was-found-drowned-un-der-a-boat-of-the-Pont-au-Change.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But prove it!&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper, whichseemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes.</p><p>&ldquo;I have my papers,&rdquo; he said calmly.</p><p>And he added:</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron, in your interests I desired to know Jean Valjeanthoroughly. I say that Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine are one and the sameman, and I say that Javert had no other assassin than Javert. If I speak,it is because I have proofs. Not manuscript proofs&mdash;writing issuspicious, handwriting is complaisant,&mdash;but printed proofs.&rdquo;</p><p>As he spoke, Thénardier extracted from the envelope two copies ofnewspapers, yellow, faded, and strongly saturated with tobacco. One ofthese two newspapers, broken at every fold and falling into rags, seemedmuch older than the other.</p><p>&ldquo;Two facts, two proofs,&rdquo; remarked Thénardier. And he offered the twonewspapers, unfolded, to Marius.</p><p>The reader is acquainted with these two papers. One, the most ancient, anumber of the <i>Drapeau Blanc</i> of the 25th of July, 1823, the text of whichcan be seen in the first volume, established the identity of M. Madeleineand Jean Valjean.</p><p>The other, a <i>Moniteur</i> of the 15th of June, 1832, announced the suicide ofJavert, adding that it appeared from a verbal report of Javert to theprefect that, having been taken prisoner in the barricade of the Rue de laChanvrerie, he had owed his life to the magnanimity of an insurgent who,holding him under his pistol, had fired into the air, instead of blowingout his brains.</p><p>Marius read. He had evidence, a certain date, irrefragable proof, thesetwo newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of backingup Thénardier&rsquo;s statements; the note printed in the <i>Moniteur</i> had been anadministrative communication from the Prefecture of Police. Marius couldnot doubt.</p><p>The information of the cashier-clerk had been false, and he himself hadbeen deceived.</p><p>Jean Valjean, who had suddenly grown grand, emerged from his cloud. Mariuscould not repress a cry of joy.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man! the whole of thatfortune really belonged to him! he is Madeleine, the providence of a wholecountryside! he is Jean Valjean, Javert&rsquo;s savior! he is a hero! he is asaint!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a saint, and he&rsquo;s not a hero!&rdquo; said Thénardier. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s anassassin and a robber.&rdquo;</p><p>And he added, in the tone of a man who begins to feel that he possessessome authority:</p><p>&ldquo;Let us be calm.&rdquo;</p><p>Robber, assassin&mdash;those words which Marius thought had disappearedand which returned, fell upon him like an ice-cold shower-bath.</p><p>&ldquo;Again!&rdquo; said he.</p><p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; ejaculated Thénardier. &ldquo;Jean Valjean did not rob Madeleine, buthe is a thief. He did not kill Javert, but he is a murderer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Will you speak,&rdquo; retorted Marius, &ldquo;of that miserable theft, committedforty years ago, and expiated, as your own newspapers prove, by a wholelife of repentance, of self-abnegation and of virtue?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I say assassination and theft, Monsieur le Baron, and I repeat that I amspeaking of actual facts. What I have to reveal to you is absolutelyunknown. It belongs to unpublished matter. And perhaps you will find in itthe source of the fortune so skilfully presented to Madame la Baronne byJean Valjean. I say skilfully, because, by a gift of that nature it wouldnot be so very unskilful to slip into an honorable house whose comfortsone would then share, and, at the same stroke, to conceal one&rsquo;s crime, andto enjoy one&rsquo;s theft, to bury one&rsquo;s name and to create for oneself afamily.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I might interrupt you at this point,&rdquo; said Marius, &ldquo;but go on.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron, I will tell you all, leaving the recompense to yourgenerosity. This secret is worth massive gold. You will say to me: &lsquo;Why donot you apply to Jean Valjean?&rsquo; For a very simple reason; I know that hehas stripped himself, and stripped himself in your favor, and I considerthe combination ingenious; but he has no longer a son, he would show mehis empty hands, and, since I am in need of some money for my trip to laJoya, I prefer you, you who have it all, to him who has nothing. I am alittle fatigued, permit me to take a chair.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same.</p><p>Thénardier installed himself on a tufted chair, picked up his twonewspapers, thrust them back into their envelope, and murmured as hepecked at the <i>Drapeau Blanc</i> with his nail: &ldquo;It cost me a good deal oftrouble to get this one.&rdquo;</p><p>That done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back of thechair, an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what they aresaying, then he entered upon his subject gravely, emphasizing his words:</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron, on the 6th of June, 1832, about a year ago, on the dayof the insurrection, a man was in the Grand Sewer of Paris, at the pointwhere the sewer enters the Seine, between the Pont des Invalides and thePont de Jéna.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius abruptly drew his chair closer to that of Thénardier. Thénardiernoticed this movement and continued with the deliberation of an orator whoholds his interlocutor and who feels his adversary palpitating under hiswords:</p><p>&ldquo;This man, forced to conceal himself, and for reasons, moreover, which areforeign to politics, had adopted the sewer as his domicile and had a keyto it. It was, I repeat, on the 6th of June; it might have been eighto&rsquo;clock in the evening. The man hears a noise in the sewer. Greatlysurprised, he hides himself and lies in wait. It was the sound offootsteps, some one was walking in the dark, and coming in his direction.Strange to say, there was another man in the sewer besides himself. Thegrating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off. A little light whichfell through it permitted him to recognize the newcomer, and to see thatthe man was carrying something on his back. He was walking in a bentattitude. The man who was walking in a bent attitude was an ex-convict,and what he was dragging on his shoulders was a corpse. Assassinationcaught in the very act, if ever there was such a thing. As for the theft,that is understood; one does not kill a man gratis. This convict was onhis way to fling the body into the river. One fact is to be noticed, thatbefore reaching the exit grating, this convict, who had come a longdistance in the sewer, must, necessarily, have encountered a frightfulquagmire where it seems as though he might have left the body, but thesewermen would have found the assassinated man the very next day, while atwork on the quagmire, and that did not suit the assassin&rsquo;s plans. He hadpreferred to traverse that quagmire with his burden, and his exertionsmust have been terrible, for it is impossible to risk one&rsquo;s life morecompletely; I don&rsquo;t understand how he could have come out of that alive.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius&rsquo; chair approached still nearer. Thénardier took advantage of thisto draw a long breath. He went on:</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron, a sewer is not the Champ de Mars. One lacks everythingthere, even room. When two men are there, they must meet. That is whathappened. The man domiciled there and the passer-by were forced to bideach other good-day, greatly to the regret of both. The passer-by said tothe inhabitant:&mdash;&ldquo;You see what I have on my back, I must get out, youhave the key, give it to me.&rdquo; That convict was a man of terrible strength.There was no way of refusing. Nevertheless, the man who had the keyparleyed, simply to gain time. He examined the dead man, but he could seenothing, except that the latter was young, well dressed, with the air ofbeing rich, and all disfigured with blood. While talking, the mancontrived to tear and pull off behind, without the assassin perceiving it,a bit of the assassinated man&rsquo;s coat. A document for conviction, youunderstand; a means of recovering the trace of things and of bringing homethe crime to the criminal. He put this document for conviction in hispocket. After which he opened the grating, made the man go out with hisembarrassment on his back, closed the grating again, and ran off, notcaring to be mixed up with the remainder of the adventure and above all,not wishing to be present when the assassin threw the assassinated maninto the river. Now you comprehend. The man who was carrying the corpsewas Jean Valjean; the one who had the key is speaking to you at thismoment; and the piece of the coat . . .&rdquo;</p><p>Thénardier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket, and holding,on a level with his eyes, nipped between his two thumbs and his twoforefingers, a strip of torn black cloth, all covered with dark spots.</p><p>Marius had sprung to his feet, pale, hardly able to draw his breath, withhis eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth, and, without uttering aword, without taking his eyes from that fragment, he retreated to the walland fumbled with his right hand along the wall for a key which was in thelock of a cupboard near the chimney.</p><p>He found the key, opened the cupboard, plunged his arm into it withoutlooking, and without his frightened gaze quitting the rag which Thénardierstill held outspread.</p><p>But Thénardier continued:</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron, I have the strongest of reasons for believing that theassassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by JeanValjean, and the bearer of an enormous sum of money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The young man was myself, and here is the coat!&rdquo; cried Marius, and heflung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood.</p><p>Then, snatching the fragment from the hands of Thénardier, he croucheddown over the coat, and laid the torn morsel against the tattered skirt.The rent fitted exactly, and the strip completed the coat.</p><p>Thénardier was petrified.</p><p>This is what he thought: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m struck all of a heap.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius rose to his feet trembling, despairing, radiant.</p><p>He fumbled in his pocket and stalked furiously to Thénardier, presentingto him and almost thrusting in his face his fist filled with bank-notesfor five hundred and a thousand francs.</p><p>&ldquo;You are an infamous wretch! you are a liar, a calumniator, a villain. Youcame to accuse that man, you have only justified him; you wanted to ruinhim, you have only succeeded in glorifying him. And it is you who are thethief! And it is you who are the assassin! I saw you, ThénardierJondrette, in that lair on the Rue de l&rsquo;Hôpital. I know enough about youto send you to the galleys and even further if I choose. Here are athousand francs, bully that you are!&rdquo;</p><p>And he flung a thousand franc note at Thénardier.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Jondrette Thénardier, vile rascal! Let this serve you as a lesson,you dealer in second-hand secrets, merchant of mysteries, rummager of theshadows, wretch! Take these five hundred francs and get out of here!Waterloo protects you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Waterloo!&rdquo; growled Thénardier, pocketing the five hundred francs alongwith the thousand.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, assassin! You there saved the life of a Colonel. . .&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Of a General,&rdquo; said Thénardier, elevating his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Of a Colonel!&rdquo; repeated Marius in a rage. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give a ha&rsquo;penny fora general. And you come here to commit infamies! I tell you that you havecommitted all crimes. Go! disappear! Only be happy, that is all that Idesire. Ah! monster! here are three thousand francs more. Take them. Youwill depart to-morrow, for America, with your daughter; for your wife isdead, you abominable liar. I shall watch over your departure, you ruffian,and at that moment I will count out to you twenty thousand francs. Go getyourself hung elsewhere!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Monsieur le Baron!&rdquo; replied Thénardier, bowing to the very earth,&ldquo;eternal gratitude.&rdquo; And Thénardier left the room, understanding nothing,stupefied and delighted with this sweet crushing beneath sacks of gold,and with that thunder which had burst forth over his head in bank-bills.</p><p>Struck by lightning he was, but he was also content; and he would havebeen greatly angered had he had a lightning rod to ward off such lightningas that.</p><p>Let us finish with this man at once.</p><p>Two days after the events which we are at this moment narrating, he setout, thanks to Marius&rsquo; care, for America under a false name, with hisdaughter Azelma, furnished with a draft on New York for twenty thousandfrancs.</p><p>The moral wretchedness of Thénardier, the bourgeois who had missed hisvocation, was irremediable. He was in America what he had been in Europe.Contact with an evil man sometimes suffices to corrupt a good action andto cause evil things to spring from it. With Marius&rsquo; money, Thénardier setup as a slave-dealer.</p><p>As soon as Thénardier had left the house, Marius rushed to the garden,where Cosette was still walking.</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette! Cosette!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come! come quick! Let us go. Basque, acarriage! Cosette, come. Ah! My God! It was he who saved my life! Let usnot lose a minute! Put on your shawl.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette thought him mad and obeyed.</p><p>He could not breathe, he laid his hand on his heart to restrain itsthrobbing. He paced back and forth with huge strides, he embraced Cosette:</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! Cosette! I am an unhappy wretch!&rdquo; said he.</p><p>Marius was bewildered. He began to catch a glimpse in Jean Valjean of someindescribably lofty and melancholy figure. An unheard-of virtue, supremeand sweet, humble in its immensity, appeared to him. The convict wastransfigured into Christ.</p><p>Marius was dazzled by this prodigy. He did not know precisely what hebeheld, but it was grand.</p><p>In an instant, a hackney-carriage stood in front of the door.</p><p>Marius helped Cosette in and darted in himself.</p><p>&ldquo;Driver,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé, Number 7.&rdquo;</p><p>The carriage drove off.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! what happiness!&rdquo; ejaculated Cosette. &ldquo;Rue de l&rsquo;Homme Armé, I did notdare to speak to you of that. We are going to see M. Jean.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thy father! Cosette, thy father more than ever. Cosette, I guess it. Youtold me that you had never received the letter that I sent you byGavroche. It must have fallen into his hands. Cosette, he went to thebarricade to save me. As it is a necessity with him to be an angel, hesaved others also; he saved Javert. He rescued me from that gulf to giveme to you. He carried me on his back through that frightful sewer. Ah! Iam a monster of ingratitude. Cosette, after having been your providence,he became mine. Just imagine, there was a terrible quagmire enough todrown one a hundred times over, to drown one in mire. Cosette! he made metraverse it. I was unconscious; I saw nothing, I heard nothing, I couldknow nothing of my own adventure. We are going to bring him back, to takehim with us, whether he is willing or not, he shall never leave us again.If only he is at home! Provided only that we can find him, I will pass therest of my life in venerating him. Yes, that is how it should be, do yousee, Cosette? Gavroche must have delivered my letter to him. All isexplained. You understand.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette did not understand a word.</p><p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she said to him.</p><p>Meanwhile the carriage rolled on.</p></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0364" id="link2HCH0364"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;A NIGHT BEHIND WHICH THERE IS DAY</h3><p>Jean Valjean turned round at the knock which he heard on his door.</p><p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he said feebly.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>Cosette and Marius made their appearance.</p><p>Cosette rushed into the room.</p><p>Marius remained on the threshold, leaning against the jamb of the door.</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette!&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>And he sat erect in his chair, his arms outstretched and trembling,haggard, livid, gloomy, an immense joy in his eyes.</p><p>Cosette, stifling with emotion, fell upon Jean Valjean&rsquo;s breast.</p><p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; said she.</p><p>Jean Valjean, overcome, stammered:</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette! she! you! Madame! it is thou! Ah! my God!&rdquo;</p><p>And, pressed close in Cosette&rsquo;s arms, he exclaimed:</p><p>&ldquo;It is thou! thou art here! Thou dost pardon me then!&rdquo;</p><p>Marius, lowering his eyelids, in order to keep his tears from flowing,took a step forward and murmured between lips convulsively contracted torepress his sobs:</p><p>&ldquo;My father!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you also, you pardon me!&rdquo; Jean Valjean said to him.</p><p>Marius could find no words, and Jean Valjean added:</p><p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette tore off her shawl and tossed her hat on the bed.</p><p>&ldquo;It embarrasses me,&rdquo; said she.</p><p>And, seating herself on the old man&rsquo;s knees, she put aside his white lockswith an adorable movement, and kissed his brow.</p><p>Jean Valjean, bewildered, let her have her own way.</p><p>Cosette, who only understood in a very confused manner, redoubled hercaresses, as though she desired to pay Marius&rsquo; debt.</p><p>Jean Valjean stammered:</p><p>&ldquo;How stupid people are! I thought that I should never see her again.Imagine, Monsieur Pontmercy, at the very moment when you entered, I wassaying to myself: &lsquo;All is over. Here is her little gown, I am a miserableman, I shall never see Cosette again,&rsquo; and I was saying that at the verymoment when you were mounting the stairs. Was not I an idiot? Just see howidiotic one can be! One reckons without the good God. The good God says:</p><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You fancy that you are about to be abandoned, stupid! No. No, thingswill not go so. Come, there is a good man yonder who is in need of anangel.&rsquo; And the angel comes, and one sees one&rsquo;s Cosette again! and onesees one&rsquo;s little Cosette once more! Ah! I was very unhappy.&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment he could not speak, then he went on:</p><p>&ldquo;I really needed to see Cosette a little bit now and then. A heart needs abone to gnaw. But I was perfectly conscious that I was in the way. I gavemyself reasons: &lsquo;They do not want you, keep in your own course, one hasnot the right to cling eternally.&rsquo; Ah! God be praised, I see her oncemore! Dost thou know, Cosette, thy husband is very handsome? Ah! what apretty embroidered collar thou hast on, luckily. I am fond of thatpattern. It was thy husband who chose it, was it not? And then, thoushouldst have some cashmere shawls. Let me call her thou, MonsieurPontmercy. It will not be for long.&rdquo;</p><p>And Cosette began again:</p><p>&ldquo;How wicked of you to have left us like that! Where did you go? Why haveyou stayed away so long? Formerly your journeys only lasted three or fourdays. I sent Nicolette, the answer always was: &lsquo;He is absent.&rsquo; How longhave you been back? Why did you not let us know? Do you know that you arevery much changed? Ah! what a naughty father! he has been ill, and we havenot known it! Stay, Marius, feel how cold his hand is!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you are here! Monsieur Pontmercy, you pardon me!&rdquo; repeated JeanValjean.</p><p>At that word which Jean Valjean had just uttered once more, all that wasswelling Marius&rsquo; heart found vent.</p><p>He burst forth:</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette, do you hear? he has come to that! he asks my forgiveness! And doyou know what he has done for me, Cosette? He has saved my life. He hasdone more&mdash;he has given you to me. And after having saved me, andafter having given you to me, Cosette, what has he done with himself? Hehas sacrificed himself. Behold the man. And he says to me the ingrate, tome the forgetful, to me the pitiless, to me the guilty one: Thanks!Cosette, my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too little.That barricade, that sewer, that furnace, that cesspool,&mdash;all that hetraversed for me, for thee, Cosette! He carried me away through all thedeaths which he put aside before me, and accepted for himself. Everycourage, every virtue, every heroism, every sanctity he possesses!Cosette, that man is an angel!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; said Jean Valjean in a low voice. &ldquo;Why tell all that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But you!&rdquo; cried Marius with a wrath in which there was veneration, &ldquo;whydid you not tell it to me? It is your own fault, too. You save people&rsquo;slives, and you conceal it from them! You do more, under the pretext ofunmasking yourself, you calumniate yourself. It is frightful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I told the truth,&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean.</p><p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; retorted Marius, &ldquo;the truth is the whole truth; and that you did nottell. You were Monsieur Madeleine, why not have said so? You saved Javert,why not have said so? I owed my life to you, why not have said so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because I thought as you do. I thought that you were in the right. It wasnecessary that I should go away. If you had known about that affair, ofthe sewer, you would have made me remain near you. I was therefore forcedto hold my peace. If I had spoken, it would have caused embarrassment inevery way.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It would have embarrassed what? embarrassed whom?&rdquo; retorted Marius. &ldquo;Doyou think that you are going to stay here? We shall carry you off. Ah!good heavens! when I reflect that it was by an accident that I havelearned all this. You form a part of ourselves. You are her father, andmine. You shall not pass another day in this dreadful house. Do notimagine that you will be here to-morrow.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, &ldquo;I shall not be here, but I shall not bewith you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; replied Marius. &ldquo;Ah! come now, we are not going topermit any more journeys. You shall never leave us again. You belong tous. We shall not loose our hold of you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This time it is for good,&rdquo; added Cosette. &ldquo;We have a carriage at thedoor. I shall run away with you. If necessary, I shall employ force.&rdquo;</p><p>And she laughingly made a movement to lift the old man in her arms.</p><p>&ldquo;Your chamber still stands ready in our house,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;If you onlyknew how pretty the garden is now! The azaleas are doing very well there.The walks are sanded with river sand; there are tiny violet shells. Youshall eat my strawberries. I water them myself. And no more &lsquo;madame,&rsquo; nomore &lsquo;Monsieur Jean,&rsquo; we are living under a Republic, everybody says <i>thou</i>,don&rsquo;t they, Marius? The programme is changed. If you only knew, father, Ihave had a sorrow, there was a robin redbreast which had made her nest ina hole in the wall, and a horrible cat ate her. My poor, pretty, littlerobin red-breast which used to put her head out of her window and look atme! I cried over it. I should have liked to kill the cat. But now nobodycries any more. Everybody laughs, everybody is happy. You are going tocome with us. How delighted grandfather will be! You shall have your plotin the garden, you shall cultivate it, and we shall see whether yourstrawberries are as fine as mine. And, then, I shall do everything thatyou wish, and then, you will obey me prettily.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean listened to her without hearing her. He heard the music ofher voice rather than the sense of her words; one of those large tearswhich are the sombre pearls of the soul welled up slowly in his eyes.</p><p>He murmured:</p><p>&ldquo;The proof that God is good is that she is here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; said Cosette.</p><p>Jean Valjean continued:</p><p>&ldquo;It is quite true that it would be charming for us to live together. Theirtrees are full of birds. I would walk with Cosette. It is sweet to beamong living people who bid each other &lsquo;good-day,&rsquo; who call to each otherin the garden. People see each other from early morning. We should eachcultivate our own little corner. She would make me eat her strawberries. Iwould make her gather my roses. That would be charming. Only . . .&rdquo;</p><p>He paused and said gently:</p><p>&ldquo;It is a pity.&rdquo;</p><p>The tear did not fall, it retreated, and Jean Valjean replaced it with asmile.</p><p>Cosette took both the old man&rsquo;s hands in hers.</p><p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;your hands are still colder than before. Are you ill?Do you suffer?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I? No,&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean. &ldquo;I am very well. Only . . .&rdquo;</p><p>He paused.</p><p>&ldquo;Only what?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am going to die presently.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette and Marius shuddered.</p><p>&ldquo;To die!&rdquo; exclaimed Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but that is nothing,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean.</p><p>He took breath, smiled and resumed:</p><p>&ldquo;Cosette, thou wert talking to me, go on, so thy little robin red-breastis dead? Speak, so that I may hear thy voice.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius gazed at the old man in amazement.</p><p>Cosette uttered a heartrending cry.</p><p>&ldquo;Father! my father! you will live. You are going to live. I insist uponyour living, do you hear?&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean raised his head towards her with adoration.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! yes, forbid me to die. Who knows? Perhaps I shall obey. I was on theverge of dying when you came. That stopped me, it seemed to me that I wasborn again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are full of strength and life,&rdquo; cried Marius. &ldquo;Do you imagine that aperson can die like this? You have had sorrow, you shall have no more. Itis I who ask your forgiveness, and on my knees! You are going to live, andto live with us, and to live a long time. We take possession of you oncemore. There are two of us here who will henceforth have no other thoughtthan your happiness.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; resumed Cosette, all bathed in tears, &ldquo;that Marius says thatyou shall not die.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean continued to smile.</p><p>&ldquo;Even if you were to take possession of me, Monsieur Pontmercy, would thatmake me other than I am? No, God has thought like you and myself, and hedoes not change his mind; it is useful for me to go. Death is a goodarrangement. God knows better than we what we need. May you be happy, mayMonsieur Pontmercy have Cosette, may youth wed the morning, may there bearound you, my children, lilacs and nightingales; may your life be abeautiful, sunny lawn, may all the enchantments of heaven fill your souls,and now let me, who am good for nothing, die; it is certain that all thisis right. Come, be reasonable, nothing is possible now, I am fullyconscious that all is over. And then, last night, I drank that whole jugof water. How good thy husband is, Cosette! Thou art much better off withhim than with me.&rdquo;</p><p>A noise became audible at the door.</p><p>It was the doctor entering.</p><p>&ldquo;Good-day, and farewell, doctor,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean. &ldquo;Here are my poorchildren.&rdquo;</p><p>Marius stepped up to the doctor. He addressed to him only this singleword: &ldquo;Monsieur? . . .&rdquo; But his manner of pronouncing it contained acomplete question.</p><p>The doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance.</p><p>&ldquo;Because things are not agreeable,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean, &ldquo;that is no reasonfor being unjust towards God.&rdquo;</p><p>A silence ensued.</p><p>All breasts were oppressed.</p><p>Jean Valjean turned to Cosette. He began to gaze at her as though hewished to retain her features for eternity.</p><p>In the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended, ecstasywas still possible to him when gazing at Cosette. The reflection of thatsweet face lighted up his pale visage.</p><p>The doctor felt of his pulse.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah! it was you that he wanted!&rdquo; he murmured, looking at Cosette andMarius.</p><p>And bending down to Marius&rsquo; ear, he added in a very low voice:</p><p>&ldquo;Too late.&rdquo;</p><p>Jean Valjean surveyed the doctor and Marius serenely, almost withoutceasing to gaze at Cosette.</p><p>These barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth:</p><p>&ldquo;It is nothing to die; it is dreadful not to live.&rdquo;</p><p>All at once he rose to his feet. These accesses of strength are sometimesthe sign of the death agony. He walked with a firm step to the wall,thrusting aside Marius and the doctor who tried to help him, detached fromthe wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended there, and returnedto his seat with all the freedom of movement of perfect health, and saidin a loud voice, as he laid the crucifix on the table:</p><p>&ldquo;Behold the great martyr.&rdquo;</p><p>Then his chest sank in, his head wavered, as though the intoxication ofthe tomb were seizing hold upon him.</p><p>His hands, which rested on his knees, began to press their nails into thestuff of his trousers.</p><p>Cosette supported his shoulders, and sobbed, and tried to speak to him,but could not.</p><p>Among the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies tears,they distinguished words like the following:</p><p>&ldquo;Father, do not leave us. Is it possible that we have found you only tolose you again?&rdquo;</p><p>It might be said that agony writhes. It goes, comes, advances towards thesepulchre, and returns towards life. There is groping in the action ofdying.</p><p>Jean Valjean rallied after this semi-swoon, shook his brow as though tomake the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucid oncemore.</p><p>He took a fold of Cosette&rsquo;s sleeve and kissed it.</p><p>&ldquo;He is coming back! doctor, he is coming back,&rdquo; cried Marius.</p><p>&ldquo;You are good, both of you,&rdquo; said Jean Valjean. &ldquo;I am going to tell youwhat has caused me pain. What has pained me, Monsieur Pontmercy, is thatyou have not been willing to touch that money. That money really belongsto your wife. I will explain to you, my children, and for that reason,also, I am glad to see you. Black jet comes from England, white jet comesfrom Norway. All this is in this paper, which you will read. Forbracelets, I invented a way of substituting for slides of soldered sheetiron, slides of iron laid together. It is prettier, better and lesscostly. You will understand how much money can be made in that way. SoCosette&rsquo;s fortune is really hers. I give you these details, in order thatyour mind may be set at rest.&rdquo;</p><p>The portress had come upstairs and was gazing in at the half-open door.The doctor dismissed her.</p><p>But he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dyingman before she disappeared: &ldquo;Would you like a priest?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I have had one,&rdquo; replied Jean Valjean.</p><p>And with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where onewould have said that he saw some one.</p><p>It is probable, in fact, that the Bishop was present at this death agony.</p><p>Cosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins.</p><p>Jean Valjean resumed:</p><p>&ldquo;Have no fear, Monsieur Pontmercy, I adjure you. The six hundred thousandfrancs really belong to Cosette. My life will have been wasted if you donot enjoy them! We managed to do very well with those glass goods. Werivalled what is called Berlin jewellery. However, we could not equal theblack glass of England. A gross, which contains twelve hundred very wellcut grains, only costs three francs.&rdquo;</p><p>When a being who is dear to us is on the point of death, we gaze upon himwith a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain hold himback.</p><p>Cosette gave her hand to Marius, and both, mute with anguish, not knowingwhat to say to the dying man, stood trembling and despairing before him.</p><p>Jean Valjean sank moment by moment. He was failing; he was drawing near tothe gloomy horizon.</p><p>His breath had become intermittent; a little rattling interrupted it. Hefound some difficulty in moving his forearm, his feet had lost allmovement, and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness ofbody increased, all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spread overhis brow. The light of the unknown world was already visible in his eyes.</p><p>His face paled and smiled. Life was no longer there, it was somethingelse.</p><p>His breath sank, his glance grew grander. He was a corpse on which thewings could be felt.</p><p>He made a sign to Cosette to draw near, then to Marius; the last minute ofthe last hour had, evidently, arrived.</p><p>He began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come froma distance, and one would have said that a wall now rose between them andhim.</p><p>&ldquo;Draw near, draw near, both of you. I love you dearly. Oh! how good it isto die like this! And thou lovest me also, my Cosette. I knew well thatthou still felt friendly towards thy poor old man. How kind it was of theeto place that pillow under my loins! Thou wilt weep for me a little, wiltthou not? Not too much. I do not wish thee to have any real griefs. Youmust enjoy yourselves a great deal, my children. I forgot to tell you thatthe profit was greater still on the buckles without tongues than on allthe rest. A gross of a dozen dozens cost ten francs and sold for sixty. Itreally was a good business. So there is no occasion for surprise at thesix hundred thousand francs, Monsieur Pontmercy. It is honest money. Youmay be rich with a tranquil mind. Thou must have a carriage, a box at thetheatres now and then, and handsome ball dresses, my Cosette, and then,thou must give good dinners to thy friends, and be very happy. I waswriting to Cosette a while ago. She will find my letter. I bequeath to herthe two candlesticks which stand on the chimney-piece. They are of silver,but to me they are gold, they are diamonds; they change candles which areplaced in them into wax-tapers. I do not know whether the person who gavethem to me is pleased with me yonder on high. I have done what I could. Mychildren, you will not forget that I am a poor man, you will have meburied in the first plot of earth that you find, under a stone to mark thespot. This is my wish. No name on the stone. If Cosette cares to come fora little while now and then, it will give me pleasure. And you too,Monsieur Pontmercy. I must admit that I have not always loved you. I askyour pardon for that. Now she and you form but one for me. I feel verygrateful to you. I am sure that you make Cosette happy. If you only knew,Monsieur Pontmercy, her pretty rosy cheeks were my delight; when I saw herin the least pale, I was sad. In the chest of drawers, there is abank-bill for five hundred francs. I have not touched it. It is for thepoor. Cosette, dost thou see thy little gown yonder on the bed? dost thourecognize it? That was ten years ago, however. How time flies! We havebeen very happy. All is over. Do not weep, my children, I am not goingvery far, I shall see you from there, you will only have to look at night,and you will see me smile. Cosette, dost thou remember Montfermeil? Thouwert in the forest, thou wert greatly terrified; dost thou remember how Itook hold of the handle of the water-bucket? That was the first time thatI touched thy poor, little hand. It was so cold! Ah! your hands were redthen, mademoiselle, they are very white now. And the big doll! dost thouremember? Thou didst call her Catherine. Thou regrettedest not havingtaken her to the convent! How thou didst make me laugh sometimes, my sweetangel! When it had been raining, thou didst float bits of straw on thegutters, and watch them pass away. One day I gave thee a willow battledoreand a shuttlecock with yellow, blue and green feathers. Thou hastforgotten it. Thou wert roguish so young! Thou didst play. Thou didst putcherries in thy ears. Those are things of the past. The forests throughwhich one has passed with one&rsquo;s child, the trees under which one hasstrolled, the convents where one has concealed oneself, the games, thehearty laughs of childhood, are shadows. I imagined that all that belongedto me. In that lay my stupidity. Those Thénardiers were wicked. Thou mustforgive them. Cosette, the moment has come to tell thee the name of thymother. She was called Fantine. Remember that name&mdash;Fantine. Kneelwhenever thou utterest it. She suffered much. She loved thee dearly. Shehad as much unhappiness as thou hast had happiness. That is the way Godapportions things. He is there on high, he sees us all, and he knows whathe does in the midst of his great stars. I am on the verge of departure,my children. Love each other well and always. There is nothing else butthat in the world: love for each other. You will think sometimes of thepoor old man who died here. Oh my Cosette, it is not my fault, indeed,that I have not seen thee all this time, it cut me to the heart; I went asfar as the corner of the street, I must have produced a queer effect onthe people who saw me pass, I was like a madman, I once went out withoutmy hat. I no longer see clearly, my children, I had still other things tosay, but never mind. Think a little of me. Come still nearer. I die happy.Give me your dear and well-beloved heads, so that I may lay my hands uponthem.&rdquo;</p><p>Cosette and Marius fell on their knees, in despair, suffocating withtears, each beneath one of Jean Valjean&rsquo;s hands. Those august hands nolonger moved.</p><p>He had fallen backwards, the light of the candles illuminated him.</p><p>His white face looked up to heaven, he allowed Cosette and Marius to coverhis hands with kisses.</p><p>He was dead.</p><p>The night was starless and extremely dark. No doubt, in the gloom, someimmense angel stood erect with wings outspread, awaiting that soul.</p><div class="fig" style="width:80%;"><a name="linkimage-0041" id="linkimage-0041"></a><img src="images/5b9-1-darkness.jpg" alt="Darkness" width="100%" /></div></div><!--end chapter--><div class="chapter"><h3><a name="link2HCH0365" id="link2HCH0365"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE GRASS COVERS AND THE RAIN EFFACES</h3><p>In the cemetery of Père-Lachaise, in the vicinity of the common grave, farfrom the elegant quarter of that city of sepulchres, far from all thetombs of fancy which display in the presence of eternity all the hideousfashions of death, in a deserted corner, beside an old wall, beneath agreat yew tree over which climbs the wild convolvulus, amid dandelions andmosses, there lies a stone. That stone is no more exempt than others fromthe leprosy of time, of dampness, of the lichens and from the defilementof the birds. The water turns it green, the air blackens it. It is notnear any path, and people are not fond of walking in that direction,because the grass is high and their feet are immediately wet. When thereis a little sunshine, the lizards come thither. All around there is aquivering of weeds. In the spring, linnets warble in the trees.</p><p>This stone is perfectly plain.

DAELLI</h3><p>Publisher of the Italian translation of <i>Les Misérables</i> in Milan.</p><p class="right">H<small>AUTEVILLE</small>-H<small>OUSE</small>, October 18, 1862.</p><p>You are right, sir, when you tell me that <i>Les Misérables</i> is written forall nations. I do not know whether it will be read by all, but I wrote itfor all. It is addressed to England as well as to Spain, to Italy as wellas to France, to Germany as well as to Ireland, to Republics which haveslaves as well as to Empires which have serfs. Social problems overstepfrontiers. The sores of the human race, those great sores which cover theglobe, do not halt at the red or blue lines traced upon the map. In everyplace where man is ignorant and despairing, in every place where woman issold for bread, wherever the child suffers for lack of the book whichshould instruct him and of the hearth which should warm him, the book of<i>Les Misérables</i> knocks at the door and says: &ldquo;Open to me, I come for you.&rdquo;</p><p>At the hour of civilization through which we are now passing, and which isstill so sombre, the <i>miserable&rsquo;s</i> name is Man; he is agonizing in allclimes, and he is groaning in all languages.</p><p>Your Italy is no more exempt from the evil than is our France. Youradmirable Italy has all miseries on the face of it. Does not banditism,that raging form of pauperism, inhabit your mountains? Few nations aremore deeply eaten by that ulcer of convents which I have endeavored tofathom. In spite of your possessing Rome, Milan, Naples, Palermo, Turin,Florence, Sienna, Pisa, Mantua, Bologna, Ferrara, Genoa, Venice, a heroichistory, sublime ruins, magnificent ruins, and superb cities, you are,like ourselves, poor. You are covered with marvels and vermin. Assuredly,the sun of Italy is splendid, but, alas, azure in the sky does not preventrags on man.</p><p>Like us, you have prejudices, superstitions, tyrannies, fanaticisms, blindlaws lending assistance to ignorant customs. You taste nothing of thepresent nor of the future without a flavor of the past being mingled withit. You have a barbarian, the monk, and a savage, the lazzarone. Thesocial question is the same for you as for us. There are a few less deathsfrom hunger with you, and a few more from fever; your social hygiene isnot much better than ours; shadows, which are Protestant in England, areCatholic in Italy; but, under different names, the <i>vescovo</i> is identicalwith the <i>bishop</i>, and it always means night, and of pretty nearly the samequality. To explain the Bible badly amounts to the same thing as tounderstand the Gospel badly.</p><p>Is it necessary to emphasize this? Must this melancholy parallelism be yetmore completely verified? Have you not indigent persons? Glance below.Have you not parasites? Glance up. Does not that hideous balance, whosetwo scales, pauperism and parasitism, so mournfully preserve their mutualequilibrium, oscillate before you as it does before us? Where is your armyof schoolmasters, the only army which civilization acknowledges?</p><p>Where are your free and compulsory schools? Does every one know how toread in the land of Dante and of Michael Angelo? Have you made publicschools of your barracks? Have you not, like ourselves, an opulentwar-budget and a paltry budget of education? Have not you also thatpassive obedience which is so easily converted into soldierly obedience?military establishment which pushes the regulations to the extreme offiring upon Garibaldi; that is to say, upon the living honor of Italy? Letus subject your social order to examination, let us take it where itstands and as it stands, let us view its flagrant offences, show me thewoman and the child. It is by the amount of protection with which thesetwo feeble creatures are surrounded that the degree of civilization is tobe measured. Is prostitution less heartrending in Naples than in Paris?What is the amount of truth that springs from your laws, and what amountof justice springs from your tribunals? Do you chance to be so fortunateas to be ignorant of the meaning of those gloomy words: publicprosecution, legal infamy, prison, the scaffold, the executioner, thedeath penalty? Italians, with you as with us, Beccaria is dead andFarinace is alive. And then, let us scrutinize your state reasons. Haveyou a government which comprehends the identity of morality and politics?You have reached the point where you grant amnesty to heroes! Somethingvery similar has been done in France. Stay, let us pass miseries inreview, let each one contribute his pile, you are as rich as we. Have younot, like ourselves, two condemnations, religious condemnation pronouncedby the priest, and social condemnation decreed by the judge? Oh, greatnation of Italy, thou resemblest the great nation of France! Alas! ourbrothers, you are, like ourselves, <i>Miserables</i>.</p><p>From the depths of the gloom wherein you dwell, you do not see much moredistinctly than we the radiant and distant portals of Eden. Only, thepriests are mistaken. These holy portals are before and not behind us.</p><p>I resume. This book, <i>Les Misérables</i>, is no less your mirror than ours.Certain men, certain castes, rise in revolt against this book,&mdash;Iunderstand that. Mirrors, those revealers of the truth, are hated; thatdoes not prevent them from being of use.</p><p>As for myself, I have written for all, with a profound love for my owncountry, but without being engrossed by France more than by any othernation. In proportion as I advance in life, I grow more simple, and Ibecome more and more patriotic for humanity.</p><p>This is, moreover, the tendency of our age, and the law of radiance of theFrench Revolution; books must cease to be exclusively French, Italian,German, Spanish, or English, and become European, I say more, human, ifthey are to correspond to the enlargement of civilization.</p><p>Hence a new logic of art, and of certain requirements of composition whichmodify everything, even the conditions, formerly narrow, of taste andlanguage, which must grow broader like all the rest.</p><p>In France, certain critics have reproached me, to my great delight, withhaving transgressed the bounds of what they call &ldquo;French taste&rdquo;; I shouldbe glad if this eulogium were merited.</p><p>In short, I am doing what I can, I suffer with the same universalsuffering, and I try to assuage it, I possess only the puny forces of aman, and I cry to all: &ldquo;Help me!&rdquo;</p><p>This, sir, is what your letter prompts me to say; I say it for you and foryour country. If I have insisted so strongly, it is because of one phrasein your letter. You write:&mdash;</p><p>&ldquo;There are Italians, and they are numerous, who say: &lsquo;This book, <i>LesMisérables</i>, is a French book. It does not concern us. Let the French readit as a history, we read it as a romance.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;Alas! I repeat, whetherwe be Italians or Frenchmen, misery concerns us all. Ever since historyhas been written, ever since philosophy has meditated, misery has been thegarment of the human race; the moment has at length arrived for tearingoff that rag, and for replacing, upon the naked limbs of the Man-People,the sinister fragment of the past with the grand purple robe of the dawn.</p><p>If this letter seems to you of service in enlightening some minds and indissipating some prejudices, you are at liberty to publish it, sir.Accept, I pray you, a renewed assurance of my very distinguishedsentiments.</p><p class="right">V<small>ICTOR</small> H<small>UGO</small>.</p><hr /><h3><a name="link2H_FOOT" id="link2H_FOOT"></a>FOOTNOTES:</h3><p class="foot"><a name="linknote-1" id="linknote-1"></a>1 (<a href="#linknoteref-1">return</a>)<br/>[Patois of the French Alps: <i>chat de maraude</i>, rascally marauder.]</p><p class="foot"><a name="linknote-2" id="linknote-2"></a>2 (<a href="#linknoteref-2">return</a>)<br/>[Liège: a cork-tree.
